exhibit d staff report ma rch  by william j driver congressional action involving portions of the foreign trade and investment act of  suddenly loomed as a possibility last week when it was learned that the aflcio planned to attempt attaching titles vi and vii of that proposed act to the administrations gold legislation through agreement with house ways and means committee chairman wilbur d mills dark the house banking and currency committee has been given jurisdiction over titles vi and vii of the socalled the latter committee scheduled gold bill hearings march  and immediately afterward is expected to begin executive session mark rapid enactment is anticipated organized labors position to be presented the last day of hear ings is that dollar devaluation in itself does not provide adequate remedies and that the stronger measures embodied in the hartkeburke bill are needed title vi of that measure would empower the president to prohibit any transactions involving direct or indirect transfer of capital to or within any foreign country when in his judgment the transfer would result in a net de crease in l s employment and any holder of a u s patent from manufacturing the patented product using the patented process licens ing others to manufacture the patented product or using the patented process outside united states territory when in the presidents judgment such prohibition will contribute to increased employment in the united states  title vii would require onerous reporting provisions including complete statistics on working conditions in multinational com panies outside the united states as well as or products and their distribution it also imposes burdensome requirements for labeling and advertising after key house committee members were alerted to organized labors strategy assurances were obtained that the gold legislation would be kept free of encumbering amendments and that the hartkeburke measures would be ruled nongermane on march  the senate approved the gold legislation required by the president to implement negotiated international monetary agree ments  cma qa  the senate subcommittee on the environment has begun executive session consideration of pending toxic substances legislation on february  the subcommittee staff made public working draft no  we were invited to submit for con sideration a memorandum dealing with section  of that document it was prepared by our general counsel and submitted on february  additional changes and improvements were recommended in more com prehensive comments on february  in a letter to the acting subcom mittee chairman senator william b spong dva we emphasized our concern over certain provisions relative to premarket testing of chemical substances and pointed out other needed improvements the house public works committee staff has insisted for some time that the language of the pending federal water pollution control act amendments h r  would would be made public on march  however present indications are it will not be released until mid or late march the committees formal report is expected about the same time consideration by the house rules committee will take place prior to house floor action the measure could reach senatehouse conference before easter a housesenate conference has approved legislation that would require the equal employ ment opportunity commission eeoc to seek court enforcement of its findings of job discrimination prompt approval by both houses and president nixon is expected the senate version of the measure generally prevailed broaden ing eecs purview to government and educational employees as well as reducing from  to  the number of workers in a company or union coming under its jurisdiction a consumer protection agency bill which passed the house last october is currently under con sideration in the senate government operations subcommittee on exec utive reorganization this bill s  would establish an independent consumer pro tection agency authorized to intervene on behalf of consumers in any federal agency where business regulation generally is at issue in addition the new agency could seek judicial review of any de cision by a federal agency that is considered to be contrary to the interests of consumers cma  t  we have burdensome make known government alerted mca legislative contacts to the disruptive and effects of this measure suggesting that affected companies their oppositionparticularly to members of the senate operations committee the executive operations subcommittee is expected to begin marking up this bill within the next three or four weeks oversight hearings    on implementation of the clean air act amendments of  were held recently  on january  by representative paul g rogers dfla of the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce and on february   by senator thomas f eagleton dmo of the senate committee on public works particular concern was expressed by democratic members of the congress that the office of management and budget mb was inter ceding in environmental protection agency epa affairs contrary to the intent of the congress persistently attacked was epas delay in issuing state requirements for preparation adoption and submittal of implementation plans epas administrator mr ruckelshaus had delayed their publication in order to revise them he deleted implications that approval of state plans would depend on inclusion of specified regulatory provisions and clearly identified them as possible state options thus allowing for alter native control strategies democrats and environmentalists alleged this change was the result of political pressures applied through mb however mr ruckelshaus defended the legal and technological soundness of his actions as indicated in the february report written testimony developed by our international trade committee has been presented to the senate subcommittee on foreign commerce and tourism in connection with their hearings on s  the export expansion act of  by letter on february  to the committees chairman senator daniel k inouye dhi we reiterated our position on upgrading commercial attaches using industry advisors during trade negotiations strengthening exportimport bank operations easing restraints on bank export financing ending freight rate disparities permitting more activities in foreign trade zones easing access to drawback opportunities ending foreign direct investment controls and on qualifying all export earnings for disc operations cma  two specific recommendations were to  require by law government use of business advisors in international trade negotiations  subsidize directly rather than indirectly operation of the u s merchant marine as a means of ending freight rate disparities were the topic at a meeting on february  at mca headquarters discussion centered on reported findings of medical researchers con cerning phthalate extraction by blood when stored in bags made of phthalateplasticized polyvinyl chloride film and observances of birth defects in rats when injected with types of phthalate esters used as plasticizers in plastics particularly polyvinyl chloride fortyfive representatives of  companies attended they wish to consider the development of a technical program and eight com panies volunteered representatives as an ad hoc planning group on phthalate studies with the understanding that any program proposal  involving mca administration would require your approval the association has extended its agreement with the university of michigan to maintain a registry of cases of acroosteolysis fingertip bone lesions and to provide a consultation center for industry  funded by contributions from  polyvinyl chloride

production workers as a pollutionprevention measure has proposed regulations concerning the design and construction of vessels and the operation of terminal facilities in oil transfer operations in general member companies have no objection to the proposal however since we believe some modification is necessary to provide for appropriate review preserve uniformity with present regulations and clarify intent of some of the proposals our comments were sub mitted to the coast guard on february  the interstate commerce commission cma  scheduled a modified procedure in response to our complaint concerning deficiencies in the tank car mileage allowance system adopted by railroads requesting written comment by february  however that date did not allow us sufficient time and our request for a

report of education activities committee to manufacturing chemists association november   by henry w rahn chairman it is three years since the eac committee last reported directly to this board in the interim several significant developments have occurred affecting the area wherein the committee functions  namely the industrialacademic interface these include first  employment opportunities for new technical graduates in the chemical industry shrank to low levels seeond  a wave of technical staff reductions by job termination ran through the industry in  and  and third  societys attitude toward our industry underwent deterioration to where we now labor under the burden of a negative public image it is most appropriate therefore and i welcome this op portunity to review for you the committees objectives plans and activities structured to meet our assignment and responsibility to the mca under conditions so changed from the past committee evolution the committee was first established in the mid s when as you will recall there was a shortage of graduate chemists the initial objective was to encourage students i pursue a career in chemistry so as to assure an adequate supply of chemists for the xpanding needs of our industry until the mid s the committee continued to follow a program of recruiting students into chemistry but then some red flags went up when careful reviews of technical graduate supplydemand studies lad several of our members to predict that the high post world war ii birth rates would result in an oversupply of chemists in the early s the rough coincidence of this graduate oversupply timing with the economic downturn of the chemical industry beginning in  and the layoffs of employed chemists and chemical engineers which ensued accelerated the rate at which the oversupply of unemployed ch micallytrained persons was growing as of earlier this year  of all chemists  years of age or less were unemployed faced with these unsettling aspects in the job market the committee decided to modify its objectives instead of stressing recruitment we began to focus on the quality and type of training suitable for chemists going into industry cma  future technical manpower supplydemand relationship in looking ahead we are confronted with a highly confused picture concerning the future demandsupply relationship for new graduate scientific and engineering man power major longrange studies reaching into the s by such prestigious groups as the national science foundation scientific manpower commission engineering manpower commission of the joint engineers council and the u s department of labor reach varying forecasts ranging from prediction of years of oversupply to dire warnings of impending shortages perhaps this is to be expected as the nation grapples with the problem of changing priorities and shifting activities and in view of this it would appear that the use of historical trend data for predicting technical manpower supplies ten years from now forces some degree of uncertainty into the forecasts but the weight of the evidence seems to lie on the side of an impending shortage the shortrange forecasts on the other hand as mode by similarly competent groups are considered to be much more reliable we can discuss these figures with more confidence in general such studies predict we will experience a sharp downward trend in bs ms and phd degrees awarded in chemistry and all engineering during the next four years if this downward trend continues there is reason to believe that a shortage of some proportions could develop in the supply of scientific and engineering graduates as responsible members of the chemical industry i believe there is cause for us to be  concerned over both the short and long range situation i will not burden you with a complete statistical analysis that supports this conclusion but here are some significant details first undergraduate enrollments for majors in chemistry have historically increased modestly each year in  however the number of ft s degrees awarded in chemistry declined for the first time in  years we conclude that a high drop out rate between entry and graduation for chemistry majors has taken place second the number of first year graduate students in phd chemistry programs has declined  since  statistics for each year indicate an increased number of students who earn a degree in chemistry only as a stepping stone to careers in other fields third undergraduate enrollments and earned degrees in engineering are declining significantly from the total engineering bachelor supply of  graduating in  the output in  is expected to fall to  against this background of rapidlydeclining interest in scientific and engineering degrees there are some that claim that even larger decreases in the employed technical woricforce may be necessary as an adjustment to changing r  d priorities if this be comes nee ssary i susp ct w will find the students moving ever farther away from the chemical industry a developm nt we would all like to avoid if possible cma  the chemical industry as you well know is an industry of great complexity requiring many high level intellects to effectively develop manage and operate the enterprise our future ability to attract such individuals in the numbers required will depend largely on the prestige of the occupation working conditions and personal opportunities for growth in attempting to assess future requirements for new graduate chemists and chemical engineers we make the prediction this number will remain a reasonably stable percentage f the total industrial workforce at the risk of oversimplification we have reached this conclusion by assuming two important opposing demand trends will tend to balance each other the downward trend involved rd during the past  years ift activities accounted for a large fraction of total technical employment with this fraction tending to become smaller as rd is deemphasized one can logically reason future needs for chemists and chemical engineers in this area will diminish on the other hand an upward trend involving newlyemerging problem areas such as environmental control and the impending energy crisis which heretofore have not been factors of any signifi cance as users or chemically trained personnel could possibly impose heavy future de mands against supply offsetting losses in the id sector of the chemical industry con sequently we believe continued reductions in chemistry and engineering majors and earned degrees will likely leadto shortages of technical graduate manpower resources in view of the uncertainty surrounding future needs it is tempting to adopt a wait and see attitude the committee counsels against this because to do so will undermine the attractiveness of chemistry and the chemical industry as a oareer choice for students  further it will likely intensify the negative image many students and young faculty specially in nonscience areas have for the chemical and other technicallyoriented industry and above all we must bear in mind that the manpower problems we anticipate in four or eight years are in fact todays problems because the new chemists and engineers  we will hire then are in the educational pipeline now restoration of confidence in industry if you agree with me that there has indeed been a loss of confidence by the student body in our industry the question then arises as to what steps we can take to restore it we of the committee feel this is a serious matter that should be promptly dealt with in some positive way in conjunction with the public relations committee we are organizing an effort to define a program for your consideration meanwhile i urge you to give with us serious consideration to this matter so that the mca and the industry can have an important continuing influence on the educational system and on national manpower planning commissions objectives  plans  activities  accomplishments against the foregoing background i would now like to report on our current programs and activities in  the board approved a realignment of our objectives and function according t the greatly altered mployment and economic eonditi ns confr nting member companies our objective became to promote through the educational system public understanding of the chemical industry to assist in career guidance to enhance the quality of education in chemistry chemical engineering and interdisciplinary fields related to chemistry to promote the teaching of chemistry and related sciences in a broad intellectual cultural and social context at all levels of education we thus reaffirmed our primary mission to collaborate with educators and educational systems our activities were then reorganized and channeled into three categories all judged to be of importance in attaining our objectives these are q i i career guidance chemical education public understanding of the chemical industry each area of concern is assigned to a separate mibcommittee concerning their work the following is of interest career guidance subcommittee this group finds itself in the paradoxical situation of motivating students toward chemistry at a time when trained scientists are unemployed this contrasts with a past period of more than two decades when expansion and growth of the industry assured multiple job opportunities for each new chemist employment prospects prevailing at the time a student made a career decision remained essentially unchanged  or  or  years later when he entered the job market specialization was the name of the game career objectives for specific positions could be described succinctly in terms of course require ments and skills career guidance was then a very legitimate facet of recruitment in advance when there are concrete job openings only recently have some associations professional societies and companies abandoned this activity in view of changed conditions some few years ago the career guidance subcommittee began to redirect its efforts to give greater emphasis to the variety of tasks performed in the chemical industry there is a continuing need for people with a chemical background but as you know the ap plication of their education and training might not conform to the traditional and academic image of the chemist or chemical engineer the subcommittee encourages those with particular ability and interest in chemistry to a career in r  d however for most in industry the translation of theoretical information into practical realities such as administration marketing personnel liaison with government and public re lations defines where the action is consequently an education should be directed to the broad spectrum of job opportunities and develop the individual interests and skills of the student several experimental career booklets were developed to present the new approach to more than  educators students and administrators who requested copies a new edition of the booklet will be distributed early next year incorporating many helpful suggesti ns received from teachers and students cma  t is courageous to phase out old and luccessful programs and innovate when our career guidance efforts rode the crest of the wave of acceptance among educators and students during the  fiscal year for example we filled requests for more than  career booklets and  flyers it is preferable as you will agree to be ahead of change rather than unwitting victims of it this subcommittee also assists and encourages the increased number of those who elect chemistry as a cultural background or as a foundation for careers in fields such as medicine law and marketing which have competing claims on technicallytrained men and women chemical education subcommittee this group spearheads efforts to influence chemical education as a measure of our success and acceptance among academic chemists during the past two years members f our committee have been participants by invitation at three major chemical education conferences and at tke white house conference on youth in the past year we collaborated by invitation with the national science foundation in the preliminary planning and implementation of a new educational program in which industry and the academe will jointly study the process of innovation and of expediting the process by which new ideas are transferred into curricula or marketable products the work of this subcommittee is now focused in three areas college and high school teacher awards influence on curricula interface conferences  college awards since s mca has honored  outstanding professors of chemistry and chemical engineering as one of the foremost national awards on the college level in the us and canada the program has attained prestige and is considered by many r cent recipients as the pinnacle of their teaching careers in  the six medalists were featured in a cover study in chemical and engineering news and a cover headline in the journal of chemical education a first for mca in each of these magazines in  we received more than  inquiries and processed  nominations both figures represent a high for the program as of this date we have proe ssed  inquiries and  nominations for the  program vit in the last two years we conferred five college awards on the campus of the recipient s veral of you represented mca at these ceremonies and contributed to this new dimension of industryeducation contact as a result of these campus ceremonies several major institutions reevaluated their programs honoring excellence among their faculty another plans to initiate an honors convocation and another broke an old tradition and gave public notice of the award at commencement cma   our college awards have been one of our least expensive but highest return activities high school awards since  mca has honored more than  secondary school teachers with local awards of  the program administered by chemical industry councils was restricted to teachers within the locale of the council in  we will open the program making any teacher in the us and canada eligible for a regional award of  or for the new national award of  the expanded program has aroused an enthusiastic response to date we have processed  requests for information and nomination forms influence on curricula for almost  years the chemical education subcommittee has promoted the inclusion of practical chemistry from industry into chemistry courses on the high school and lower college levels when we first made the suggestion our message went unheeded among educators who intensified the theoretical content of their chemistry courses recently other associations professional societies major chemical education conferences and educators concur with our proposal we collaborate with educators to ensure that the industrial world of chemistry is a necessary adjunct to theory in  the first title in a  book mcasponsored chemistry in action series was published by doubleday the books related practical stories and personal accounts of the world of industry almost  copies like the two samples i have here have been sold to enrich high school and lower level college chemistry courses eight of these titles appear in foreign language editions similar to this japanese version of water is everybodys business and one title in a us information service edition in ind ia the ftooks beportment of the american chemical society now publishes the series we cooperate in enlisting authors and assisting in the preparation of manuscripts  since  holt rinehard and winston published four mcasponsored innovative laboratory manuals for elementary and secondary schools more than  copies have been sold mca is widely known and esteemed for this service we will request modest funding to update one of these manuals in the next fiscal year we canvassed member companies and mode significant suggestions for the objectives and guidelines for undergraduate programs in chemistry for the committee on prof ssional training of acs john howard of kodak member of both our and the acs committee summarized and submitted our recommendations in the past six months the chairman of the acs committee acknowledged our contributions before more than  chairmen of college chemistry departments and on another occasion before more than  educators interface conferences we initiated experimental and innovative conferences of students educators and industrial people we have seen the effectiveness and predict an increasing need for this type of dialog members of the subcommittee share their exp rience with member companies who have organized similar sessions cma  b  public understanding of the chemical industry subcommittee the third and newest subcommittee of the education activities committee promotes gr ater public understanding of the chemical industry through the educational system their efforts are directed primarily to the nonscience student and faculty who harbor a negative attitude toward technicallyoriented industry many of these apostles to be sure have the naivete of youth but share with us in industry a bigness of concern f r society their zeal and energies seek direction toward constructive as well as destructive goals though some would write off this group as ignorant our contact with them through interface seminars indicates that they have done their homework well but often lack an overall and balanced view of a particular problem they are un informed for the most part of the accomplishments of industry for society however they are open and willing to learn and change their attitudes the subcommittee coordinates its efforts with mrs waltons consumer information subcommittee we make suitable education materials available to mrs waltons committee and distribute their materials designed to educate the general public through our education channels on three occasions we combined the consumer inf rmation and education exhibits to stretch our exhibit dollars and to reach new audiences f science and nonscience oriented publics at the suggestion of the consumer information group we published a manual of simple chemical demonstrations suitable for the general public and have another manual of simple food experiments in the rough manuscript staga mcas education exhibit provides us the opportunity to present all our programs and t discuss them with educators this past year more than  educators visited our booth at one regional and three national education conferences this year we have scheduled six exhibits in all sections of the us and seek similar contacts with canadian educators the two subcommittees also coordinated their efforts in presenting the seminar catalyst   is science necessary which i hope many of you were able to attend this morning the impact of electronic media on this generation indicates that the printed word is no longer the only effective avenue of communication an experimental tape for campus radio classroom or private listening was produced film clips slide lectures and audio courses are some of the means of communication which we will propose to you for future budget allocations as i indicated earlier there is on the drawing boards a joint task force with the public relations committee to study the negative image of industry among youth and make recommendations on what industry can do to stem the tide of unfair criticism which as you know often creates the unfavorable climate for adverse and restrictive legislation our work like public relations is never ending there is no such thing as a stable or onetime public publics are like rivers  more water always feeding into a stream which never stands still and n ver is quite the same at any one point of reference cma  thii about brings ma to the and of my report

chemists association  connecticut avenue n w washington d c    may   mca board of directors from special committee edward r kane chairman h harold bible george w russell final report the objective of this committee formed at the februaryexecutive committee meeting was to study how to make mca more effective with particular reference to but not limited to washington and government relations a preliminary report was made to the executive committee and to the board in march and several suggestions were approved the committee feels that this report represents only a first step towards strengthening mca and that the effectiveness of mca ought to be reviewed annually by the executive committee and the board discussions with a cross section of board members mca staff and member company personnel serving on mca committees and on the washington scene pointed to a central need and opportunity to improve communications the committee believes mcas communications can be improved in a number of areas by eliminating layering sharpening objec tives focusing efforts on key groups and coordinating the activities of various parts of the association therefore the following steps are recommended to strengthen mcas communications  the agenda for board meetings should be revamped to include additional reports from chairmen of technical and functional committees a regular review of legislative activity by the director of government re lations and periodic reports from other mca staff members as set forth in the recommended agenda attached as exhibit a the four board liaison committees should be eliminated also the scene should be set in a way cma  that will permit pointed questioning regarding and critical discussion of mca affairs  at least two more board meetings should be held each year in washington to focus attention on governmental matters and to facilitate con tacts with government personnel a recommended schedule of board meet ings for  is attached as exhibit b  closer communication between executive contacts especially thoae who are mca board members and personnel from their companies who serve on technical and functional committees is very much in order and needs to be encouraged  the executive committee in conformity with suggested changes in board procedures and in addition to its present activities should make an annual review of mca a effectiveness including the work of as well as the need for the various committees any action which would have a significant financial impact should be decided upon prior to january when development of the budget begins the executive committee should also formulate a list of the most critical issues facing the industry and indicate those issues for which mca positions should be developed a letter should be sent from the chairman of the board to all executive contacts following the june  greenbrier meeting outlining the newly adopted approaches and procedures for the  mca year and soliciting their active interest and participation board meetings the agenda for board meetings will be prepared by the president following consultation as appropriate with the chairman of the board and sent to the directors well in advance of meetings routine business of the association should be dealt with briefly on the assumption that directors had read the material which was supplied prior to the meeting of considerable importance is the arrangement of the agenda in such a way that there can be appropriate questioning and discussion regarding important mca matters at some past meetings several board members have felt the opportunity for meaningful discussion was limited or precluded providing for frank deliberation will permit a fuller contribution from the board and will recognize the considerable investment of time by board mem bers however this increased participation by the board in mca affairs should not be permitted to diminish the role and the effectiveness of the ex ecutive committee the president would present first an overview of mcas situation providing perspective and priorities with regard to important issues op portunities and problems cma  this would befollowed by a brief legislative report from the director of government relations plus reports from any other members of the mca staff who have an important matter to bring to the boards attention next three or four chairmen of technical or functional com mittees would report on substantive matters pending in those committees routine organizational matters and accomplishments should be excluded the four board liaison committees have helped a great deal but there is a prevailing opinion that the growing complexity and importance of the issues the industry is facing require the active and direct involvement of the board and that to shorten communications lines the liaison commit tees should be dissolved onethird of the  mca committees currently have chairmen from companies which are not represented on the board when one of these chairmen reports to the board the executive contact from his com pany should be invited to attend the meeting the above format would normally take two hours and this time should be regularly allotted in planning schedules two more washington board meetings january and october would improve communications considerably such meetings would also help focus board attention on the critical matters in the governmental area and provide an opportunity the night before the board meeting for members to have dinner with government people the successful chemical forum luncheons would be tied in the next day good staff work and coor dinated efforts are called for here to see that mca interests are effectively conveyed to the government with regard to regional board meetings the program commit tee ought to devote special attention to increasing their value to those at tending by providing a program which contributes insight into regional industry interests especially governmental activities government relations activity communications among the government relations staff other mca staff members the technical and functional committees and wash ington representatives of member companies should be improved through more formalized procedures in the past mca has been stymied at times by an inability to reach unanimous agreement in the various committees on what position to take and by a cumbersome clearance procedure in the future commit tees should try to proceed promptly to a decision and where unanimity is unattainable majority and minority views should be referred to the execu tive committee for consideration cma  exhibit a recommended agenda for mca board meetings opening remarks and introduction of guests approval of minutes

committee economic policy review committee senator hart has introduced a bill s  intended to facili tate the breakingup of large corporations in a number of industries including the chemical industry hearings before his subcommitt e cn antitrust and monopoly of the senate judiciary committee began lst year and will continue during this year and next there have already been two series of hearings on the general merits or demer its of the bill and one series devoted to communications parti cularly the bell system a series on the automobile industry will begin february  the chemical industry is not likely to have its day in court for many months to come while there is little prospect of the enactment of s  in its present form there is a danger that some elements of it may become law moreover the hart hearings are a forum in which major industries are under public attack and the chemical industry should be ready to defend itself it is not possible at this point to pre dict the character of the hearings on our industry as in the case of the bell system one major company may be chosen for attack  seems likely to be the case with the motor industry our entire industry may be exposed to rigorous review it is not known at prebent whether mca will be asked to appearnor has it been decided whether if not asked mca would choose to volunteer its testimony however it seems to the above committees the course of prudence to be prepared for all contingencies accordingly we propose that mca engage prof steven lustgarten of baruch college as a consultant to assemble and organise data demonstrating that the chemical indus try is not in need of deconcentration under senator harts proposed industrial reorganisation act  that it is in fact highly com petitive open to new entrants and a force restraining rather than sustaining inflation the detailed proposal of prof lustgarten is appended the proposal is budgeted for a cost of  this figure does not include the cost of printing the

the president urged the congress to take early action on welfare reform health services revenue sharing the environment consumer protection and transporta tion in addition to stressing the need for action on proposed en vironmental legislation the president stated he would soon be sending to the congress a message on the environment that would present further administrative and legislative initiatives the president also indicated that he would soon propose new legis lation concerning a new technology program with federal increase private research and incentives to federally supported research on a range of projects designed to improve our everyday lives another area involving new legislative proposals concerns edu cation the president stated he would recommend later in the year a new way of financing public schools to supplant reliance on local property taxes while no details were given it is under stood the administration has been studying the concept of a valueadded tax as a means of raising revenue to pay for local schools however passage of such legislation this year is improbable the nd congress reconvened on january  to start what leaders in both houses hope will be

ready for executive session consideration we have however complied with the request made by senator spong during our testimony last november  in a letter dated january  our views were transmitted concerning these aspects of amendment no  in which we questioned both the adequacy and usefulness of the definition of chemical substances as stated in section  and the potential value of a provisional certification subject to recall as a means of shortening the ad ministrative delays incident to full certification in the consumer protection area at least two measures probably will become law s  the consumer product warranties and federal trade com mission improvement act of  it passed the senate in november and should get through the house within the next few months and hr  the

legislation to halt it and a bill was introduced by senators bob packwood rore and jacob javits rny as senate joint resolution  the full senate labor committee began hearings on january  and was expected to complete consideration of the proposal within a week the measure would provide for the appointment of a man arbitration board to hear and settle the issues no strike or lockout would be permitted from the date the legislation was enacted until the day the arbitration board makes its deter mination the boards determination would be made within  days and would be binding on all parties for  months the president also requested enactment of the emergency public interest protection act of  s  and hr  which would provide permanent authority to settle strikes in the trans portation industry f while limited legislation to stop the west coast dock strike may be passed it will be extremely difficult to get permanent antistrike legislation through in an election year trade

missouri february  los angeles california february  in accordance with the clean air act amendments of  epas administrator is authorized to set emission standards for existing sources of air contaminants which he finds to be hazardous and can delay construction of a new emissions source for such air pollutants until he first determines that the new source if properly operated will not violate his standards mca is not participating in the above hearings however several member companies which produce chlorine and caustic by the mercury cell process are active through the chlorine institute last december  standards of performance for atmospheric emissions from new or substantially modified sulfuric and nitric acid plants were promulgated by epa together with those for fixed steam generators portland cement plants and municipaltype incinerators we submitted carefully documented comments on the proposed standards following their publication last august  however the final version took little cognizance of the economic and technological factors we presented as a result nine sulfuric acid producers representing ap proximately  of the industrys production capacity have joined to seek judicial review of the standards for sulfuric acid plants mca is not involved epa has announced its intention to propose federal standards of performance for atmospheric emissions from petrochemical processes at an early date and has invited the association to nominate industry representatives to an informal advisory groud to supplement the technical expertise of the epa staff in spite of limited success in previous efforts we feel we should continue to cooperate and we thank our members for volunteering their experts to serve on such advisory bodies epa is soon expected to publish proposed regulations govern ing control of hazardous substances in relation to water quality control which have long been in preparation we are seeking an opportunity for our technical specialists to cooperate in pre publication review of the proposal cma  r chemtrec the chemical emergency transportation center has received over  inbound calls since its inception september   some  calls concerned incidents involving chemicals in transit many were made simply to confirm chemtrecs existence a signi ficant but dwindling number of calls resulted from the telephone company having assigned chemtrec the discontinued reservation number of the howard johnson motel chain assistance has been provided in situations ranging from major train derailments to leaks in small packages tank cars and drums have been the containers involved in about twothirds of the incidents reported two problems involving ships in storms in the pacific ocean have been successfully handled and one call was from alaska during chemtrec planning it was anticipated that calls from emergency services fire police would predominate so far however carriers are far ahead in making use of the service hopefully this will dispose of many problems before they need emergency attention  operating experience to date confirms the validity of the chosen approach  providing immediate information from file then utilizing the expertise of shippers f reaction to chemtrec has been good from carriers and emer gency services alike prompt company followup has been an im portant factor in this achievement and cooperation by member companies generally as well as many nonmembers has been excel lent during the week of march  several workshops on chemtrec will be conducted by its manager john c zercher in los angeles san francisco portland and seattle target audiences are fire police and other emergency personnel plus nonmember chemical companies west coast assistance is by the southern california chemical manufacturers association and the chemical industry councils of northern california and the pacific northwest phthalates particularly phthalate esters used as plasticizers for plastics mainly polyvinyl chloride have been the subject of fa number of news items over the past year calling attention to potential health and ecological consequences from their widespread use  as yet there have been no allegations of harm to human health however researchers are concerned about finding these substances in the heart muscle of various animals extraction by the blood in hospital containers and effects observed in experimental animals cma  as a result one of our member companies suggested a con ference among technical representatives of interested companies to discuss reported findings and

of donald c winson on february   at the request of the air quality committee the board of directors approved regularization of the membership of donald c winson on this committee mr winson an outside counsel representing alcoa was recognized as a valid exception to the general principles applicable to the structure and operations of committees provision that membership be restricted to fulltime employees of member companies this action was made subject to annual staff review and board reconfirmation and on february   such reconfirmation was granted by the board as the factors leading to the earlier request remain equally valid the staff recommends the board approve mr winsons continuation as a member of the air quality committee subject to staff review and board reconfirmation at the end of another year staff proposal of february   is attached for information cma staff proposal concerning air quality committee membership of donald c winson frank l seamans outside counsel of the aluminum company of america was on the charter roster of the air quality committee when it was organized in  and was an outstanding contributor to its program in the early years upon adoption of the general principles applicable to the structure and operations of committees in  on his own initiative he inquired whether the requirement of membercompany fulltime employee for committee membership would affect his status general hull then mca president rul d that this preexisting menibership could continue undisturbed in  alcoa nominated donald cl winson a member of mr seamans legal firm as successor to mr seamans the record of board approval indicates only that mr winson represents alcoa with no evidence of recognition that he was not an alcoa employee the irregularity of his membership was brought out in a recent general review of committees by staff counsel the air quality committee is eager for mr winson to con tinue in full participation his background of legal specializa tion in industrial air pollution is comparatively rare and his leadership at this juncture is especially valuable he has been and is personally interested in continuing to be an active con tributor to the committees needs he can be particularly helpful in the organization and development of the recently authorized joint subcommittee on air and water pollution legislation and regulations accordingly primarily as a grandfather case and as such not otherwise setting a precedent and secondarily in recognition of continuing need by the committee for the services he is pecu liarly able to render the staff recommends that the board of directors regularize the membership of donald c winson on the air quality committee as an acknowledged exception to the membercompany fulltime employee qualification subject to staff review and board reconfirmation annually cma exhibit d report to the board of directors manufacturing chemists association bailey barton chairman air quality committee april   it is a pleasure to be here today to report on the air quality committees activities since my last presentation in february  we have i believe made some substantial contributions to the interests of the manufacturing chemists association i would be remiss however if i characterized our efforts as being successful in meeting our objectives you may recall that i described  as the year of opportunity for amending the clean air act in a positive way it is true that the activity of congress in clean air legislation served to restrain the fervor of the epa in enforcing  deadlines of the clean alp actas did a few court casesbut the legislation actually emerging from congressional com mittees offers precious little prospect of making the act more rea sonable it appears in fact that our environmentalist friends also saw  as a year of opportunity and seized the initiative in in fluencing even more stringent provisions than previously existed industry may for example petition extension from the previous dead lines but must meet rigid criteria waive some of its rights and be prepared to either post performance bonds or actually pay penalties for the delay most critical however are the provisions of both house and senate defining antidegradation or significant deteri oration in arbitrary numerical or percentage terms these provi sions coupled with another planning process cannot avoid a substantial and inevitable confrontation with industrial growth and development undoubtedly you are already aware of these and other extra polations of these amendments so i wont belabor the issues our committee prepared and mca submitted several commentaries and position papers to congress on these amendmentsas have many trade associations some concessions have been obtainedbut the only positive report i can make today is that these amendments are not yet law until they become so i pledge the air quality committ s continued diligence in attempting to bring about constructive leg islation cma  l  we have also been very active in environmental protection ag ncy r gulatory proceedings the two areas which were cited last year are still the hot ones epa with one notable exception has elected to j employ section iii to regulate emissions of substances which the admin  istrator may reasonably believe constitute a hazard the exception of course is the agencys choice of section the imminent hazard provisionto propose vinyl chloride monomer limitations the agency  has found that regulation of such emissions as sulfuric acid mist using  section iii requires far leas substantiation than a new ambient air quality standard moreover epa prefers the equipment efficiency approachbest practicable treatment if you willfthich this section provides we believe our committees careful scrutiny of these regu lations and the propensity of individual company members to litigate the issues they challenge have served to reduce the rate of promulga tion of such regulations we expect to continue following agency action from inception to promulgation on the multitude of materials waiting in this way we believe mca member compa  nies will profit by both technical input and uptodate communication of impending problems the second area i mentioned last year has a special significance the hydrocarbonphotochemical oxidant issueembryonic last february has reached full flower as a published policy of epa you may r call that the agency has concluded that all hydrocarbon emissions are ulti mately oxidantor smogforming compounds and must be controlled they are pressuring the states to tightenup hydrocarbon emission lim its in the hypothetical hope of meeting ambient air oxidant standards this is being manifest in storage tank vapor controlrequirements revision of the former rule  photochemicallyreactive compound limits to reflect broader volatile organic and generally in the transportation control strategy approach major impact of this shift in epa policy is being felt by our industry in the state of texas where hydrocarbon controls are being thrust upon them by epas infamous region vi in an effort to head off the potentially large expenditures thus required the mcaaffil iate texas chemical council has requested our assistance locally th y have been joined by the houston chamber of commerce and possess the indirect support of the texas air quality board staff through its own channels the american petroleum institute is pursuing a parallel course of opposition to epas hypothesis l  cmam in a november  presentation to top mca staff and air quality committee officers tcc leadership provided the outlines of a fourpoint program the moredetailed technical plans were presented to the full air quality committee in january  in houston texaswhere we had shifted our meeting for the purpose our committee sought out portions of the tcc program in which we could best serve all member companies we are preparing endeavors to obtain emission control cost data from member companies and definitive information on hydrocarbonoxidant relationships in several cities specific proposals for board authorization of funding should be completed shortly and in our view they repre sent substantive support to the texas chemical councils request for help this is also a primary result of our committees rather difficult task of negotiating a veritable maze of alternative approaches to this very complex question in a related develop ment epa has invited mca aqc participation in a reactivity task group which we expect will provide another avenue to explor ing the uncertainties of supporting data in the near future i am aware that it has been over a year since i told you that  was a reasonable sum to budget for this effortand i am grateful that you chose to budget halfthat  even though we have not until now offered a specific recommendation for its expenditure the data base which supports epas contentions has so many uncertainties that we have deemed it necessary to explore numerous possible avenues before focusing on the one which we believe to be most productive in terms of value received for money spent i appreciate your patience in this matter and believe that our committees deliberations since tccs first request in november will reward their patience as well i wont belabor the other com mittee and intercommittee activities which are underway the fore going have occupied most of the aqcs recent attention and are exemplary turning to another area of committee activityone to which the board responded to a concern expressed by all environmental committee officers last yearwe very much appreciate the guidance offered by dr taufens committee in resolving mca staff and tech nical committee relationship problems clair mr anderson and dr barnes were very sensitive to the cma   questions and comments which arose in our several sessions and encouraged initiation of communications sessions which have taken us far down the road of enlightenment this i hope will continue since it serves both the committees and the mca staffand ulti mately the membership of mca additionally i would personally recommend periodic detailed review by a board committee to insure expeditious resolution of staffcomnittee conflicts i must mention two remaining problem areas which i view as chronic first the delicate statutory and regulatory aspects of our work requireindeed they demanda unique technicallegal partnership to maximize effectiveness we engineers tend to over look legal subtleties in calculating the true effects of governmen tal proposals so we need to rehearse our thoughts in concert with detailminded working lawyers the legal advisory committee has addressed this issue and has offered constructive recommendations however translation of the abstract into the concrete has been difficult to consummate the air quality committee could be more effective if we had a participating attorney in our meetings and statutoryregulatory reviews i bring another unresolvedor perhaps i should say tem porarily resolvedproblem to your attention today because i view it as a chronic and strengthsapping enigma for most of  we had four nominees and no place for them the bylaws say for us to rotate off members when this situation existsbut every plan  offered was rejected by the full committee finally the officers chose in the face of indignation rebuke and even a threatened lawsuit to rotate off four lax attendees and seat the nominees but much valuable meeting time had been lost in the debate in my view our recent solution will only last until the next nominee comes along i will close my oral remarks by looking ahead to future endeavors for a few moments i see the air quality committees attention phasing from the old nuts and bolts control aspect into the more exotic health effects arena this will require a broader much more sophis ticated data base and perhaps more health oriented personnel to make meaningful contributions to association interests i also envision a committeestaff necessity to do much more extensive image building or more properlyimage repairing to counter the chemicals  cancer cma   psychology somehow we must convince congress of our value and most importantly i believe we are all a part of a fundamental struggle to keep free enterprise a viable concept in todays hostile climate you gentlemen our leaders our mentors and our sage ad visors hold the key to whether my generation will take the reins of our great american corporations or be relegated to civil servants in a new bureaucracy formerly called business total success i i cma  exhibit e report to the board of directors manufacturing chemists association dennis p bridge chairman solid wastes management committee april   the primary solid wastes management committee swmc concern is for legislative proposals for socalled hazardous waste materials for the last several years the swmc reports have indicated legislative activity during the previous year and the expectation of restrictive legislation the following year al though i am pleased to say that these forebodings have not come to pass i quickly note that the current situation is quite similar to that of past years  legislation may well be passed during this election year the first significant act dealing with solid waste was passed in  and the second legislative action followed in  during  there was legislative activity in this area and assuming five years to be a reasonable gestation period  could be the year this legislation will not be as far reaching as that being proposed for toxic substances but it will significantly impact chemical process industry cpi operations since the last swmc report to the board there have been nine major legislative proposals either actual bills or working drafts concerning solid waste of these the senate public works committee bill s  sponsored by senator jennings randolph and the house interstate and foreign commerce committee sub committee on transportation and commerce working draft as sponsored by congressman rooney are the two most likely candidates for enactment the administration has not sponsored a bill but has indicated general support of s  we expect that each proposal will reach its respective floor in may although with some undesirable provisions senator randolphs bill is certainly the more acceptable of the two proposals both documents contain hazardous waste sections but s  is much less complicated and it does not require federal approval for all permits for waste transport treatment and storage but rather concentrates on state implementation of a permit system similar to current air and water requirements the rooney proposal requires permits at both levels in addition it addresses several cma   i i i areas not included in s  such as product and container control as a means of source waste reduction and tax incentives for recycling we believe that the rooney working draft will be modified to resemble the senate public works proposal whatever the final form of the legislation mca will strongly espouse the concept of performance requirements for waste disposal rather than the predetermination or specification approach currently being fostered waste should be deemed hazardous only after its toxicity quantity and disposal site have been carefully considered predetermination of a waste disposal method without investigating each of these parameters is counterproductive because this restricts development of new technology and precludes the use of viable alternatives appropriate to specific geographical areas or to available equipment mca will contend that the authority over the areas of packaging transportation and storage of waste materials continue to be vested in the us department of trans portation should adoption of a permit system be unavoidable we will advocate that the disposal site rather than the generator be the permittee and that state implementation of the permit system under federal guidelines is preferred over direct federal intervention finally to provide for reasonable regulatory requirements from both a technical and economic viewpoint we will strive for sufficient time constraints and flexibility in any legislation to accommodate the dearth of technology and disposal cost data currently available to us many of the states most notably texas and california have  passed solid waste management legislation dealing with hazardous wastes because this legislation has preceded federal hazardous waste disposal activity it is quite likely that the epa may adopt those concepts fostered by these states which have proven to be most workable swmc monitors bellwether states for concepts which might be incorporated into federal regulations in addition liaison is being maintained with the national solid waste management association nswma to monitor its efforts to develop a legislative guide for use by each state ai  swmc legislative activity is directed almost solely to disposal of hazardous wastes chemical packaging has not been raised as an issue to date should this occur swmc will ask the chemical packaging committees assistance on this matter which is of vital importance to the cpi from a marketing as well as disposal viewpoint tl cma  a secondary but very important swmc concern is meaningful liaison with the epa solid waste control is unique among environ mental concerns because the epa has had a relatively long lead time to perform research and gather data to establish regulations on a more scientific basis while still complying with the stringent time frame expected in the enabling legislation swmc feels it important especially in view of epas intent to present mca positions at every opportunity during the past year there have been three salient examples of swmc work with epa first during our may   meeting epas office of solid waste management programs oswmp representatives made a presentation on an epa  million landfill project being conducted with the state of minnesota this project is intended to determine the effectiveness of modern land fill design and operational techniques several member companies are following this work closely second on december   at one of four epa public meetings on hazardous waste the chairman of swmc presented comprehensive testimony on behalf of mca in response to a formal epa request for such information the epa is now developing synopses of the various comments as a basis for its position on legislation and on subsequent regulations finally a meeting was held with personnel from the epas solid and hazardous waste research division municipal environmental research laboratory in cincinnati ohio in conjunction with a regular swmc meeting swmc members have repeatedly expressed a desire to investigate the possibilities of contracting research work to fill existing data gaps in the area of landfill disposal of potentially hazardous wastes to avoid duplication it is important that we ascertain the scope of epa research activities the epa presentation and suggestions were well received and very beneficial in guiding us toward an appropriate research activity to be identified by our technical subcommittee a compendium of  successful case histories of waste recycling or residua disposal is being developed by the technical subcommittee this document will provide positive cpi input to various legislative and regulatory proposals with respect to the significant amount of current work within industry on disposal of potentially hazardous wastes a joint subcommittee composed of representatives of the swmc and water resources committee was formed in  to develop guidelines for deepwell disposal this document has just been published cma  the concept of land use regulation continues to disturb swmc members and representatives of the other environmental committees land use legislation could be the most insidious tool available to those who would punitively regulate the cpi forms of land use regulation are currently embodied in federal air water and coastal zone management legislation and several land use proposals have been made relative to solid waste dis posal as a result of the total environmertal implications of this issue the task group on land use consisting of two repre sentatives from each of the three environmental committees was established at the swmcs request the group is to review the question of land use with respect to possible implications on cpi operations and to make appropriate recommendations to the mca board for action during its organizational meeting the group concluded that prior to developing recommendations for mca board action there is a definite need to ascertain current cpi status with respect to all existing federal and regional land use legislation because of the legal nature of the activity mca staff through the joint subcommittee on environmental law jsel or other legal source has been formally requested to develop this information for the task group by july   the task group will then develop its recommendations to mca by september  the question of jsel continuation under review by the legal advisory committee for some time has reportedly been resolved in that jsel will remain intact and function in a manner yet to be defined we have been assured by mca staff that legal assistance will be available upon request at present at least two formal requests have been made to jsel by swmc seeking legal assistance these include upcoming proposals on solid waste legislation and the land use issue in order to properly address these important issues it is imperative that legal as well as technical expertise be readily available to date in keeping with past jsel performance we have not received indication that consideration of our requests has been initiated if we are to effectively influence and combat unacceptable legis lative proposals adequate legal assistance is a must with the exception of the jsel question some progress has been made in improving internal mca communications and organiza tional difficulties which were highlighted in the previous two swmc reports as per recommendations of the ad hoc committee on environmental affairs two meetings have been held between environmental committee chairmen and various mca staff to discuss mca administrative procedures and methods by which mca can act in a more unified and timely fashion as a result of these meetings several measures have been recommended to foster improvement one of these provides for government relations department input into environmental committee meetings on a continuing basis a member of the government relations staff has been assigned to work with swmc in liaison capacity this in addition to the consistent and competent efforts of our current staff secretary should be beneficial to swmc activities to insure that a continuing dialogue is maintained among all facets of mca environmental affairs i recommend that a meeting of environmental committee members and appropriate mca staff be held annually to provide a forum for exchange and coordination of information from all relevant sources review of mca administration procedures and resolution of issues involving more than one of the environmental committees in conclusion swmc is concerned with the ultimate disposal of potentially hazardous wastes of all the areas of environ mental control ultimate disposal most readily reflects the need for a total environmental control approach we may see sig nificant successes in air and water pollution abatement processes but what has the cpi really accomplished if these successes are  negated because we are unable to dispose of the abatement process residues or other potentially hazardous wastes in a technically and economically feasible manner we believe that if the legal governmental and technical expertise which should be available to us through mca auspices can be combined into timely action we need not be the weak link in the chain of total environmental control dennis p bridge chairman cma  exhibit e report by the director of government relations william m stover may   senate committee working on tax legislation the senate finance committee began markup of tax reformtax reduction legislation on april  and is expected to report some type of tax measure by midjune although it is not clear just what the scope of the committees action will be it is entirely  possible that their bill will simply extend tax reduction pro visions which expire on june  thus delaying action on a tax reform package until later in the year senator russell long chairman of the finance conxnittee has indicated that such a course is a distinct possibility during the past two weeks of markup sessions the senate committee dealt primarily with tax shelters of little direct interest to the chemical industry it is significant to note however that most decisions could be characterized as easing off on limitations or restrictions included in the housepassed tax reform bill hr  many observers are concluding therefore that when the conmictee takes up capital formation and foreign income provisions its actions will be generally more favorable to industry than chat of the house however there is still danger ahead whenever a tax bill comes up for senate floor action  be it a simple extension of expiring tax reduction provisions or a comprehensive tax reform tax reduction package  senator kennedy and several other reformminded senators are expected to introduce a number of antibusiness amendments these are likely to include proposals to repeal de ferral of taxation of income of foreign subsidiaries restrict the use of the foreign tax credit eliminate disc entirely repeal the asset depreciation range adr system and repeal the percen tage depletion allowance for hard minerals cma  the fate of these extreme amendments will depend on the ability of the business community to convince a majority of senators of the damaging impact of the proposals on u s business and the general economy this was emphasized yesterday by u s senator herman e talmadge of georgia secondranking democrat on the senate finance committee in addressing mcas chemical forum he urged company officials to communicate their views on tax changes to all senators and especially to those on the finance committee in order to stimulate savings and capital investment senator talmadge indicated that he favored proposals recommended by the administration and supported by mca to make the  investment tax credit permanent to reduce the corporate tax rate eliminate double taxation of corporate profits and to modify the present method of taxing capital gains he fully supports retention of the foreign tax credit and disc and firmly opposes any changes that would materially alter and burden the competitive position of our companies operating abroad it is his opinion that many members of the finance committee shared his views on these matters various business organizations are urging industry spokesmen to contact all senators with whom they have constituent relations to make known their views on these issues we certainly support this line of action and believe that such contacts should be made before june  clean air amendments hit snag in senate the public works committees of both the house and senate have reported bills in what is the first attempt at comprehensive re vision of the clean air act of  pl  an emotional struggle is under way over provisions contained in both bills intended to protect clean air against significant deterioration both bills establish certain mandatory class i areas where only small amounts of additional pollution would be allowed the committees say their nondeterioration proposals would give states more control over the classification process than do the epas present regulations industry views this approach as thinly disguised federal landuse control cma   in the senate there are signs that support is growing for an amendment proposed by senator frank moss d utah the democratic leadership has recently postponed until early june the floor de bate on senator muskies bill s  the moss amendment would defer the new nondeterioration restrictions for one year during that period a national commission on air quality established in the senate bill studies the economic and energy impacts of the proposal and considers whether the government has enough technical information to implement it by late april senator moss had gathered  cosponsors six republicans and six democrats the hasty decision to postpone floor action is being interpreted as an indication that his pro posal now has the backing to be adopted and that opponents need more time to solidify their opposition mca is therefore con tinuing to work to build support for the moss amendment we are urging that member companies communicate with senators on this subject as soon as possible the house interstate pected to file the report the next few days there the house might await the and foreign commerce committee is ex on its air quality amendments bill within now appears to be some possibility that outcome of senate action before proceeding the solid waste utilization act  will it pass the senate public works committee has scheduled markup on proposed solid waste utilization legislation for may  and  last july committee chairman senator jennings randolph dwva introduced s  resulting from extensive hearings held during  last monday may  the committee staff issued a new working print of the bill which will now become the basis for the markup the hous interstate and foreign commerce subcommittee on transportation and commerce issued a draft solid waste bill last december which was considerably more comprehensive than the orig inal senate bill we now understand that the subcommittee has abandoned the first draft because of adverse reactions and that another draft will emerge in midmay which will be less contro versial and more likely to attract wide support the subcommittee expects to hold hearings following issuance of the new draft bill cma  last summer we submitted our own markedup version of s  to the senate public works committee we did the same with the house transportation and commerce subcommittee december draft in related developments a house government operations sub committee has conducted oversight hearings on solid waste and a house science and technology subcommittee has held hearings on several research and development bills related to solid waste and resource recovery issues oversight recommendations and rd legislative proposals will be given consideration and possible incorporation by the subcommittee on transportation and commerce in its writing of the major house solid waste bill judging from the events discussed above and the general con sensus on capitol hill there appears to be a good possibility of new solid waste legislation this year osha oversight hearings hearings on worker exposure to toxic materials are scheduled in the house government operations manpower subcomnittee this tuesday and wednesday may  and  and continuing may  the subcommittee plans to investigate the adequacy of osha health standards whether the procurement systems of gsa and dod include screening for toxic substances and subsequent worker noti fication and whether dangerous chemicals in the workplace may be more widespread than generally recognized witnesses scheduled for tuesday may  include representa tives of the national institute for occupational safety and health and ocaw oil chemical and atomic workers union on may  the subcomnittee will hear dr morton corn assistant secretary of labor for osha also appearing will be a spokesman for mca mr emil e christofano chairman of the mca occupational health committee mr christofano is an industrial hygienist for hercules incorporated cma  exhibit f report to the board of directors manufacturing chemists association food gary a sunshine chairman drug and cosmetic chemicals committee may   it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to report to you on the activities of the fdcc committee and to share with you thoughts that have grown out of my association with the work of the committee during the past year as you know the objectives and the function of the fdcc committee are as follows to advise thp board of directors concerning chemicals used in foods drugs and cosmetics and in accord with association policies and procedures develop positions on legislation and regulations affect ing such chemicals formulate principles and encourage technical development pertinent to their use and cooperate with other organizations having parallel interests considering the rapid rate of developments in the past few years these responsibilities represent no small task the activities of the committee during the past year have been directed largely toward consolidating and implementing organizational improvements initiated during the preceding year the organizational structure that has been established consists essentially of a legislative and regulatory subcommittee a scientific subcommittee and a commun ications subcommittee which are designed to closely follow develop ments in their respective areas the subcommittees through their respective chairmen and the steering subcommittee function by developing and referring welldeveloped reports and proposals to the full committee for review and action this structural concept takes advantage of the available manpower by establishing a welldefined division of the work areas eliminating repetitious meetings and concentrating on developing concrete proposals for the basis of committee action task force units with specific areas of assign ment within these broad lines of division have also been used to advantage cma  during the past year for example the committee prepared and submitted extensive comments on the fda proposed administrative practices and procedures regulations of particular importance to mca was the fda position stated in section  b of these proposed regulations that any representation made by a trade association shall be on behalf of its members and shall constitute a represen tation on behalf of each member of the trade association except those specifically excluded by name in any such submission the obstacles to equitable administration of justice under the law that could be evoked by such a provision are so numerous as to preclude detailed reference in this report such objections have been fully documented in our submission to fda other features of the proposed regulations to which we have submitted substantial comments have included a proposed limitation on the opportunity to present oral testimony and to crossexamine witnesses during hearings and the establishment of criteria which the fda asserted constituted a proper basis on which to deny a petition or right to a hearing these provisions and others of varying degrees of importance and impact are not merely a codification of existing fda procedures but in many respects represent a basic change in practices that restrict the rights of individuals subject to the agencys jurisdiction to obtain consideration and review another legislative development of importance which is now under review by the legislative and regulatory subcommittee is the kennedy food surveillance bill s although originally heralded as applying primarily to food manufacturing and processing establish ments this proposed legislation has implications extending beyond these areas under the manufacturing sections surveillance features are included relating to the establishment of safety assurance pro cedures within plants product coding record keeping and inspections in addition the bill contains provisions for requiring registration of food establishments however in a broader context the bill imposes obligations on food processors to immediately notify the institution of a recall as well as the possibility that processed foods may be adulterated citizens civil actions also are authorrized under the bill additionally the bill contains extensive new requirements pertaining to the label identification of all ingredients in addition to these activities the committee has also monitored the nci carcinogenic bioassay program the fcc and faowho monographs for food chemicals and the fda review of gras substances cma  these activities have been carried out primarily under the program of the scientific subcommittee together with a number of other projects relating to technical developments in the area of food drug and cosmetic chemicals the development of proposed good manufacturing practices guidelines for bulk drugs and food chemicals is presently under study by this subcommittee in addition technical liaison is carried out with the activities of pma as they relate to bulk drugs and with gma as they relate to food chemicals a project presently active within the communications sub committee is the development of a proposal for the formation of a chemical industry information center although the details of the organization and operation of such a center and various considerations relating to its establishment are not yet defined in concrete terms it is believed that such a center could help to improve the publics understanding of questions and controversies that confront our industry while the above describe briefly the broad spectrum of activ ties that have been carried forward during the past year a summary of the committees activities would not be complete without an appropriate evaluation of this work as it relates to the objectives of the committees responsibilities to mca such objectives clearly must be understood in the light of the legislative and regulatory climate that exists today seen in this perspective one can only feel a keen sense of inadequacy  of constantly striving to barely keep up with developments and the frustration of being able only to superficially react to the various problems that continue to arise despite the diligent efforts of restructuring the fdcc committee it is believed that a more fundamental reevaluation of the mca activity in this area should be undertaken course a variety of ways in which response to the greater burden in this area of our activities can be made i would not propose as part of this brief report to attempt to define in detail any partic ular solution it is appropriate however to recognize that the time may have arrived whep the means which have served us well in the past are no longer adequate to serve industries needs in the area of food drug and cosmetic chemicals mca has always prided itself on the fact that committee leader ship and most of the working input comes from the member companies i suggest that this policy may no longer be appropriate in areas of cma  fli proliferating legislation and regulation such as food drug and cosmetic law these regulations are targeted at many areas frequently beyond the scope of interest of any single member company therefore i urge this board to appoint a committee to study the issue of from where should the leadership of any particular committee come should it be from the mca staff or should it continue to come from the member companies the conclusion may not be the same for all committees nevertheless x think this situation should be given a fresh look i f cma  exhibit g report to the board of directors manufacturing chemists association george a coffenberg chairman transportation and distribution committee may   in ray initial report for the transportation and distribution committee on april  of last year i restricted my comments to two items of major sig nificance having future impact on the chemical industry a more detailed report on the committees activities was appended to my remarks today my oral report will focus on three topics and i refer you to the filed report for the balance the chemical industry owns or operates approximately  tank cars and is compensated by the railroads through a mileage allowance of from  to  per loaded car mile depending on the value of the car the rail roads pay an allowance to suppliers of private rail cars in that freight rates take into consideration a cost to the railroads of supplying cars prior to  the allowance per mile was a onelevel allowance a car owner or opera tor was paid the same rate per mile irrespective of whether a car had a value the chemical industry having the newer and higher valued cars was of the opinion that the compensation paid by the railroads should recognize the difference of investment in the cars and pay a higher allowance to the more valuable cars than paid to cars of lower value after long negotiations a trilevel system of compensation was established in november  however because of disagreement among the railroads as to how the system was to w rk the matter was contested before the interstate commerce commission icc with the car suppliers on one side and the railroads on the other coomienclng in  through may of this year three major car compensa tion cases have been adjudicated before the icc in  after a fav rable icc decision to an mca complaint the threelevel system of compensation es tablished in  was changed to a sixlevel system however the rates of compensation to be paid by the railroads were frozen to car values established in  the final case icc docket  instituted by mca over four years ago is about to be discontinued as a result of an interim agreement negotia ted between the litigants the negotiations followed a favorable decision by division  for mca mcas complaint was supported by the american petroleum  institute the corn refiners association the institute of shortening and edible oils the major tank car leasing companies and allied chemical corp ra tion the interim agreement accomplishes the following  the mileage rate for all six levels of compensation was to be increased on thirty days notice by  this increase became effective may   tank car compen sation had not been increased since january   it is estlmatad that the increase annualized will return to the tank car perators an additional  million the chemical industrys share is estimated at  million cma  sine  the railroads only adjusted tank car compen sation upward afcer adjudication of a complaint before the icc the agreement provides chat tank car compensa tion will be adjusted in relation to and at the time the railroads adjust the compensation paid one another for use of each others cars the railroads have increased the compensation paid to each ocher four times aggregat ing  since the last time tank car compensation was increased we expecc the new rates of compensation effective may i will again be increased in the first quarter of  when the railroads increase car compensa tion to each other new tank cars entering the rail fleet frozen at  valuations for the purpose of compensation will now enter the fleet at their fair market value for example a car valued in  dollars at  will call for a mileage race of  per loaded mile whereas prior to this agreement such cars would have been adjusted by a formula to a value of  and compensated at a rate of  existing cars will be reevaluated and if the fair markec value of the car places it in a higher mile age group the car will be reassigned to the higher group tank car owners and operators will support the establish ment of an equalization rule whereby the railroads will be compensated for excess empty miles when empty miles exceed loaded miles by more than  the icc will issue an order commencing a rule making proceeding for the purpose of establishing rules and methods for determining cank car compensation in the future when completed the icc will issue another or der canceling the interim agreement and prescribing the basis on which tank car compensation is to be paid and the mechanisms for its implementation rule making may take as long as three years to complete in summary we not only see the light at the end of the tunnel but we can see the end of the tunnel during che next three years complex and difficult negotiating will be carried out with the railroads under icc super vision mcas objective will be to do its best to assure that the rules finally prescribed will provide equitable compensation for those who supply tank cars last report dealt at length with public law  the federal water pollution control act and in particular the  amendments covering spills of hazardous polluting substances and the civil penalties provided for such spills in section  i advised that an ad hoc interindustry committee including mca was seeking legislative relief from the punitive provisions of this section hr  was introduced september   to amend several sections of the law and section  of the bill while not totally to the lik ing of the ad hoc committee would have been a vast improvement from the existing law mca testified in support of the bill with caveats as to the cma  meaning intended by certain language in the bill mca offered to work with the environmental protection agency epa on the development of guidelines to carry out the intent of cne dubious language along the lines of mcas testi mony epa administrator russell train testified in support of hr  including support of section  the desired revisions in the law as en compassed in section  were recommended by the house public works subcom mittee handling the bill however in markup before the full house committee on public works and transportation the penalty language in section  underwent a significant and unfortunate twist the bill provided for a maximum penalty of  in markup to placate certain committee members who were seeking to preserve the maximum penalty of  when from a vessel and  when from a shorebased facility as provided in the  amendments the committee ap proved a threetier approach to penalties the amendment in effect provides a maximum penalty of  for a first spill a maximum of  for a second spill and a maximum of  for spills in excess of two during a threeyear period the markup made no change in the language concerning spills involving willful negligence or willful misconduct hr  is expected to obtain a rule from the rules committee for con sideration by the house some time this month tt is the best judgment of those who are familiar with legislative procedures that the markup committee has made such a christmas tree of the bill chat it stands a very good chance of being voted down by the house if this does not occur because s  the senates companion bill is so different than hr  an ef fort will be made to return the penalty language to its original form during the house and senate conference the fallback position will be to eliminate section  in its entirety the transportation of hazardous materials continues to receive adverse publicity far out of proportion to the safety its transportation record de serves the department of transportation dot through its director of the office of hazardous materials when testifying on the transportation safety act of  estimated that there are over two billion tons of hazsrdous materials shipped annually with as many as  shipments tendered daily major accidents involving hazardous materials have been relatively few when considering the exposure but each one raises new cries for increased regula tion since  the department of transportation has been attempting to develop a new hazard information system integrating vehicle placards and shipping papers with the ability for a quick emergency response the dots most recent effort is an advance notice of rule making identified hazardous materials docket no  the xt requested that responses to the docket evaluate nine hazard information systems proposed by respondents in a past docket against nine criteria that a hazard information system should meet mcas response was a modification of its prior proposal and it is believed more adequately meets the nine criteria than any of the other systems it integrates the vehicle placards the shipping papers an lnmediate ability to respond and chektrec the system is not only practical for implementa tion domestically including lntermodal transportation but is readily adapt able for international shipments we believe the mca response is the lead ing candidate to be adopted by the dot as a basis for a rule making proceed ing

with little or no justification mca challenged these dock et and in all but isolated situations the dockets were later withdrawn by the carriers dot issued emergency order no  requiring dot specifications a and a on uninsulated pressure tank cars containing flanmable gases to be shoved to rest prohibiting humping or rolling switch es as a result of railroad accidents in which such cars

class for truckload shipments regardless of the classification rating for a par ticular product challenged this arbitrary action by the national classification board has been placed in suspension by the board and is believed dead the federal government as an offset to the truckers because of the national maximum speed limit of  miles per hour authorised an increase in the maximum weight for trucks on the defense and inter state highway system from a gross weight of  to  pounds in order for vehicles to leave the interstate system to pick up and deliver freight state weight limits must be increased allowing the higher gross weight the committee has recommended support for state actions raising state weights to the interstate level physical distribution at a oneday educational seminar

continue to aim for october  adjournment of the th congress despite the fact that both houses appear on schedule some observers are skeptical since congress rately meets deadlines for ending its work not only are the remaining days few in number but thoughts of the november election are proving increasingly distracting  to members a number of congressmen have already gone home to campaign and attendance problems could cause difficulty for party leaders in these closing weeks as they attempt to complete  remaining legislation the final days before adjournment are always a difficult and uncertain period for congress and for those who follow its activities closely time pressures and distractions lead to hasty action in some cases and the legislative process becomes all the more unpredictable nonetheless it is possible to speak with assurance on the fate of several important bills which have received our attention in recent months  the patent reform bill earlier passed in objectionable form by the senate will die in the house judiciary committee  oil divestiture legislation never really got off the ground but is certain to prove controversial in   the bill providing for deregulation of natural gas is stalled cma   on the other hand passage appears likely for the air quality act amendments and for a toxic substances control bill the parens patriae bill is still alive a major antitrust reform bill continues to move through the congress the senate last week passed a very tough and controversial version as a result parliamentary maneuvering is underway as opponents seek to block passage by the house the major provisions of the legislation are  expanded investigative authority for the department of justice and the federal trade commission  requirement for premerger notification of justice and ftc where companies fit certain trigger guidelines thus giving the government the opportunity to block intended mergers  the controversial parens patriae section allowing state attorneys general to bring trebledamages classaction suits against businesses on behalf of the states citizens water quality amendments nearing conference house and senate conferees will soon meet to determine the fate of a bill amending the federal water pollution control act in several significant respects major point of contention will be the wording of the wetlands section  that is how to control pollution resulting from dredge and fill operations in wetlands lakes and streams other provisions  construction grants for municipal sewage treatment plants  funding for epa aid in the form of loan guarantees for cities shares of federallyfunded sewage treatment projects  modification of deadlines within which public treatment plants must meet requirements cma  r the wetlands pollution controversy arises as a result of regulations written by the army corps of engineers pursuant to the original federal water pollution control act of   a  court ruling held that these regulations apply to all waters of the u s and not just those defined as navigable under the law staff members of the house and senate public works committees have been meeting in an effort to find a basis for compromise regardless of the outcome the next congress will be con ducting an indepth review of pl  and the report of the presidents commission on water quality mca expects to take an active role in those deliberations and our preparations are already underway enactment seems likely for solid waste legislation the senate calls it solid waste utilization while the house refers to it as resource conservation and recovery but whatever the name a new solid waste law appears to be in prospect m the senate passed s  last june in a generally acceptable form in recent months the house interstate and foreign commerce committee has been at work on several versions of its own subcommittee draft language was circulated for comment and a number of helpful changes incorporated the committee bill has now been cleared for house floor consideration next week it appears unlikely that the housesenate conference will encounter substantial difficulty and enactment appears to be a good bet industry appears favorably inclined toward both bills the major provisions  mandatory federal standards on hazardous waste including its generation transport storage and disposal epa may delegate implementation to the states  epa guidelines for state solid waste management plans with grants and technical aid handled through a new office of discarded materials  substantial epa research and development programs aimed at smallscale and lowtechnology systems sludge management reducing air quality problems from incineration and energy recovery cma    study programs in eleven specified areas including plastics recovery energy recovery sludge reduction and waste reduction outlook favorable for massive tax reform bill it has taken two years over a thousand pages of text and two weeks of intensive housesenate conferences but the massive tax reform bill is finally near enactment it must be considered the most significant tax bill since  since it impacts the taxation of every individual and corporation in the united states the bill extends through next year although in somewhat different form the antirecession tax cuts voted last year by the congress it places higher taxes on upperbracket taxpayers through increased minimum taxes and reduction of tax shelters it alters treatment of estate and gift taxes deductions for the use of private homes in business deductions for vacation homes and individual retirement accounts especially significant is the fact that the bill raises approximately  billion in revenue for the next fiscal year this was essentially the target of the house bill and of both the senate and house budget committees the bill is therefore regarded as something of a victory for house ways and means committee chairman a ullman dore and for the new congressional budgetsetting process itself to refresh your memory the tax reform act passed the house in december  and in the spring underwent hearings in the senate finance committee for about two months mr f perry wilson testified on behalf of mca urging adoption of provisions which would encourage capital investment and opposing changes in tax provisions related to foreign operations of u s companies the committee completed markup of its bill in midjune and the senate floor debate began later that month a bipartisan coalition of moderates led by senator russell long held off the efforts of reformers to add a variety of antibusiness amendments the senate passed the measure in early august last week house and senate conferees reached agreement on all pro visions j the conference compromise contains the following items of interest to our industry cma  i  canital formation and corporate tax rates the investment tax credit is extended for  years corporate tax rates are set at  on the first above  these levels are extended through  taxpayers who are now allowed a year carryback and a year carryforward of net operating losses will receive an additional two years to write off their losses the minimum tax rate for corporations is increased the month holding period for longterm capital gains is increased to  months in  and to one year in  foreign source income disc benefits are applicable to that increment of export gross receipts which exceed  of base period gross receipts the base period will be taxable years  to  illegal payments to foreign officials may not be deducted do not reduce earnings and profits and are deemed immediately repatriated for tax purposes companies complying or cooperating with international boycotts are denied the foreign tax credit deferral and disc benefits on that portion of their income related to the boycott the provision would not apply to boycotts approved or agreed to by the u s the earned income abroad exclusion is reduced to the conferees agreed to remove energy tax provisions from the tax reform bill preferring to handle this area separately in a last minute change they included state tax reform provisions cm  exhibit g report to board of directors manufacturing chemists association fletcher l byrom chairman economic policy review committee september   the economic outlook there is some concern by many in industry that july and august have been more than the normal doldrums of summer certainly many areas have been fitful at best on the other hand early august sales in major retail chains have evidenced encouraging strength the real nagging concern is the lack of any strength in the housing market and no signs yet of any major move in plant and equipment expenditures inflationary pressures are at least passive for the present but again projections of shortages in primary industry with only slight increases in capacity utilization due to the lack of new capacity installations in recent years are a cause for real concern to many the question of where eight million college students will get jobs and what their reactions will be if they do not find the kind of employment to which they feel they are entitled the continuing decapitalization of primary capitalintensive industry due to inadequate depreciation policy and the failure to date of much of industry to reduce its dividendpayout ratios in order to compensate for the shortfall in depreciation the inability to economically justify new plant expenditures on the basis of present profit levels  all these concerns hang like a heavy cloud over a recovery which to many is not as buoyant as they might have hoped admitting that to others the lack of boom conditions is a good sign for a lengthy recovery period add to this the voiced concern of the believers in the kondratieff longwave cycle theory and you tend to join tillich when he said we must learn to be comfortable with ambiguity wage and price controls cma  wage and price controls continue in effect in canada so that canadian member companies of mca as well as us member companies ln their canadian operations face problems similar to those which confronted us industry during the  period here in the united states the council on wage and price stability continues to focus attention on situations it regards as inflationary however while it does have subpoena power it has no enforcement authority in view of the solid opposition of both business and labor there is no present likelihood of the renewed imposition of mandatory wage and price controls  the hart bills senator hart of michigan three years ago introduced a bill titled the industrial reorganization act and last year rein troduced a slightly revised version the bill was intended to facilitate the splitting of companies in a number of named industries into smaller units provided that certain arbitrary arithmetical measures indicate the existence of economic concentration in the given industry the chemical industry was one of seven listed as a possible target this bill was formally abandoned by senator hart on may  this year he conceded that its enactment was not politically feasiblein the foreseeable future he then introduced a more modest monopolization reform act s  it would amend the sherman antitrust act in four respects it would eliminate any requirement of proof of intent to monopolize in actions brought by the united states it would eliminate superior performance as a defense to actions brought by the united states  it would eliminate the prima facie effect of a government judgment in such an action for subsequent private triple damages it would allow courts to take into consideration economics of scale in fashioning remedies no action is expected this year on this new hart bill and indeed in view of senator harts decision not to seek reelection its future is dubious when the hart industrial reorganization act was first introduced mca in order to be prepared for all contingencies engaged an economic consultant professor steven lustgarten of baruch college cma  r city university of new york to assist in preparing the chemical in dustrys case his report an analysis of the chemical industry in view of the proposals for deconcentration has been completed and is available while senator harts judiciary subcommittee on anti trust and monopoly did not in fact hold any hearings on the chemical industry the lustgarten report should be helpful in case congress in the future should turn its attention to our industry  divestiture in the oil industry es i since the energy crisis initiated by the arab oil boycott in  there has been growing pressure inside congress and outside for divestiture in the oil industry  vertical divestiture limiting oil companies to one or two of the four basic functions of the in dustry production transportation refining and marketing and horizontal divestiture requiring oil and gas producers to divest their interests in other energy sources coal uranium oil shale by a vote of  to  the senate judiciary committee has reported out s  a vertical divestiture bill it would require the  largest oil companies to divest themselves of vertically integrated holdings within five years no further action is expected on the bill this year the administration opposes it on the whole democratic presidential nominee carter inclines against vertical divestiture although he seems to favor horizontal divestiture the economic policy review committee has recommended that mca oppos legislative divestiture andor divorcement of the oil in dustry and similar congressional efforts in other major indus  federal chartering of corporations a series of senate commerce committee hearings chaired by senator hartke were held early this summer on the issues of corporat responsibilityfederal chartering offering ralph nader a forum in which to push his advocacy of federal chartering for larger corporations a favorite cause of his however with both the ford administration and democratic presidential nominee carter in opposition to this it appears unlikely to get anywhere for the time being the economic policy review committee will continue to monitor any developments in this area  economic planning task force cmast a task force h aded by harold passer of eastman kodak has been organized to review the various proposals in the area of eco nomic planning being mooted in the congress and elsewhere it will hold its first meeting september   multinational corporations the economic policy review committee is represented by two members on a special mca task force dealing with the problems facing multinational corporations other mca committees represented are tax policy international trade government relations and public relations multinational corporations are under study andor attack in a number of international and national forums there is the un commission on transnational corporations with a related un information and research center there is the international labor organization ilo which is conducting a study on the social impact of multinational corporations there is the organization of american there is the un conference on trade and development unctad where the third world nations rally for their attack upon and there is most constructively from the point of view of industry the organization for economic cooperation and development at home the most important forums are senator churchs sub committee on multinational corporations and the taxwriting com mittees of the congress  ways and means in the house and finance in the senate the task force has been monitoring developments in all these forums thanks to an effective industry educational campaign the drive for punitive taxation of mncs was largely turned back in the house ways and means and senate finance committees the most dynamitepacked issue however is that of payoffs abroad the administration is sponsoring a bill calling in effect for dis closure while a bill approved by the senate banking committee would outlaw such payments multinational corporations got off reasonably well at the annual meeting of the ilo this summer the un commission on transnational corporations is at work on guidelines but is not scheduled to produce them for eighteen months or so by far the most important recent development on the interi national stage was the adoption by the oecd on june  of a statement on international investment and multinational enterprises cma  this statement the product of lengthy negotiations among the  industrialized nations represented in the oecd sets forth sound voluntary standards for business conduct throughout the world and includes many of the principles long endorsed by mca member companies operating internationally in particular the statement  provides for national treatment of enterprises owned by foreign investors so that they will be accorded treatment no less favorable than that accorded domestic enterprises in like situations  recognizes the sanctity of contracts between governments and enterprises  recognizes the positive contributions which multinational enterprises can make to world economic and social progress  encourages the use of international arbitration in resolving disputes between governments and enterprises the oecd statement is not only important in itself but should enable the industrial nations to take a unified and constructive posture as the debate over multinational corporations progresses in the wider forum of the united nations cma  exhibit h report to board of directors manufacturing chemists association ronald s wishart jrf chairman energy conservation committee september   this is the first report of the energy conservation committee established by the board of directors at its november  meeting up to that date and beginning in october  an ad hoc committee had dealt with energy conservation matters from october  onward the committee has maintained where legally feasible a close liaison and active cooperation with the department of comm rce and with the fea and its contractors since its establishment two major responsibilities the committee has been dealing with  supervising the ongoing voluntary program of twiceyearly reports on energy conservation to the department of commerce and the f deral energy administration as of the preparation of this report the most recent energy conservation report was that submitt d in april  of this year in which  mca member companies participated the report showed energy conservation for the calendar year  as  per unit of output compared with  as a base year without the energy costs of osha and environmental regulations in effect in  but not in  the energy conserva tion rate would have been  an overriding reason for the relative modesty of these figures was that due to the recession our industry was operating at only  of capacity in  com pared with  in  there are very few major mca member companies not taking part in mcas energy reporting program or those of other relevant associ ations such as the fertilizer institute and the pharmaceutical manufacturers association these few companies have been individually contacted and will hopefully be taking part in the next report to the two federal agencies due in midseptember this voluntary program is the result ofan october  meeting between top commerce department and fea officials and top officials of some  major chemical companies all mca members at this meeting there was agr ement on a consensus energy conservation goal of  per unit of output by calendar  as compared with cma  calendar   since december  when the president signed into law the energy policy and conservation act the committee has been seeking to cope with the new industrial energy conservation pro visions which are part of this act the act focuses on the ten leading energyconsuming industries by twodigit sic codes officially identified early this year not surprisingly our industry sic  ranks first for each of these top  industries fea is to set an energy conservation goal replacing the consensus goals under which many industries including ours have been operating fea has contracted with outside consultants to study each of the ten industries and propose goals  which of course fea can accept or modify because of the complexity of the chemical industry fea initially had difficulty getting an appropriate contractor to take on the job however thanks in part to mcas interest in having a qualified contractor take on this responsibility battelle memorial institute finally undertook it with chem systems as subcontractor the engineering and technical subcommittee of the energy conservation committee worked closely with the contractors aiding them individually and collectively in their demanding task and contributing their ex pertise in methodology the contractors have submitted their report and it will be published in the federal register in late september with public hearings in october it is quite possible that consumer and environmental groups may testify in opposition to any proposed reasonable target for our industry so mca must be prepared to testify in its own behalf internal studies carried on by the committee indicate that the in dustry can meet a target in the neighborhood of  in further conformity with epca requirements fea must identify the top energyconsuming companies in each of the ten alreadyiden tified industries  either the  highestranking companies or those using over a trillion btus in energy per year whichever number is smaller some  companies reporting through mca have listed energy purchases of over a trillion btus a year and there may be other such companies reporting through the fertilizer institute etc it therefore seems likely that the cutoff point for chemical companies will be somewhat over a trillion btus per cma  r under epca provisions and regulations companies reporting through industry programs such as mcas may be exempted from indi vidual reporting even if it would otherwise be required of them the criteria for acceptable industry programs will be published in the federal register however because fea is falling behind its epca timetable there remains a  chance that companies may have to file at least one mandatory individual report in early  another section of epca provides for the encouragement and subsidy of state energy programs here mcas prime interest is in exempting major industries like ours from reporting to the various states since they already report to federal agencies if however some states insist upon industrial energy conservation reporting w would urge them to adopt the same system already in effect for federal reporting after monitoring two regional hearings on state programs mca testified to this effect at the plenary hearing in washington in july another area of fea concern outside of epca is its program to promote fuel conversion from oil and gas to coal the future issues subcommittee of the energy conservation committee has monitored the questionnaires to be sent out to companies in this area and has made recommendations which have been persuasively relayed to fea through a task force of the industrial energy users forum  a genuine success was realized in modifying some unreasonable re quests  eg obtrusive financial questions in the major fuelburning installation questionnaire the energy conservation committee has four subcommittees engineering and technical state relations fuel types and future issues it has also established fruitful liaison with three other mca standing committees government relations legal advisory and public relations government relations contacts have been useful in dealing with legislation going through the congress concerned in one way or another with energy conservation public relations have helped in the explanation of the effect on energy conservation of the relatively low capacity at which the industry was functioning in calendar   and our presentation in this regard was welcomed by the department of commerce and the federal energy administration as supportiv of their reports to the public furthermore public relations ass mbled and distributed internal and external publica tions by m mber companies designed to promote energy conservation we shall look to legal advisory liaison for advice in preparing testimony for the various

september   you will recall that it is the responsibility of the patent nd trademark committee to maintain an awareness of new developments in the industrial property field having present or prospective impact on the chemical industry to determine mca positions where warranted and to act either directly or through the board of directors as is apprpriate in making mca viewpoints known last october i had the opportunity to report to you on the status of patent legislation in the congress you will recall it was predicted that s would be passed by the senate and forwarded to he house for their consideration you will also recall that in the hkinion of your patent committee s is an illconceived piece of legislation which will have a serious negative impact on the value of the patent system s was passed by the senate and sent to the house with little substantive amendment despite serious efforts by mca and others  to modify and improve objectionable sections as of today it appears unlikely that the house subcommittee responsible for patent legislation will get to s this year and as a result it will die with this congress while this is welcome news in that it maintains the status quo for the time being we can very likely expect renewed activity next year i should note that several changes are needed to improve the patent system and that the most important of these  a system for the reexamination of patents  is the subject of another bill sponsored by rep wiggins of california rep wiggins is minority leader of the house subcommittee concerned with patent legislation and he appears to be concerned with preserving and strengthening the patent system our committee is prepared to continue to assist in the development of constructive changes in the law and its primary efforts wil continue to be geared in this direction i wish to speak briefly about what is happening in the interional area but before proceeding in that direction i should note at patent committee has also provided comments to erda on a  patent policy basically we recommended a policy designed attract participation in governmentsponsored research by companies cma  with a background and experience in the energy field to this end we urged adoption of a policy which would provide a flexible approach to ownership of patents resulting from governmentsponsored rd and wh would permit the government administrator to grant exclusive or partially exclusive licenses to energy inventors where title is vested in the government to proceed now with developments in the international area you are all aware of the changing attitudes of many of the developing countries in the industrial property and technology transfer areas this has resulted in new laws in mexico and other south american j countries a proposed new law in canada and a great deal of activity in various un agencies and the organization of american states etc  since a number of mca member companies are concerned with these changes we are seeking to define the part mca should play in this connection while to date our activity has been limited we have been consulted by and have provided our comments to the us government negotiators with regard to efforts by developing countries to change the paris convention on patents and trademarks in addition and in response to  notification of a proposed negative change in the patent law of taiwan affecting the chemical industry an ad hoc group of patent committee members together with the us assistant commissioner of patents were invited to meet with the taiwanese minister of economic affairs to assist him in understanding the economic consequences of whai they were proposing to do this meeting was held and it appeared to those present that they achieved a substantial portion of our objective and that the proposed change will be moderated we will gain a better feel for this as we experience patent office decisions in the future j on another front canada is proposing a number of radical changes to their patent law which if accepted would substantially reduce the attractiveness of seeking patents in canada commissioner of patents together with a small industry group has been invited by the authors of the proposed changes to meet with them to discuss the ramifications of adoption while this is not solely an mca patent coirmittee activity we are heavily represented the delegation is intended to be a crosssection of us industry and in addition to mca members dupont phillips merck and monsanto both ibm and ge will participate the meeting is scheduled for october  and preparations are in full swing finally it is my strong feeling that mca must continue to play a role exus and we will be attempting to define this role more clearly in the coming year cma  exhibit b proposed project on hydrocarbon emission control cost analysis the air quality committee recommends mca engage an inde pendent contractor to conduct a study of the cost of control ling emissions to the unprecedented new low levels being planned by the environmental protection agency the committee further recommends the study requiring  months at a pro posed cost of  be assigned to foster d snell some member company timates place the new permanent in vestment cost at  billion to  billion for reducing an es timated  million tons per year of hydrocarbon emissions to the new levels annual operating and maintenance costs would be in draft epa guideline documents indicate estimates of control costs at much lower levels the critical nature of the contemplated reductions can be appreci ated from realizing that  lbsday may be the maximum allowed whereas  lbsday now are permitted in most circumstances the study has been designed to ascertain how much it will cost using reasonably available control technology ract to reach four levels of hourly emission rates and four levels of daily rate limits the study will yield data necessary to es tablish the relevant costbenefit correlations needed to define the crucial point of diminishing return and the cost effectiv ness of at least four basic ract methods data will be provided by mca member company plants analysis will be made by the contractor it is expected that about  individual member company plant responses will be obtained data will be encoded for confidentiality and to facilitate retrieval for analysis original data sheets will not be copied and will be returned to the originator after the study is complete infor mation will be gathered on emission characteristics flow volume composition concentration solubility etc by sources stacks vents reliefs etc according to plant location current levels of control the methods employed and the costs will be stated estimates of the cost of control will be compared against known situations to validate overall estimating procedures manufac turers will be interviewed on a selected basis for further cross comparison and to apply their knowledge of the most recent ract cma  f to avoid duplication of effort liaison will continue with other organizations such as the texas chemical council con cerned with similar studies there is little doubt as to epa direction epa considers nearly all hydrocarbons to be photochemical oxidant precursors regardless of their relative photolytic reactivity epa has advised  states to revise their state implementation plans sip and to ensure compliance with the clean air act of  pl  which does not allow new source permits in non attainment areas of the  air quality regions aqr  are classed nonattainment because of oxidant levels major pro jects are stopped in jeopardy or delayed because pl  does not permit new sources in nonattainment regions epa has also announced a goal of  reduction in hydrocarbon vapor losses from autos and light trucks currently there is no industry data for development of rational regulations or workable guidelines this study is in tended to define the cost parameters so that a costbenfit as sessment can be related to the results of varying levels of con trol and different strategies that could be employed to reach them acceptance of the project proposal is recommended concurs staff i it mca j i f f cma  i exhibit c proposed study on oxidant level control strategy anomalies when pl  clean air act amendments of  was enacted it was expected that national ambient air quality standards naaqs would be met nationwide by  or mid at the latest timely compliance has not been achieved for th criteria pollutants in many of the  air quality regions acr oxidant ozone levels are being exceeded in  regions nearly all of which encompass chemical industry concentrations prove their technical understanding for enforcing the naaqs epa studies in  focused on the contribution of urban ozone pre cursor emissions to ambient ozone concentrations and on the rel ative roles of local ozone formations and long range transport even though observed high ozone concentrations cannot be explained in terms of air flow from specific point sources or even from sin gle urbanindustrial sources epa now is acting to require com pliance with pl  reduction of hydrocarbon emissions from mobile and stationary sources will be required in spite of the fact that evidence exists showing that such will not necessarily prevent the occurrence of high ozone concentrations at any given site in order to provide data as to the effectiveness ofproposed hydrocarbon control strategies the air quality committee aqc r commends a study to assess the relationship between hydrocarbon levels from point sources and ozone levels the study needs to be undertaken now so that the results can be available prior to the adoption of hydrocarbon controls ex pected during the second quarter of  the study proposed to be conducted by the radian corporation will cost  twelve metropolitan areas would be analyzed selected as rep resentative of chemical industry concentrations eg houston and of nonchemical areas eg denver emission inventories for hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides will be obtained for recent years organized on a uniform basis and placed on magnetic tape for data reduction after certification of the basic validity of the data ambient air data will be obtained for comparable time periods and qualified to be certain that it is correct is rep cma  resentative and covers the same time period as the emission data correlations then will be drawn among high hourly ozone values their persistence annual average concentration of ozone and hydrocarbon emissions a special analysis will be made of unusual episodes and particular attention will be given to synoptic meteorological conditions associated with the unu sual episodes a report will be prepared describing the results and whether in retrospect current or proposed hydrocarbon con trol strategies would have worked to reduce ozone levels in the vicinity where control was imposed regional differences will be exposed the final report will include data describing regional var iations and characteristic patterns needed to help formulate local decisions as to the severity complexity and appropriate ness of the regional control strategies themselves this could be extended to define which hydrocarbon species need to be con trolled first or most whether drastic reductions in auto traffic will work in the particular area in question and what the con sequences of exceeding the standards by different amounts and varying frequencies would be based on what has happened before acceptance of the proposed study is recommended concurs staff mca bd cma  i exhibit h report to the board of directors manufacturing chemists association international trade committee october   in an effort to illustrate to you the relative importance of matters that are now pending pertaining to international trade  would like to quote from ambassador frederick dent of the office of special trade representative str the occasion was a plenary meeting in washington some two weeks ago for a group of industry sector advisory committees or isac ambassador pent told us that imports into this country in  are expect ed to be up  over those of  while exports will be up only  the expected trade deficit will be approximately o billion dollars imports of petroleum products in the usa  were valued at  billion dollars this year they are expected to reach  billion dollars gentlemen the need for industry support in the international trade area has never been as great as it is now today in the united states the cost of feedstock for the petrochemical in dustry is less than the corresponding cost in the common market ec but it is expected to be equal to that of the common market in about four years your international trade committee suggests that strong continued industry support on internation al trade is a must i am advised that the subject of trade did not appear in the top  items which certain mca member companies agreed to be those subjects of the greatest concern to them according to a recent survey however it does appear that we could have longrange problems in our economy unless international trade for our country increases to offset these deficits with this scenario in mind i would now like to give you an utline of what i hope to cover in the next  to  minutes first i plan to spend about  minutes on the status of the t negotiations the main part of my presentation to you  last about  minutes and this is devoted to the work t is going on in isac chemicals i would like to wind up with a brief comment concerning ocita office of chemical industry trade advisor  f cma  m  in regard to gatt i am aware that dr dawson has pretty much kept you up to date in this area the written report of these remarks that you will receive will give you the details of how the tariff formula which was first tabled by the usa dif fers from the one that the common market brought out injuly the tariff formula tabled by the u s suggests that all tariffs above  be cut by  the maximum allowed by the trade act and those below  by a formula of cuts between  the ec formula proposes tariffs would be cut by their own amount a process that would be repeated four times that is to say a tariff of  would initially be cut b  the result being a  tariff doing this four more times would mean an ultimate tariff of  the european version tends to embrace more harmonization in that it cuts the higher duties more than our formula does we remain critical of the ec proposal in that it specifically excludes agricultural products the common market still hopes to keep this delicate subject separate from other trade areas the international trade committee shares the feeling that the ec formula is not ambitious enough since it would result in an av rage reduction of the current duties of about  and that is before any exceptions are taken into account i understand that mr ford during his visit to the summit meeting in puerto rfco stated that the u s should shoot for a target cut of  of the current tariffs of our ec trading partners since mr ford was referring to a cut after exceptions are taken into account you can see this leaves a wide gap for our negotiators to close as to the timing of the final decision on the tariff formula you are aware that the swedes have recently settled their elec tions soon it will be the west germans and the japanese at the first of this coming year there will be a replacement of eight of the nine ec ministers in brussels all of this cou pled with our own elections in november leads your committee to the conclusion that not only will there be an agreement on the formula but also no serious negotiations will begin before early to mid at best cma  i  government continues however to let us know that things are indeed busy in geneva with various multilateral trade negotia tion mtn subgroups at work hammering out preliminary details these subgroups have been meeting with our trading partners in an effort to come to a mutual understanding on how to treat such matters as subsidies countervailing duties access to supply government procurement standards and codes gatt re form and the very important subject of nontariff barriers due to a wide variety of nontariff barriers currently employ ed it is thought by many that the settlement of this matter is more critical than the agreement upon a tariff formula isac six members of whom are from the mca international trade com mittee are providing u s chemical industry overviews on how we wish these matters to be handled when negotiations do finally take place this leads me into the subject of how isac is progressing at our meeting some two weeks ago in washington we were told by repr sentatives of the department of commerce as well as the office of special trade representative that isac was better prepared and better organized than any of the remaining  isacs this praise by the government is not meant to imply that we nec essarily expect to do better in the negotiations than we did in the kennedy round nor better than any of the other idustries of the united states but we do want you to know that we see no reason for government to eventually point the finger at our in dustry and tell us that we failed in doing our homework there still remains an inadequate twoway flow of information in these large and complex government private sector committee structures at the same time it is agreed that they are func tioning better than they were at the start str continues to tell us that they are determined to further improve the isac system and that the outcome of the negotiations will depend to a great extent on just how well we have prepared the geneva negotiators which in turn is saying just how well the isac functioned cma   due to the complexity of the chemical industry we were forced in isac to fragment into seven subcommittees which are benzenoid intermediates pigments fertilizers pesticides inorganics miscellaneous organics and dyestuffs the full isac committee is expected to meet four times this year while the subgroups will meet at least that many times at the pre sent time we are hard at work trying to determine just which chemical products would be most sensitive to tariff cuts this is the exceptions list there is one key area that i solicit the help of those of you present today in this respect and that is in the field of inorganic products more input into our committee is definitely required by industry to be sure that correct decisions by isac members are being made this input as it pertains to sensitivity should be made directly to the department of commerce and the appropriate address is given in the written report of these remarks industry consultation policy staff department of commerce washington d c  as isac works with this exceptions list and brings it to a conclusion we are informed by government that our next step will be one of being certain that we can ultimately provide the necessary justification for our decisions by utilization of a checklist we are preparing ourselves to address these questions from government we are also establishing priorities within the xceptions list itself thus the critical area for our indus try will probably reside in the rules for determining exception and the ultimate ability of our negotiators to obtain exceptions for the import sensitive products whether it is on a multilateral or bilateral basis in addition to this work on exceptions we continue to press government for the conversion of our specific and compound duties to an ad valorem basis the selection of the base year being the critical matter some base year has to be agreed upon in order to provide a starting point for the calculation of the value of the concessions to be negotiated this is more important for the chemical industry than perhaps any other due to the fact that we have such a large number of specific and compound duties and to the sharp rises in the chemical prices over the last several years cma  r finally i wish to report that dr dawson in the capacity of the chemical industry trade advisor has reactivated the technical advisory committee we will have our first meeting tomorrow in new york city dr dawson has restructured this committee and it is planned that this is yet another way that oar industry can be sure of addressing all agencies of our government with uniform voice in addition to mca dcma socma spx and various members of isac will all be brought together tomorrow under one committee this organization is not restrict ed as is the isac program in that twoway communication is pos sible one item that was not included in my outline that may be of in terest to you gentlemen deals with a recent survey sent to the chemical industry by the stanford research institute sri in conjunction with the u s department of labor due to the detail that the survey called for an overwhelming number of u sbased chemical companies have declined to respond in conclusion within the next  months there is a reasonable chance that our negotiators will begin a serious dialogue with there continues to be a serious need for continued industry input to insure we take advantage of all available opportunities having been in the position of chair man of this committee only about four months now i am happy to see dave dawson out there amongst you and he has agreed to help me answer any questions ourtrading partners thank you v cma  exhibit i report to the board of directors manufacturing chemists association e e christofano chairman occupational health committee october   since my last report to the board in february  rep resentatives of the occupational health committee testified on behalf of mca before the subcommittee on manpower and housing of the house of representatives committee on government operations at an oversight hearing on the occupational safety and health administration osha before the national academy of sciences committee on public information in the prevention of occupational cancer and met with dr morton corn the assistant secretary of labor an underlying theme of all three appearances was that r gulation of each and every chemical in the work environ ment under separate rules is unworkable instead it was urged that entire sectors of the chemical industry be covered by simple guidelines enforced by inspectors experienced in that special industry industries such as papermaking pesticide manufacture printing ink and petroleum refining were mentioned as examples where such regulation would be appropriate  recently the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh and osha have begun to prepare industry wide guidelines on pesticide manufacture and printing ink for mulation furthermore at a recent niosh workshop on regulation of pesticides in the workplace mr steven wodka legislative assistant for the oil chemical and atomic workers suggested an approach to worker health protection similar to the views expressed previously at the hearing and meetings just mentioned encouraged by the acceptance being gained for the idea of preparing regulations on an industrybyindustry basis the committee intends to further pursue its attempts at simplifying rules by working with the agencies involved the issue of identification of all chemicals including trade name products entering the workplace surfaced at the congressional oversight hearing mentioned earlier at that time the widespread practices among chemical manufacturers nre disclosed whereby products are identified only by trade name with inadequate instructions for safe handling on the i cma  label we predict that complete disclosure of the composition of trade name products will become a major effort by osha in the next year or two recently the committee sponsored the preparation of an article by dr w r gaffey a leading epidemiologist which provides guidance in how to collect health and employment data including exposure information that will be meaningful and adequate for future epidemiological studies to extend such studies across the entire petrochemical industry we hope to begin a joint mortality study soon with the american petroleum institute at this time the committee is beginning a feasibility study in conjunction with the american petroleum institute on the gathering and examination of mortality statistics among petrochemical workers since the committee believes that worker health experience will remain topical over the next several years it is also investigating a tumor registry among mca member companies to be maintained by a contractor it is expected that budget requests for these two activities will be firm by january  i cma  cma redaction documents volume      cma  and     cma board of directors meeting minutes cma concealed the report of its director of government relations  and  describing the important new laws passed at the end of the  second legislative session including the toxic substances control act pl  finally became the law after five years of deliberation and controversy thus establishing federal controls over the manufacturer distribution and use of chemicals cma  discussing bills which didnt pass but which were likely to surface again including a bill to provide stricter regulations of lobbying common cause is a strong advocate while nader groups and the aflcio supported only the house version cma concealed the apprehension of business that dues paid to trade associations by corporate members could be subject to public disclosure under some concepts cma concealed its discussion of the failure of the clean act amendments whose filibuster senator musky blamed on the auto industry the cma concealed its discussion of industrial organization the socalled hart bill who sponsors retirees and which singles out chemicals manufacturing and other industry for possible breakup creates a special commission to make divestiture investigations and a special court to compel dismantling cma  cma concealed its having reported the failure of bills which would have provided for the outlawing of corporate bribes to foreign officials and proposals to create a new consumer protection agency expand the ftc cma concealed its description of jimmy carter as an anti establishment candidate for nearly two years but that jimmy carter now is the establishment cma  the cma concealed its statement that carter is now confronted with the dilemma of some delicacy how to begin to direct and to motivate the people and the mechanisms he as so recently and soundly castigated cma  the cma concealed its discussion of congressional leaders who have obviously enjoyed the independence and status which the years of confrontation during the stalemate government of presidents nixon and ford have produced cma   these legislatures simply covet their independence of action and consider their important role as being nothing more than punishing one president or making his successor appear ineffectual longtime carter watchers point out that he adopted a tough no compromise attitude towards the georgia legislature during his term as qwp mollie governor cma  cma concealed its belief that the incoming presidentwould apparently retain the present nondegradation concepts of the clean air act and has called for stricter enforcement of water pollution control laws and evidently will oppose efforts to weaken federal water pollution control act cma  cma concealed the report of its chemical packaging committee and its existence cma  times have changed just a few years ago chemical packaging engineers might be concentrating on the steel thickness of a drum for solvents etc but today he must also know about the transportation safety act of  consolidation of dot regulations and looking to the future regulations on solid waste deposal and carcinogens and why have times changed so we believe the most important factor is the concern on the part of both private and public sectors for greater safety in the packaging transportation and distribution of hazardous materials cma concealed its discussion of dot recognition of costbenefit it considers in any reviews of package regulation changes packaging is seen as a cost item in our industry cma  the cma concealed the fact its packaging committee together with the transportation equipment and transportation and distribution committees sponsors symposium on hazardous materials regulations with over  attendees from all concerned shipper and carriers groups other evidence indicates the cmas preference for regulation by dot cma concealed dot has already indicated that they have underdevelopment regulations applying to the proper packaging and transportation of health products such as carcinogens munegions and teartatogens cma  cma concealed its chemical packaging committees reference to its responsibilityto assist the chemical industry to meet all legal requirements while maintaining a lowrisk position in transportation with proper costbenefit consideration and we intend to make known the position or industry on legislative and regulatory matters cma  consistent with its systematic redaction of similar reports which cma despite repeated orders of the court thinks it has a right to redact as nonresponsive or unlikely to lead to the discovery of relevant evidence here again cma conceals the public relations committees report to the board of directors indeed the very existence of the public relations committee was systematically concealed by cma in its first three document production plaintiffs allege that the scientific efforts conducted by the cma were adjuncts to its overall public relations efforts cma redacted as irrelevant its goal for its previous year one of two qwp mollie that we should establish closer relationships with other functional areas of cma so a more meaningful contribution to the industry total communications could be made these things have been done the assaults on the chemical industry by media and government in the past twelve months have made it imperative cma  there is a reference to the activities of that committee chemical regulations advisory committee crac an opportunity to participate in dr heckerts special committee on toxic legislation which cma says demonstrated what can be accomplished through interaction of functions when proper leadership is provided i dont know what this means exactly though we do know that the beginning of this committee whose existence concealed by cma began about eighteen months ago and this would have been around the time of the tennecospi jurisdictional dispute of the spring of  it was about eighteen months ago that the public relation committee stepped up its practice of meeting with the leadership of certain other functional committees particularly government relations technical and legal advisory the technical group would have included the vinyl panel and the link with the vinyl panel and it begins with tenneco who shared the spis similar committee the plaintiffs allege that the cmas scientific and public relations activities are intertwined and cma has redacted this statement as proof that joint committee action can get things done what we have found is that we can work together  that we have a common purpose and pursuit we have agreed upon issues that should the greatest concern of the association referring to the cma generally and the joint committees such as those discussed here these are human health and the environment and the increasing government constraints which he wrote industry management of its resources cma concealed specific references to liaisons between its public relations committee and its air quality committee its occupational health committee its government relations committee as well as its legal advisory and chemical relations advisory committee cma  cma concealed that the air quality committee for example will provide facts on what the chemical industry has done about air pollution and provide the industry position on current legislative and regulatory matters in active collaboration with the public relations committee this document spells out that members of the technical task force which service coordinators of the public relations project recruit the best possible spokesman from mcas membership and arrange platforms in leading cities where maximum speaker in accordance with this plan for joint committee action with the public relations committee would develop his topic in his own way weaving in the mcadeveloped material at will the type of spokesman we have in mind are you gentlemen the directors of mca supported by other chief executive officers not present today cma  qwp mollie the cma concealed its discussion of the advantages of its plan to interject the public relations committee into actively resolve with other committees the short range advantage is obviousto gain some badly needed statements of the chemical industry point of view and various media the longer range advantage will be gained as we found as we build up this corps of spokesman mca has a constant need for industry experts who can provide statements and can make appearances on relevantly short notice for the industry to provide news media with the other sides position when the story relating to say air quality etc is breaking the cma concealed its goal as to provide al carte experts to furnish the other sides position anytime there is a whole sordid story to tell which the chemical industry needs to come up with the other side with the assistance of the cmas public relations committee cma  cma concealed that its leading environmental journal chemecology was in fact the creature of the cmas public relations committee whose express purpose was to expand further its coverage of member companies success stories in the areas of environment and toxic substances cma  cma concealed its threetimesayear chemical issues and commentary which is described as a survey of member companies by the cmas public relations committee in order to identify emerging issues and which practice goes back to  when we began polling people participating in mca activities in six companies and the professional staff of mca but which has now grown to nineteen companies and mca with over  respondents mca has consistently concealed all references to and any documents generated as the result of the surveys it is not believable such surveys especially in the  era would not contain responsive information consistent with its systematic practice cma concealed the cma staff report which includes a report from the chairman of its occupational health committee that the director of osha had recently told him osha would welcome industry input early in the development of any proposed standard information desired includes toxicological work place exposure data on chemicals to be regulated which would become part of the pertinent record cma  which references to cma sponsored tsca seminars its sponsorship of a symposium entitled the approaching toxic era in houston november th cma  mca made public additional toxicological data relating to the safety of acrylonitrile monitor on november th as a result of feeding liquid acrylonitrile to pregnant rats qwp mollie in a case in which plaintiffs have put the cmas activities regard sd front and center cma has redacted relevant references to its having suspended circulation of eight chemical safety data sheets pending their revision to incorporate present knowledge regarding property characteristics and handling and its promise to reissue them someday during this time and years to come the cma continue to sit on sd despite its promise revision as early as    cma  and   cma board of directors meeting minutes again cma concealed the agenda for its meeting including both irrelevant and relevant matter pertaining to its chemical relations advisory committee crac its industrial relations advisory committee iraq and its legal advisory committee in fact although cma has produced at least three prior versions of the document found at cma  and after stipulating that these minutes werent confidential years ago and after never having previously asserted any claim or privilege whatsoever with the regard to this document and after having been ordered unequivocally to produce this document in its entirety at the very latest by the time of the last case master meeting cma has redacted a portion of a page two pages behind it cma  as privileged only by reference to the previously concealed agenda is it possible to even guess this material probably relates to the legal advisory committee portion of the board of directors report cma was ordered to produce in its entirety months if not years ago the cma concealed its discussion of corporate government regulationseffect on innovation and the express desire without questioning governmental regulation per say to impose the least possible burden in accomplishing reasonable objections cma considered soliciting industrywide documentation of this propertied phenomena this adverse effect on innovation phenomena in the interest of being persuasive and the board of director mr krumrei was to summit a memorandum on the subject to the executive committee cma  as usual cma concealed all the information on its financial position including information that will allow one to see the total amount spent on cmas entire technical panel was a mere  less than what it spent on public and government relations combined and that its final chloride research received only a small small fraction of its funds cma further concealed the existence of the plastic scoop or its financial package cma  cma concealed its survey of member companies to obtain sound data on chemical manufacturing industry operating costs and investment qwp mollie relating to environmental management which it said was similar to that used in  and enabled direct comparisons with similar information obtained in surveys conducted in    and  such data has provided mca with factual information useful in the growing public debate over costsbenefits cma  cma concealed the report of its food drug and cosmetic chemicals committee cma   discussing the us supreme court decision and usv park holding that a corporate executive could be prosecuted under the criminal provisions of the food drug and cosmetic act for product adulteration irrespective of his personal ignorance of the situation causing the adulteration and however remote his involvement in that situation which it describes as imposing absolute criminal liability based merely upon the responsibility of the individual corporate officers for certain areas of activity cma  cma concealed the report from its industrial advisory committee that industry might expect increased future activity in areas relating to occupational safety and equal employment opportunity whether you have unions or not your employees are becoming aware of their rights in these areas if you have unions many are building technical staffs in the safety hygiene and health fields the way their locals have auditing the safety of our work places several companies in our industry have experienced employee health crisis in the last year with resulting employee and public relations problems we must be prepared to devote more management time and resources to avoid further employee anxieties about the safety of their work under the best of circumstances those of us with unions can expect to hear more about health and safety in future negotiations unions are impatient with osha indeed the oil chemical and atomic workers is suing osha we should expect that this impatient will result in a more direct approach with employers including demands for safety committees with authority of union safety consultants at our plants and hire visibility for such unionoriented medical consultants such as dr irving selicoff cma  cma concealed its characterization of osha at the time morton corn took office the perception of osha by the public government and industry at the time was highly unflattering morton corn has not yet succeeded in reversing that view but is determined to do so in short morton corn is making osha a new and different kind of organization which is describes as being on a more professional level and certain period cma  cma concealed its contact with the ilo international labor organization through the international chemicals employers labor relations qwp mollie committee which is in effect with need the caucus for ilo purposes of chemical employers throughout the world this demonstrates the close lesion between cma and its european counterparts cma concealed its problematical concern as to whether the us will remain in the ilo at all anymore it reports that the chamber of commerce which represents us management in the ilo has taken the position that so long as we are members we should be fully active particularly in seeking needed reforms this appears to be proper position for mca to maintain cma concealed cracs solicitation of thirtyfive trade organizations requesting that mca presumes the role of coordinator in communicating with the epa in respect of regulations implanting the tsca cma  cma apparently deleted exhibit f  in its entirety which consisted of the report of the cma legal advisory committee cma   cma  and   cma board of directors meeting minutes cma concealed its establishment of a toxic substances contact responsible for receiving from crac specifically a document of a type cma systematically concealed entitled toxic substances management memo cma  cma concealed its proposed program on the osha regulation of benzene cma  and its position on the toxic substances control act cma  which includes references to the cmas consolidation organization of other available data for presentation to osha which is meant to apply primarily to epidemiology studies carried out in various companies but not publicized from a concern that they did not represent a large enough base adding them together may provide a more convincing picture again it was felt that outside expertise should be sought to consolidate the information cma  this study turns out to have been conducted by otto wong and eha or ncnsr if i not mistaken this indicates the reanalysis of the existing studies was the goal from the outset cma concealed its boasting over the success of its crac and influencing epa policy including epas dropping its proposal that impurities acceptance be reported with annual production volumes cma  as usual cma concealed the report of its government relations committee which includes a hilarious recollection of how easy cma used to keep bills off the senate floor or by just leaving town to tend to my cows when pressure got too great im not saying this was the way to run the qwp mollie government but it was the time when businessmen had more influence in congress than they have today but that day went out with one man one vote drive that took place more than a decade ago the civil rights movement and for a variety of other reasons cma also redacted its bias recollection of the history of the evolution of union influence the influence of television on selecting and influencing members of congress as well as the rise of public interests groups  including the washington offices of several large companies following world war ii in the last two decades trade associations have become as much of washington growth phenomena as government itself cma  cma redacted its complaints that it lacksgrass roots voice and that many congress members are telling cma that opinions from the corporate board room no longer carry the weight they once did and the vernacular of capital hill they ask us how many votes have you got the speaker analogizes the tally on election day to the corporate managers bottomline on your corporate financial statement what cma concealed by concealing the origins of its grass roots voice on capital hill is that it marshaled two resources that presently are largely untapped by businessemployees and stock holders who should receive an understanding of the kind of governmental climate that exists for preservation of private enterprise and an understanding of how that personal welfare relates to that of a corporation ect cma   this contemplates the mobilization of employees and stockholders of cma members cma  cma concealed the activities of its labels and precautionary information committee  including its discussion of coordination of efforts with the cia of britain testimony before a congressional subcommittee with oversight responsibilities for osha with resulting opportunity to influence congressional thinking and wrestling with the problem of labeling for current chronic hazards problems involving carcinogenicity comutinicity teragencity hepatoxicicity and the difficult interface between suspected carcinogencity and test animals versus proven carcinogencity and the appointment of a subcommittee including members of at least three defendants to prepare recommendations in this critical area the activities of this committee were systematically concealed by cma cma concealed its publication by the same dr gaffe who is the epidemiologist who originally studied the vinyl industry and who subsequently the vinyl chloride research coordinators regulatory agencies often use the findings of the epidemiology studies when they make decisions and issue guidelines the kinds of epidemiology studies however as well as the data they require in their scope of usefulness are sometimes not well understood on recommendation of the occupational health committee therefore mca engaged dr r gaffe to write an explanatory article in technical language on occupational epidemiology which had been printed as qwp mollie a fourpage booklet entitled a brief overview of occupational epidemiology dr gaffe was with equitable environmental health inc when engaged to write the article but is now at standford research institute cma  cma subsequently other references to this paper  cma  and   cma board of directors meeting minutes cma concealed its board of directors resolution on public interests law firms cma  and  which expressly endorses the national legal center for the public interest which it says is dedicated to traditional concepts of private property and competition merit accuracy these firms were formed as a direct result public interest law firms such ralph nader possessive public citizen litigation groups national resources defense council and searra club legal defense fund employing  full time lawyers with budgets exceeding  a year the specific legal foundation slf was established in  in sacramento ca to counteract the activities of the above firms by supporting the free enterprise system and traditional concepts of private property and competition it has had many successes the national legal center for the public interest was established in washington dc in  with four principle objections  to help establish independent regional legal foundations dedicated to a balanced view of the role of law in achieving economic and social progress ie again it  to research national legal issues from a litigation point of view and develop strategies to achieve the foundations  objectives  to act as a resource center regional litigation foundations in obtaining qualified researchers and experts and  to identify legislative administrative and juridical trends likely to result in future litigation under the auspices of the mlccpi many other regional foundations have been organized patterned after the fourrunner plf these foundations will support in the courts the tenets of free enterprise which nobody else appears to be doing in the area of public interest law cma concealed the legal advisory committees endorsement of the activities of these organizations and adopted an attached resolution of endorsement cma who cant seem to find the secrecy agreements its solicited and other relevant documents concealed the existence of its technical information retrieval committee with gulf oil chemicals corporation as vice chairman cma  cma concealed its staff report concerning mca testimony before the national advisory committee on occupational safety and health nacosh qwp mollie on regulations on worker exposure to suspected chemical carcinogens proposed by osha with areas of particular concern including for one osha is considering only inherent toxic properties and ignoring dosage duration and time of exposure in interaction with other substances and urging nacosh to deliberate at great length over a definition of a the cma concealed its go slow approach to fda regulations for good laboratory practices cma  the continuous mechanism of the technical publications program has resulted in the recent suspension from circulation of five chemical safety data sheets on trychloride ethyline perchlorine ethyline dimethyl sulfate acrylontrile and napthalene since the first notification of suspensions in november  and that its chemical safety data sheets on arsenic tryoxide chlorine morihydride zirconium and afnium powder have been withdrawn permanently the cma concealed its seminar on corporate readiness for compliance with tosca attended by approximately  cma    cma  and   mca board of directors meeting minutes cma concealed existence and activities of its various committees including its air quality committee its government relations committees and its political action committee dr barnes spoke of his companys experience relating to   of their employees participating in seven political action committees distributed regionally around the country he expressed the opinion that this had been successful effort in support of the free enterprise system and offered to furnish others with information on dows approach to pacs cma  cma concealed the report of its air quality committee including the observation that we are on strong technical ground in saying that oxidant is relatively insensitive to changes in hydrocarbons and that hydrocarbons can not be controlled sufficiently in most places to obtain the oxidants standard los angeles is a prime example mca concealed that it had been most active in testifying writing and visiting congressmen and meeting with their staffs to seek all the amendments proposed in mr polzers testimony cma  the cma concealed its discussion of the epa study of synthetic organic chemical industry and cmas coordination with socma with regard to a total of about forty chemicals epa states that synthetic organic chemicals contributed  of the total hydrocarbon emissions from stationary sources they state that control hinges primarily on proper plant qwpmollie design in operation that will require depth of knowledge by epa of our operations that is unprecedented cma concealed its discussion of strong criticism against epa by the edf that benzene was a significant hazard and carcinogen resulting in the emergency which resulted in the development of a special mca task group to handle this item alone however since this is a single product response to epa is being made on an individual company basis as if mca were not coordinating the violation of the antitrustl eleven mca member companies are participating cma  the cma concealed the existence of the foster d snell inc hydrocarbon control cost study and resulting questionnaire it was funding weve never attempted anything to this depth before but then weve never faced  billion investment costs for control of a single class of pollution before he says the study was an eyeopener and will show we discharge a greater tonnage of hydrocarbon than we thought that we do not have a good estimate on emissions on a number of sources that likely the majority of our total poundage emissions derive from only a fraction of our total sources the cma has determined that information such as this is not likely to lead to discoverable evidence in this case indicating a willful ignorance of plaintiffs pleadings and discovery cma  cma conceals the was its air quality committee orders up a scientific committee requiring medical epidemiology input as if it were a peca epa is revising the six existing air qualities standards and will be adding new ones our committee will need medical epidemiology input if we are to react unless you object my intention of a nucleus medical of representation from your companies to determine the feasibility of a rebuttal a second item needing medical input is an advice on the concentrations of the community environment that are considered safe for all of our chemicals the current procedure is to use the osha standards and arbitrarily take a percentage of them and call this safe for the public we will have to do better than this for benzene achrylinitride and eventually all the rest we would plan to use your a forementioned medical representatives to guide committees in this crucial area also the third item is that relatively little attention has been paid by control agencies to our emissions during startup and shutdowns emergency releases and fugitive losses various estimates indicate that they may be as large as our normal emissions and control agencies are starting to note this cma  this is relevant and should not have been concealed compare cma  with say  the redacted material makes sense and the material cma chose to produce in the context it shows to produce it only created more questions than it answered qwpmollie plaintiffs do not point to this as a particularly egregious deletion on the other hand it is as good as an example as any of the cmas abuse of its right to redact relevant information cma concealed the reference to the board adding a general council to the mca staff despite the strength of the present staff support we welcome this and being pushy hope the time will come when the environmental lawyer is also hired cma  in a similar vein cma concealed its water resources committees references to the quality of the legal services to environmental committees in which the committee wished to point out that for some time the water resources committee has been concerned about the uncertainty and irregularity of the legal council it received in the course of its business it is particularly important that an attorney familiar with environmental law review comments that are prepared by an epa technical committee for submittal to cma in response to regulatory proposals are in discussion of epas program strategies several years ago in an attempt to provide such service the mca board authorized the establishment of the joint subcommittee of the environment law jsel however other demand member companies attorneys time this does not resolve the problem cma  cma concealed the concern of its water resources committee with a level of funding for its scientific studies they are practically begging for  cma concealed its description of the epa administrator russell train as having a strong environmentalist leaning which affected agency policy although in rein by the recognition of economic realities by others in the ford and nixon administrations we fear that there may not be an equal restraining influence on president carter cma  cma concealed its staffs reports boasting of the conspicuous role it played in responding to epas strategy document assessment and control of chemical problems at public meetings attended by  participants nearly all representatives of industry in washington on march  cma  cma concealed that mca has emphasized again the chemical longstanding position that some provisions of the clean air act of  are rapidly leading our nation to untimely and overly restrictive limitations on industrial strength and george polzer again presented the association views before a congressional unit this time on march th to members of the subcommittee of environment on the health state and foreign commerce committee cma considering amendments to the clean air act of  george polzer has presented testimony before the senate in february who is this george polzer who has presented the associations views on the amendments to the caa of  cma  qwp mollie mca expressed concernthat naming certain contaminants in the bill effectively judges the need for controls and that all elements of doubt will be resolved in favor of control whether or not hearings and studies demonstrate an affirmative need for them cma  cma endorsed the tasa language will not cause or significantly contribute an unreasonable risk to public health regarding zero risks and risksbenefit cma says it is less than th of the problem caused by hydrocarbon emissions as opposed to motor vehicles and fuel marketing two percent additional investment by  would not be intolerable cma doesnt support the rooney amendment which place primarily responsibility on the state for granting variances for expansion or new construction in areas where the national standard is being exceeded because mca felt the amendment could be interpreted as requiring trade offs cma  cma announced on april th supplementing it  testimony before the nac on osha mca said the chemical industry is dedicated to protecting its workers from known hazards on the other hand we held that occupational cancer is not the major public health spectre some have suggested cancer is a complex subject we pointed out qualified experts see the subject in perspective and through perspective we believe the problem and its reduction can be addressed cma wants a committee of cancer experts to study the available facts and scientificmedical guidelines for use by osha in this area composed from academia industry labor toxicology groups and government cma opposed generally applicable regulations and wants its panel of qualified experts each chemical must be addressed on a casebycase the third thing the cma recommended that osha include in a new proposal for guidelines regulating carcinogens in the work place was the use of performance rather than specific routes to desired performance ie if performance standards cma  mcas support for oshas abc plan for work place safety which would use incentives on grade b companies and concentrate their enforcement efforts on grade a companies consisting of those found to have ineffective programs cma  qwp mollie   cma  and   mca board of directors meeting minutes last time cma concealed is used unless i specifically say it cma concealed tasa implantation richard e heckert the senior advisor to the executive committee on tasa heckert was to meet with era administrator costle to discuss the tendency to overregulate as well as to emphasize the limited availability of testing facilities to conduct toxicological evaluation cma  cma concealed their report of their director on government relations cma  and  heated battlestook place in both house and senate over rules which will apply to the expansion of industrial facilities in areas where air quality does not meet national health standards cma refers to its effort to set aside the epa trade off policy a broadly supported business effortmounted in both committees of the house and senate which were considering those rules cma  concern was expressed by subcommittee members senate commerce subcommittee on science that costle has not requested sufficient funding to properly administer the law in his request to the appropriation authorizations on epa  million for  and  million for  prior to having left his position in the epa the previous epa administrator tran has asked for  million for  instead of  million cma discusses the proposed amendment to tsca to establish toxic substances injury assistance act whose sponsor senator griffin feels that the federal and state levels of governments should respond to chemical contamination as much as they do in cases of natural disasters however costle in the environmental organization supported a concept of involving funds contributed by the manufacturers cma does not say whether it opposed or supported this legislature cma  the insurance committee reported to the board that to put it simply the liability market is in a state of utter chaos cma suggests giving serious consideration to assuming more of the risks coupled with inhouse risk management discipline procedures to control losses the name of the game continues to be loss prevention cma  the chairman of the insurance committee says he is hopeful that cma will be able to influence legislature to the benefit of the chemical industry with regard to product liability legislative reform activities cma  qwp mollie the cma refers to its finalization of a loss data bank which the insurance committee has been creating for the last five years and which contain statistics and pertinent information on property losses under stewardship of mca to provide uniformity of reporting in confidentiality cma concealed its staff report including the reference to its principle concern improved definition and interpretation of air quality standards limits on industrious expansion in areas failing to obtain health standards no growth implications of federallyenforced policy of nondeterioration and relief from certain flexible statutory compliance deadlines the bentsen amendment would allow exceptions in nonattainment areas under certain conditions cma  the cma learns that osha has announced a one ppm ets down  eighthour twa lowering the ceiling from  to  ppm eliminating the peak level of  ppm for a   minute period during the eighthour day under the prior standard cma  dr bingham promised work on developing a permanent standard which would be complete in six months cma  cma concealed that it arranged  television interviews and  radios interviews with  member companies representatives at this american women in radio and television convention and interviewed ten industry representatives and sent  copies of these interviewsto extension home economists around the country for use on their local radio  ninetythree percent of the  people attending the american women in radio and television convention visited mcas suiteconvention attendees in our suite was the most popular of all cma  cma concealed its discussion of suggestion made some months ago that consideration be given to merging socma society of organics chemicals manufacturer association identified in plaintiffs discovery into mca this matter having been studied jointly by the mca executive committee and socma board a merger has been abandoned for the present instead closer liaisons is to be maintained through crossvisitation meetings of the official bodies of the two

water pollution control and toxic cma again concealed any reference to its environmental management survey here in fact the response to the request for the survey information qwp mohie has been disappointing with only  companies submitting data which compared to   in a similar survey two years ago in which survey results have also been concealed cma  cma concealed its discussion of osha cancer policy proposal and mcas having written the nas on osh urging the establishment of a review committee of cancer experts from academia government labor toxicology and industry groups   cma  and   mca board of directors meeting minutes cma concealed the meeting schedule of its board of directors of  which refers to meetings every month except july and august with all meetings taking place in washington dc except three in exotic locations cma  cma concealed its liaison with socma and the fact that the ep blanchard the president of socma was in attendance in the meeting and that the cmas george f polzer reported on his attendance at recent socma board meetings and having responded enthusiastically saying that closer liaisons should identify opportunities for complimentary action and that he would be pleased to continue to represent mca and fostering this relationship cma  cma concealed the fact that virtually all its nonbudgeted funds and meetings involved vinyl chloride or other chlorinated hydrocarbon research with a few exceptions like phosgene fluorocarbons and benzene cma  the second version july  or cma  mca moved to intervene in the apis suit requesting review of oshas ets for benzene issued april th cma   cma  and  mca board of directors meeting minutes cma concealed its policy on lobbying reform cma  and  which would require substantial changes in reporting record keeping and disclosures in funding sources in such a manner as to raise serious questions for trade associations and their members cma  the cma wants to make sure that any new legislature at least it is limited to congress and not to the executive branch or grassroots lobbying activities and specifically that it not require the compulsory disclosure of trade association membership and dues information cma  of course cma would budget huge amounts of money to various public relations and scientific efforts as well as direct lobbying activities qwpmollie cma concealed the existence of its chemical regulation advisory committee industrial relations advisory committee insurance committee and public relations committee cma  this is not an isolated incident the cma consistently concealed every reference to these committees and their activities throughout the documents it produced in this case the cma concealed the report of its government relations committee cma  including its reference to proposed labor reform bills lobbying reform bills which could sharply affect the business community emphasis in the original cma concealed its alliance with the nam and the united states chamber of commerce in rallying to seek enactment of legislation which would correct the inadequacies of the present lobbying laws without placing the reasonable constraints and burdensome requirements on organizations and individuals wishing to communicate with members of congress the the cma concealed the fact that the president here william j driver of the cma may himself approve studies which are conducted under the subscribed special projects program being administrated by mca here no vcm related project was discussed although an edc project is discussed however because of the systematic manner cma redacted relevant information which would allow a reader to understand the context of unredacted information unless i read cma  or any similar staff report they all were redacted of the information which reveals this relevant information as to how special projects program such as the mca administered vinyl projects operate specifically the vinyl panel the cma concealed its presidents report of cmas refinement of its views on confidentiality as this issue is involved in section  of tasa and its reference to a task force composed of members of the chemical regulations advisory and technical information retrieval committees which would address the confidentiality issues including simply using total volume of production as acceptable method of inventory reporting etc cma concealed its having told the epa considering inadequate methodology used to develop the preliminary list that will be used to develop the first priority list of fifty substances to be scrutinized under the toxic substance control act etc cma  qwpmollie  cma   mca board of directors meeting minutes dr ula bingham will address the next mca chemical forum  and cma recognized that osh a activities are of a continuing interest to the chemical industry and dr binghams appearance especially timely in view of oshas recently proposed generic standards for carcinogencity publishing of the federal registry on october h cma  cma concealed the staff report of its president cma  cma concealed its submission of a long document to osha on  stating that there is no substantial evidence of record to support the proposed conclusion that the health and safety of employees will be enhanced by changing the standard from  ppmppm to ppmppm and if there is no evidence that leukemia has resulted from exposure to benzene at the current concentration limits with the regulations described as representing an intolerable misallocation of economic resources which would not improve safety in the work place but would merely elevate a declaration of policy to a position superior to a scientific evidence which congress has determined to be the primary basis for the formulation of the cma concealed mcas having protested to the environmental protection agency the efforts to limit the emissions of vinyl chloride even further are unreasonable and refers specifically to a letter written by driver also not produced to my knowledge to epa on  stating that member companies have grave concerns about epas zero riskszero emission approach to regulation seeing it as an apparent departure from the intent of congress for reasonably acting on the clean act amendments of  and further that there is no compelling evidence to act now cma who defeated jurisdiction in the vinyl chloride conspiracy case a few years later reports that more than   people took part in mcas annual workshop on safety and health in the chemical industry in new orleans last month cma  cma also concealed that dr bingham assistant secretary for occupational safety and health department of labor would speak at the chemical forum on  at washington hilton cma  qwpmollie  cma  and   cma board of directors meeting minutes cma concealed the participation of socma ep blanchard el du cma concealed the proposed rules of organization and procedure for the chemical regulations advisory committee crac cma  although cma agreed that these minutes were not confidential years ago it continues to defy the courts orders not to redact irrelevant information from responsive documents here a large section of the discussion of the technical and functional committee reports it received and which are not attached and which cma has not produced anyway including technical committees on such matters as air quality chemical packaging education activities government relations insurance labels and precautionary information etc cma  cma concealed its discussion of its risksbenefit analysis which highlighted carcinogencity as the crucial current problem relating to riskbenefit analysis with resolution of the threshold concept being vital for understanding cma  cma concealed the fact that what later came to be known as the american industrial health council aihc began its existence as an inter industry task group for a rational cancer policy and that the chairman of this committee was on the cma board of directors cma  the purpose of aihc is to bring rationality to osh a regulations concerning cancer the activities of the aihc are specifically identified as being the result of a joint effort with mca socma and other trade associations as well as numerous individual companies and various industries participating socma provided staff support and the firm cleary gottliebe steen apersand and hamilton have been retained as legal council the cma concealed the cooperative and constructive relationship with osha he stressed this following his discussion of a visit he made to osha administrator dr ula bingham cma  the aihc was charged to develop a list of suspected commercial carcinogens as well as information that will assist a company to assess the impact of regulatory action on its own operations and information that will help companies to prepare to testify cma  cma concealed the report its board of directors received from  member companies responding to surveys which indicate product liability to be a problem in respect to chemical manufacturing but was not shown qwp mollie to be a major one as it is the case for machinery manufacturers or those engaged in supplying consumer products emphasis supplying cma  the committee is reserving judgment on workmens compensation law as the sole remedy since that surely would be very expensive cma  cma concealed that its board of directors received reports from cut chemical industry institute of toxicology here represented by mr fleming its chairman who introduced dr goldberg ciits president who spoke of the institutes objectives and progress in toxicological testing of widely distributed basic chemicals research and test methods in interpretation of data and training of toxicologists and that all this toxicology testing was being supported by  companies with a threeyear commitment  totaling  million dollars and building a staff of  cma  plaintiffs discovery the various court orders and plaintiffs subpoena clearly and specifically requested information with regard to contacts between cma and cut cma concealed that except for a wellbudgeted industry wide benzene study the entire budget for cma research relates to vinyl or plastics bcm vdc styrine acryiloniterile trichlorethylene edc chlorbenzne epichilorohydrin phthalate esters epoxy resins and titanium dioxide cma  cmas original production and cma  cma also concealed the entire plastics group financial package cma concealed the rules of organization and procedure of crac cma  which coordinated the activities of various cma panels cma knew plaintiffs knew about however cma knew plaintiffs did not know about the chemical relations advisory committee of the cma crac whose stated purposes included advising the board concerning the testing and regulatory control of chemicals at the point of manufacturer identified with potential hazards to health and the environment and to formulate and advocate chemical industry positions cooperate with other mca committees and promote exchange of information within the chemical industry with trade and professional associations and with all levels of government regarding good practices in controlling chemical hazards cma  cma concealed that membership in this committee was limited to candidates whose duties for his employer include formulation of policies qwp mollie and direction of programs related to toxic substances control through research quality control product development occupational environmental safety or allied function cma  cma concealed the existence of the general principles applicable to the structure and operations of committee which prescribes the responsibilities of the secretary the mca staff representative assigned to each cma committee cma  cma still has not produced this general principles document and in fact systematically concealed the existence of the organizational structure in which the pertinent cma activities occurred the original date of this document appears to have been march   with subsequent amendments cma  cma concealed the report of its government relations committee cma  including discussions of tsca amendments with mca activity in this area under way in the legal advisory subgroup of crac and that crac intends to prepare a position paper for use on the hill cma concealed the existence of its washington environmental coordinating committee here being informed of problems of crac with proposed tsca amendments cma  cma concealed its staff report cma  including its expectation that osha would issue its permanent standard sometime between thanksgiving and middle of december for benzene and its awareness that epa regulating benzene under section  of the air quality control act and that it had issued three documents on ambient air distribution of emissions and risks to human health cma  cma concealed its agreements with the franklin institute research laboratories firl to provide mca information necessary for updating safety data sheets and determining whether in a particular instance for example sd which despite industry pledge to reissue in  wouldnt see the light of day for years if it ever did a safety data sheet would be temporarily withdrawn from distribution pending revision cma  the cma recognizes that there is only approximately  chemicals we have published a safety data sheet to begin with cma  cma concealed the existence of plastics waste management it first describes as having been published in   and the existence of flammability testing of polymers whose date is not given cma  cma concealed very relevant information pertaining to its knowledge and understanding of notification of substantial risks under section  e of tsca this is directly relevant to the buse audit of ibt discussed at the qwp mollie emergency session of the vcrc in  where ed frost discussed cma lawyers having gone through the files of cma following discussion of document which might sink the cma cmas position as the concealed portion reveals it expressed to epa was that section  e of tsca will cause inefficient over reporting  of information to the agency and cause serious internal difficulties for the chemical industry which unlike the ridiculous prediction of inefficient over reporting actually may have occurred since fraudulent under reporting under tsca did in fact create serious internal difficulties for the chemical industry which at least in the vinyl was resolved internally through knowing violation of tsca ad  e provisions as only a small part of its internal difficulties in complying with the law or any requirement that it reported significant or true information with regard to toxicity to anyone cma   cma  and   mca board of directors meeting minutes cma concealed its introduction of mr frost who joined the associations staff as general council on january   other information indicates he was or became a vicepresident as well the activities of mr frost were relevant to this litigation and cma knew it long before it started producing documents cma concealed the board of directors consideration of public attitude toward the chemical industry in which a consultant discussed findings of a deteriorated public attitude toward chemicals and chemical manufacturers which he related principally to concerns about health cma  cma concealed both the existence and the activities of its special committee on product liability and continues to remain in contempt the courts order that it produce unredacted copies of these documents the same survey of mca members which showed product liability was not a problem for the chemical industry was also concealed in previous documents eg board minutes  at cma  here cma continues to conceal information in these minutes which they stipulated were not confidential years ago redacting even in its most recent production information on the grounds that portions of the information in these admittedly nonconfidential documents are somehow privileged which by the way inconsistent with every previous ruling of the court addressing minutes not one privilege claim with regard to meeting minutes has been upheld and cmas continued redacted of these documents can only be considered in direct contempt of the courts prior orders cma  consistent with its prior pattern cma concealed that it using commitments from  companies was bankrolling the aihc to the tune  just leading up to the osha proposal for generic regulation of qwp mollie carcinogens cma  mr berker urged all testimony of the hearings in the belief that it will add significally to the impact of written statements cma has still not produced relevant reports from its technical and functional committees cma  which were distributed in advance with the tentative agenda which unlike many others of the most recent versions of the minutes september  is not preceded by a copy of the agenda see for example the agenda for the previous board meeting for  cma  whereas much relevant information has been found in the reports of the technical and functional committees including some of these such as government relations committee industrial relations advisory committee legal advisory committee and even the occupational health committee the absence of these reports corresponds with their distribution along with the agenda there is no reason that they shouldnt have been produced here as well just because they were sent in advance of the meeting instead of distributed at the meeting in fact they are incorporated into the minutes in the exactly the same way they are when the reports are attached to the minutes cma has used the fact that summaries of recent meetings of the following committees were distributed in advance with the tentative agenda to conceal them which they apparently have given up doing to some extent when the documents were actually attached to the minutes instead being distributed in advance of them cma  also see evidence of similar concealment within  board meeting minutes at cma  etc cma concealed the boards approval of continuation of a multicomponent study of vinyl chloride at the university of louisville cma  other likely reform items would permit deduction of only  of cost of businessrelated meals and eliminate deductibility country club dues paid  cma  and   mca board of directors meeting minutes mca concealed the appointment of e b frost as an mca vice president mr drivers appointment of mr frost general council as a vice president of the association was approved cma  cma concealed the special review committee report and all references to the report cma  and exhibit b cma  on three prior occasions  and  board level examinations of the objectives structure and program of the association have been conducted by formal study to assist mcas fitness and performance with respect to services and effective action on industries behalf cma  qwp mollie observations included that because overwhelming legislative regulatory and society pressures mca staff backup particularly for the technical and functional committee work is often hampered by lack of decisive responsiveness and timely support cma  although in some instances there is a specific need emphasis applied for review by council there is a tendency to request council to review and make recommendations rather than first develop technical information emphasis applied and recommend positions for presentation to an agency or legislative body resulting in delay of needed evaluation cma  there is reference to the strong feelings some members of the mca have about a more aggressive advocacy role for this cma especially regarding regulation and questions cma  cma concealed the changes in its committee structure effective  which if accomplished consolidated the previous air quality solid waste management and water resources committees into a new environmental management committee labels and precautionary information occupational health safety and fire protection committees consolidated into a single occupational and health committee and chemical packaging transportation and distribution transportation equipment committees consolidated into a single distribution committee the dissolution of the public relations and education activities committees with their previous functions to be conducted  within staff on a maintenance basis and with executive committee for special pr projects as well as the dissolution of the legal advisory committee which similarly would continue through mca in house general council and designated executive committee members corporate staffs the industrial relations advisory committee was discontinued and the plastics committee was finally discontinued cma  especially considering the courts longexpressed desire that cma and other defendants provide their information primarily of production of documents cma has consistently concealed this sort of relevant almost essential information relating to its cma committee structure and operation cma  all technical and functional committees appointments including the chairman go through the executive committee on the recommendation of the president from the executive committee each technical and functional committee appointment goes to the board for ratification cma  cma concealed that the cma vinyl panels membership which often exceeded fifteen in number was against the general rule and must have qwpmollie been determined by the executive committee to be an advisable exception this says that the term of individual committee members was to be limited to three years cma  with onethird of the membership rotated annually cma  despite the clarity of plaintiffs allegations and the clear relevance of mca modification of its advocacy role as a result of board action to allow increased adequacy on tsca cma  and  these documents clearly show cmas intention to step up its advocacy efforts mca should take an active role in implantation process of tsca which epa was to shortly undertake cma concealed crac was which monitored cmas technical committees was created in furtherance of this advocacy role furtherance of this role a newly constituted chemical regulations advisory committee crac is to be primarily concerned with the development of regulations implanting tsca and to assist epa in its implementation of tsca although mca claims to stand by its previous policy followed only when it suited them to avoid questions involving a particular chemical substance things have changed now and nevertheless should a proposed regulation involve a precedentsetting or firstimpression principle or for other special reasons may be important for mca to take a position mca concealed its official position that mca advocacy does not restrict the independence of mca member companies which is relevant because it is a lie mca advocacy does in fact restrict the independence of mca member companies and documents produced in this case prove it the cma concealed its reference to the sharp rebuke which the house handed the administration ralph nader and congressional leadership by voting down the proposed consumer protection agencies bill which would create a separate department of consumer advocacy in proceedings before other agencies and empowered to appeal agency regulatory decisions cma  this bill had been before congress in one form or another for eight years a similar bill passed the house during the ford administration by  to  the reason for this turnaround is stated to have been  the massive lobbying effort in opposition which was mounted by the business community as well as evidence of a backlash resentment against ralph nader and his tactics wherein he was sharply critical of congressmen who are undecided and especially so when they happened to be former allies cma  qwp mollie cma concealed the relevant activities of the end of the existence of its legislative communication programs including the reference to the survey of  responding companies showing  employees  stock holders  retirees etc cma  and discusses specific efforts to various employers were made or werent making to inform employees stockholders and retirees about pending legislative issues and the potential impact on the company cma  lobbying activities are described in great detail cma  including references to company organization of pacs computer data banks or other retrieval systems which might be useful tools in grass root communication programs etc cma  cma concealed its staff report cma  including the presidents having written osha that the proposed osha standard on the identification of chemical substances would place this incredible burden on all us industry and the us public cma gave epa preliminary information from foster d snell the study of the emissions from facilities producing or using benzene which is reported to have been approximately onehalf of those reported to the advisory committee in the stanford research institute study cma  the guide for the preparation of safety data sheets is now available in a new edition its sixth revision despite the relevance of sd to plaintiffs allegations and discovery subpoenas etc all copies of this guide and all references to it were concealed by cma cma  consistent with prior practice cma concealed information showing that the aihc was the child of industry and that its proposed alternatives concerning regulation of carcinogens appear to be receiving serious consideration by osha and labor cma  cma has again concealed the reports of the technical and functional committees which were distributed in advance of the tentative agenda   cma  and   mca board meeting minutes consistent with its prior practices cma concealed its discussion of the aihc and its large budget originally alhcs purposed solely to the osha proposal for generic regulations carcinogen a poll of its supporting companies has approved broading the scope to apply to carcinogens in the work place which regulatory body is involved amended  replacing the phrase carcinogen in the work place with generic cancer policies qwp mollie cma concealed the report of its government relations committee cma  and  including discussion of the chemical injury indemnity program discussed at the tsca hearings and mca appearances on panels etc cma concealed its staff report cma  discussing mcas appearance at hearings on the proposed generic carcinogen regulations cma concealed references to cracs having developed tsca workshops cma  cmas intervention in the apis appeal of the osha benzene standard cma  cma concealed its reference to its submission of a final report of an epidemiological study of the mortality of workers and workers employed in the production of vinyl chloride and its polymers the report covers the investigations from june   through december  the research covers  workers from  plants and the contractor indicated that cma concealed its support of a taxexempt organization called the american council on science and health founded by dr elizabeth m wheelan author of panic in the pantry and other books which take a reasoned approach to chemicals and to be riskbenefit concept the scientists at acsh fifteen at present are deeply concerned that emotion is replacing science in governmental and public decisions and are pledged to speak out when fallacy or emotion replaces fact in their specialties acsh is being pinched for funds but in the interest of independence and credibility will not accept support from any chemical company or any company in which could even remotely be concerned with the aims of the council however cma concealed that dr wheelan would be happy to hear from you if you are a member of the board of directors of the chemical manufacturers association interested in the work of the council and know of possible sources of funds such as foundations cma  qwp mollie i exhibit b report of the pension committee to the board of directors november   pursuant to its responsibility concerning nonsalary benefits for the associations staff the pension committee recommends approval of the following  adjuatmeht of pension payments to retirees two years ago when the pension plan was revised the principle of periodic adjust ment of pension payments to past retirees in recognition of increased cost of living was accepted since then pension payments to former federal employees have increased by nearly  of which  was occasioned by rise in the consumer price index it is proposed to increase pension payments by  per year in retirement since  the date of the only prior adjustment this would amount to  for the five retirees and one surviving spouse who were then receiving benefits and lesser percentages for the five employees who retired between  and  the amortized annual cost of the proposed adjustment approxi  term life insurance coverage for future retirees for employees mca now provides term life insurance coverage of two times annual salary but no continuation in retirement the option to convert at personal expense is unattractive because of the high cost of attainedage premium continuation is not uncommon however but usually on a re duced and declining scale it is proposed to provide term life insurance for members of the staff retiring from mca on or after december   as follows designed for family protection rather than as an estate factor for any mca retiree who completed seven years of service of which at least five during the tenyer period immediately preceding retirement were continuous and whohas legal dependents at death amount equal to final annual salary subject to a minimum of   and a maximum of   for the first two years in retirement cma  f  amount equal to  of final salary subject to a minimum of   and a maximum of  for the third fourth and fifth years in retirement and   after the fifth year in retirement for any other mca retiree who completed three years of service and who has legal dependents at death amount equal to  of final salary subject to for the first five years in retirement and   after the fifth year in retirement for any other mca retiree at the maximum benefit level   first two years and at current rate quotations the peak cost of about  per individual would occur in the second year of retirement age  overall cost from age  through age  would total about   mca has five employees whose normal retirement dates occur between april  and november  assuming all at the maximum benefit level annual cost would begin at about  in the current year  and build to about   in fiscal year   partial substitution of ordinary life for term life insurance the cost of life insurance provided to an employee in excess of   coverage is supplemental income taxable to the employee at higher salary levels the twotimessalary term life insurance benefit provided by mca imposes a considerable tax outlay iks allows for a combination of term and ordinary life insurance under which the insurance company allocates the premium between the two the imputed cost of any excess above   term plus the cost of the ordinary life is taxable income to the individual advantage lies in a level premium for the ordinary life portion at the starting age making it more attractive for personal continuation on retirement plus the accumulation of cash value it is proposed to divide the coverage equally between ordinary life and term for employees at or above the   salary level namely continue with one times salary of term and substitute the second one tim s cma  salary with ordinary life the estimated aggregate of increased cost to the several employees that would qualify at their current salary levels is about  to the time of retirement whereas the aggregate cash value of their policies at retirement would be about  contrasting with no value at all from term insurance at whatever level the added cost to mca in the current year would approach   dropping to less than   after retirement of the first employee who would qualify  reduction of qualifications for term life insurance coverage formerly there was a linkage in the funding of the pension plan and group term life insurance thus making it logical to set the same age and service qualifications for enrollment concurrent with the revision of the pension plan two years ago however the funding arrangements of the two were separated and became independent of one another while it is legal for an age requirement to be stipulated as being the same as for pension coverage as mca now does it has been learned it would be illegal to specify an age limitation as such it is proposed to eliminate the age requirement now  years rather than retain it on a technicality also the present requirement of one year of service is an un usually long qualification period one to three months being more common it is proposed to lower the requirement to three months this being the period now in effect to qualify for mcas medical benefits the cost of these changes would be minimal there are relative ly few below age  on the staff premium rates for the young are low and their inclusion has an offsetting effect of lowering the average age of the covered group the cost of the reduced service requirement would be modest also

ban on open dumping within five years and authorizations for state and local solid waste management and research programs however electionyear jitters veto threats internal squabbles and the pressure

trade commission carter administration preparing to take office using what pollster lou harris called the old roosevelt coalition as the backbone of his campaign governor jimmy carter of georgia has become presidentelect and is now hard at work on the massive task of organizing his administration recent days have seen mr carter closeted with such ford administration notables as george bush for a security briefing and henry kissinger to talk foreign affairs and at  this afternoon he is in personal conference with president ford to discuss the transition of the government washington bureaucrats politicians and diplomats are giving mr carter close scrutiny perhaps motivated by uneasiness and uncertainty as much as by mere curiosity after all jimmy carter has run as an antiestablishment candidate for nearly two years he has criticized both the form and substance of government in washington s vowed sweeping reforms and new programs has fought bitter campaign tles with recognized leaders of his own party  however on election ht he made a quick transition from critic on the outside to manager n the inside jimmy carter now is the establishment fe cma  and therefore he is now confronted with a dilemma of some delicacy how to begin to direct and to motivate the people and the mechanisms he has so recently and soundly castigated he must find and appoint cabinet heads and officeholders with the capacity to make the machinery of government work and this would seem to indicate a need for experi enced personnel but at the same time he must avoid the appearance of making his appointments from the lists of known political figures and party professionals he needs new faces but he also needs the reliability and depth of background that only experience can provide there are signs that a number of carter appointments may be revealed relatively soon so that incoming officials will have maximum time for planning and coordination with departing officials of the ford administration observers around the world will be carefully watching these appointments for clues to the attitudes of the carter administration the influence being wielded by various interest groups and powerbrokers and for indications as to the political wisdom of the presidentelect himself among the most delicate tasks confronting mr carter and one he appears to recognize clearly as such is the establishing of communica tions links with  and hopefully some measure of control over  the congress his recent meeting with  democratic congressional leaders last week at the farmestate of georgia senator herman talmadge was surely an effort to hold out the olive branch and to begin to build support for key programs the discussions were reportedly broad in nature touching on matters relating to the strength of the economy andreorganization of government some observers believe however that the new president may encounter considerable difficulty with the congress despite the fact that both ends of pennsylvania avenue are now firmly in democratic hands they reason it this way congressional leaders and committee chairmen while criticizing the stalemate government of presidents nixon and ford have obviously enjoyed the indepen dence and status which the years of confrontation have produced they have had an important role in punishing one president and in making his successor appear ineffectual and are therefore likely to covet their independence of action moreover bills and programs delayed by attention to watergate or stalled by ford vetoes are already in fairly polished form and are not likely to be dropped readily by their sponsors in favor of carter alternatives yet another factor will be the attitude of the white house itself and longtime carter watchers point out that he adopted a tough no compromise attitude toward the georgia legislature during his term as governor cma  mew president and his views much of official washington is now speculating on the future sections of policy and programs in the carter administration however from speeches and statements by the presidentelect and from the democratic party platform itself it is possible to reach some preliminary judgments with respect to the economy governor carter appears firmly in favor of creating more jobs and providing stimulus to the national economy the prospect of a oneshot tax cut is being seriously discussed the formation of a national youth corp to hire and train young people from urban areas is another carter aim and is consistent with bis support for direct job creation with emphasis on public service employment he also favors moderate interest rates continued support of investment credits strong antitrust enforcement and a strengthening of the council on wage and price stability tax reform though a popular topic at the campaign podium will take considerably longer to accomplish the environment will receive high priority in the carter adminisation the incoming president has opposed extending the compliance feadlines for automobile exhaust emissions and would apparently retain the present nondegredation concepts of the clean air act he has called for strict enforcement of water pollution control laws and evidently will oppose efforts to weaken the federal water pollution control act he supports strict controls over strip mining m national energy policies may undergo some changes under president carter with greater emphasis on energy conservation and a strengthening of environmental controls over energy production he plans to deemphasize nuclear development and to require stricter regulation in construction of new nuclear power plants he evidently will push for increased reliance on domestic coal from the deep mines of appalachia and would oppose heavy development of stripmined coal resources in the western united states he opposes further expansion of western coalleasing and supports strong state participation in offshore oil lease decisions he would favor mandatory mileage standards for automobiles with economic penalties on those with less fuel efficiency he opposes federal subsidies for synthetic fuel production me th congress new faces new leaders same vote ratios when the smoke of election day had cleared the new congress koked almost exactly like the old one  th senate will again be imposed of  democrats and  republicans and the house shows a shift to the democrats of only two seats the new ratio being  in their favor cma   on closer inspection however the changes will be both numerous and significant virtually the entire leadership with change in both houses and in both parties there is a substantial crop of freshmen especially in the senate there will be many shifts in key committee responsibilities there is talk of major committee realignment in the senate the house will organize itself in early december in that members will be named to committees new chairmen will be elected and changes in house rules and committee jurisdictions will be considered not until the th congress convenes in january however will subcommittee assignments be made committee rules considered or leadership positions voted on there are  new house members  democrats and  republicans overall the election produced overwhelming success for incumbents with  percent of those running being returned to office the strong reelection rate held true for the  socalled watergate freshmen those democratic congressmen first elected in the offyear el ction of  despite high republican hopes against that group  ran for reelection and  won there will be a number of important changes in the chairmanships of house committees and subcommittees  in all including new chairmen for the following  budget committee committee year rotation rule  the interior committee jurisdiction includes energy matters mining  international relations committee foreign affairs  merchant marine and fisheries merchant marine matters oceanography coastal zone management  post office committee the postal system  public works and transportation committee water pollution control most transportation matters  rules committee clearance of legislation for house floor debate another development worthy of mention is the fact that there are seven vacancies to be filled on the house ways and means committee wherein taxation and trade legislation are written cma  i  the senate will also undergo some interesting changes incumbents didnt fare as well as their house colleagues with only  of the  senators running being returned the  percent reelection rate for incumbents was the lowest in the history of direct senate elections there will be  freshman senators counting governor wendell anderson who will replace vice presidentelect mondale ten are democrats and eight republicans three committee chairmen were defeated hartke veterans affairs moss aeronautics and space and mcgee post office and civil service there will be considerable change in the memberships of several senate committees including commerce where there are  vacancies to be filled finance  vacancies and judiciary  vacancies a further unknown in the senate is whether or not reorganization will bring a significant shift in committee jurisdictions and respon sibilities a reorganization proposal in the form of a senate resolution has been drafted by the committee on committees headed by senator adlai e stevenson jr dlll and could be taken up early in  the resolution presents a number of alternatives for consideration and could eventually lead to elimination of some committees and the shifting of important environmental and energy responsibilities cma  exhibit g report to the board of directors manufacturing chemists association joseph sandford jr chairman chemical packaging committee november   the activities of the chemical packaging committee emphasize two major areas  regulations and legislation our objective today is to provide background on our committee oper ations and how we are assisting each of our companies to achieve both safety in packaging and regulatory compliance times have changed just a few years ago a chemical packaging engineer might be concentrating on the steel thickness of a drum for solvents the moisture barrier in a bag for plastic resins or a fungicide box closure today he must also know about the transportation safety act of  the consolidation of dot regulations the metric conversion act of  inter national shipping regulations and looking to the future reg ulations on solid waste disposal and carcinogens what has caused this change in our committees activ ities we believe the most important factor is the concern on the part of both the private and public sectors for greater safety in the packaging transportation and distribution of haz ardous materials the department of transportations past two annual reports on hazardous materials control are more specific about this concern over safety in these two years  fatalities and over  injuries occurred in all hazardous materials incidents of which over  involved chemical products the de partment of transportation or as we usually say dot also lists the ten worst accidents for each year  of these in volved chemical industry products with a total of nine fatalities and  people injured it is for reasons like this that the committees activities emphasize regulations and legislation the major legislative act affecting our activities is the transportation safety act of  passed by congress in early  key points include the d partment of transportations authority is extended to regulate package unloading certain types of storage and shipment routing cma  procedures for obtaining package exemptions are made much more complex dot authority is extended to container manufacturers and even to commodities not presently defined as hazardous criminal as well as civil penalties can be imposed for violations with imprisonment for up to five years now included in the regulatory field dot has just issued its complete consolidation of title  of the code of federal regulations which contains the regulations governing the trans portation and packaging of hazardous materials this document has been over four years in preparation and incorporates many regulatory changes affecting the use labeling marking and shipment of chemical packages the metric conversion act has been enacted into law it creates a metric board to oversee voluntary conversion in the united states we believe metrication will initially affect our export packaging with domestic packages going metric over the next ten years our liaison with canadian mca member companies  is providing valuable input based on their experience in metric conversion export shipments require industry packaging personnel to be aware of united nations and xmco regulations and appropriate rail and truck regulations in the various countries to which we ship the regulations of imco or more properly the intergovern mental maritime consultative organization are contained in an eightvolume set covering water movement of hazardous materials solid waste disposal legislation recently enacted has not affected packaging however legislation proposed but not passed would have imposed a fee on packaging materials that are not reusable or recyclable regulations and legislation while deeply involved with safety also have an economic effect on packaging dot recognizes this to a degree and has introduced the term costbenefit to be considered in any reviews of package regulation changes packaging is a significant cost item in our industry the chemical industry uses over  million new and reconditioned steel and fibre drums annually at a cost of about  million the industry uses about seven billion square feet of corrugated fibreboard in boxes to hold our plastics agricultural chemicals and acids at an cma annual cost of  million we use some  million bags and  million pallets a year the total annual cost of packaging materials in our industry approaches  billion or about  of sales perhaps of equal importance from a solid waste disposal standpoint this represents in the range of one billion pounds of steel one and a half billion pounds of paperboard and  million pounds of wood the agendas and organization of the committees task groups and subcommittees reflect our concern over regulations and legislation a few examples illustrate the positive action we are taking to assist our industry first we recently formed a new regulations and legis lation subcommittee to control all of our activities in this area such as metrication definitions of hazardous materials liaison with dot and our activities on the intercommittee group on international regulations our metrication task group coordinates committee activity with initial efforts emphasizing proper inclusion of m trication in dot regulations and coordination of differences in export and domestic regulations the small packages subcommittee is developing a tech nical bulletin on proper packaging and transportation of samples and small quantities a task group has developed technical bulletins on proper techniques for loading bracing and blocking in truck rail car and piggyback shipments dot regulations require safe loading but dont really specify effective techniques a newly proposed hazardous materials regulation spec ified testing requirements that current acid carboys would not pass a task group worked closely with suppliers to develop a new carboy design that met all requirements a recent change in the definition and test for corrosive materials meant that drums currently used for products such as dyes cleaning compounds or mining reagents were no longer legal the drum subcommittee coordinated industry input and succeeded in having a new section added in title  to cover these lower hazard products and allow continued use of present packages cma  the increasing complexity and many changes in the regulations created a need for greater awareness on the part of our employees as well as those in our carrier and distributor organizations the committee together with the transportation equipment and transportation and distribution committees spon sored a symposium on hazardous materials regulations with over  attendees from all concerned shipper and carrier groups as to the future each subcommittee has an active task group reviewing waste disposal effects on our packages including possible reuse and recycle the plastic drum task group recently sponsored a workshop on plastic drum development with dot the national bureau of standards which is dots contracting agency on plastic drum developments and representatives from the plastic drum institute the producers association hopefully this joint approach which we consider to be a significant breakthrough will provide the forum for full participation by all groups in regulations development and application in the future we may have an entirely new class of hazardous materials to package since dot has already indicated they have under development regulations applying to the proper packaging and transportation of health products such as carcinogens mutagens and teratogens the chemical packaging committee activities far exceed  earlier efforts in the design and development of drums bags or boxes to safely carry our products we must consider the product itself and any potential health hazard the package and packaging  operation to insure we meet dot regulations the transportation and distribution requirements such as proper loading bracing and blocking customers must be able to safely use our packages and looking to the future we must be able to return them or provide safe reuse or disposal to prevent solid waste problems in summary we believe our responsibility is to assist the chemical industry to meet all legal requirements while main taining a lowrisk position in transportation with proper cost benefit considerations and we intend to make known the position of our industry on legislative and regulatory matters we have emphasized today the effect of regulations and legislation on packaging actually the areas covered affect the entire field of transportation and distribution in the chemical industry most member companies have active pro grams relating to hazardous materials du pont calls its cma  program the rhythm program an acronym for remember how you treat hazardous materials xn closing i will show a short film that was developed to summarize this program although it emphasizes only one companys efforts we believe it helps illustrate the continued need for mca commitment and involvement in transportation distribution and packaging activities cma  exhibit h report to board of directors manufacturing chemists association james e mckee jr chairman public relations committee november   th hazards of holding the same office for two years are obvious my position today is not unlike that of a reelected politician its important to assess what was said to this audience last year in  the public relations committee report covered two main points for future action  that we would focus more sharply on major opportunities as well as the larger problems of the chemical industry and  that we would establish closer relationships with other functional areas of mca so a more meaningful contribution to the industrys total communications could be made these things have been done the assaults on the chemical industry by media and government in the past  months have made it imperative in addition the opportunity to participate in dr heckerts special committee on toxic substances legislation demonstrated what can be accomplished through interaction of functions when proper leadership is provided spurred by todays public demands and the proof that joint committee action can get things done the public relations committee stepped tip its practice of meeting with the leadership of certain other functional committees particularly government relations technical and legal advisory this was started about  months ago to gain a better perspective of mcas needs what we have found is that we can work together  that we can have a common purpose and pursuit we have agreed upon issues that should be the greatest concern of the association these are human health and the environment and increasing govern ment constraints which erode industrys management of its resources cooperation to date has prompted us to adopt a plan for industry spokesmanship encompassing an even larger number of functional committees the plan was proposed by a former chairman of our committee ned brandt of dow and adopted at our september meeting most of the committees we have approached have already responded favorably these committees are air quality water resources solid waste occupational health government relations legal advisory and chemical regulations advisory cma  the plan calls for establishing a task force with representatives of those committees and the public relations committee to stimulate spokesmanship on the public issues each committee will be asked to provide basic facts and a statement representing mcas position on their function as related to govern ment health and environment the air quality committee for example will provide facts on what the chemical industry has done about air pollution and provide the industry position on current legislative and regulatory matters members of the task force would serve as coordinators of the project recruit the best possible spokesmen from mcas membership and arrange platforms in leading cities where maximum exposure to our point of  view can be gained we have in mind prestigious platforms like the economic club of detroit with accompanying appearances on local radio and tv plus newspaper interviews the task force would be responsible for placing industry material in the hands of selected spokesmen coordinating appearances on a geographic basis and making sure that the load was properly spread among the member companies each speaker would develop his topic in his own way weaving in the mcadeveloped material at will the type of spokesmen we have in mind are you gentlemen the directors of mca supported by other chief executive officers not present today the plan has both short and longrange advantages the short range is obvious  to gain some badly needed statements of the chemical industry point of view in various media the longer range advantage will be gained as we build up this corps of spokesmen mca has a constant need for industry experts who can provide statements and make appearances on relatively short notice news media as you know will use responses to issues and handle the other sides position when the story is breaking there is no public relations benefit in a tardy response its either ignored or becomes a liability as its availability provides the media opportunity to retell the whole sordid story we hope to get this plan underway in early  it goes without saying that all ongoing pr programs are being directed toward the same issues to which the spokesmanship plan will be addressed cma  i chemecology will expand further its coverage of member company success stories in the areas of environment and toxic substances participation next april in the american women in radio and television spokesmanship program for lay audiences will stress positive contributions by the chemical industry with emphasis on health and environmental protection mca news will continue to report on industry and company programs in these key public issues so that good ideas can be shared across the membership we are considering an idea proposed by our member from american cyanamid joe calitri whereby awards could be given to member company plants which have achieved goals in energy conservation this program of course could demonstrate mcas dedication to energy conservation and show that even without a national energy policy  the industry is dedicated to conservation we will also continue our threetimesayear chemical issues  commentary  the survey of member companies to identify emerging issues this practice goes back to  when we began polling people participating in mca activities in six companies and the professional staff of mca that panel has now grown to  companies and mca with over  respondents and its the study upon which we base our forward planning we share with you today gentlemen its well known that the th congress will inherit roost of this years environmental and energy issues water and air pollution legislation will doubtless take over the spotlight recently occupied by toxic substances chemicals in food and food packaging will join other lurking problems like pesticides to keep all of us busy we must be prepared to answer our critics to itemize consequences of tradeoffs and to accentuate the positive side of the chemical industry cma  exhibit i report to the board of directors of the manufacturing chemists association by matthew p landers november   i appreciate the opportunity to report to you again on the activities of the tax policy committee since the vice chairman of our committee frederick barbour of rohm and haas reported to you in september of  we have been concerned primarily with the legislative activity which led up to enactment of the tax reform act of  on october  last year when the house ways and means committee conducted ts h aring on tax reform i had the honor to testify on behalf fj th association after passing the house late in  the tax reform act was referred to the senate where it underwent hearings in the senate finance committee this past spring at that time as you will recall mr f perry wilson chairman of the board of union carbide appeared on behalf of the association our testimony before both committees was devoted to two principal areas  namely capital formation and taxation of foreign source income in the capital formation area we recommended the adoption of such tax incentives as making the  investment tax credit permanent reducing the corporate income tax rate and providing additional cost recovery allowances we contended these actions are needed to assist industry to generate sufficient funds internally to meet capital requirements in the foreign area we recommended that no change be made in the foreign tax credit provisions and none with respect to the timing of the imposition of us tax on foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries the socalled deferral issue in order to stimulate ports and to improv our balanc of payments position we also ecommended that the disc be retained cma   the tax reform act as finally enacted pl  is a massive document containing many hundreds of provisions which will touch every taxpayer corporate and individual in the country i understand that bill stover briefed you gentlemen in september on the more significant provisions of the bill as agreed to by the housesenate conference committee as these provisions remained basically unchanged on final passage of the legislation  will point out a few areas which the new law does not address j i i aside from extending the investment tax credit through  the act does little to assist capital formation although a task force of the house ways and means committee headed by chairman a ullman of oregon conducted a study to consider the use of the tax code to stimulate capital formation it has not yet published its report j i in the foreign source income area the new tax law has a numb r of disturbing provisions but it did not deal to any basic extent with the two items of major concern to industry namely the timing of taxation of foreign source income socalled deferral and the foreign tax credit you will recall that a group of tax reformminded senators sponsored amendments to require current taxation of the income of foreign subsidiaries of us companies and to change the foreign tax credit to a deduction but their proposals were all defeated f the house ways and means committee also set up a task force headed by representative rostenkowski dill to study the taxation of foreign income no report has been issued and we have no indication as to what recommendations are likely to be forthcoming considering the initial attitude of the th congress we believe our industry was most fortunate to emerge with the major tax provisions affecting foreign source income relatively intact f  the mca tax policy committee has also been active with resp ct to recent rulemaking proposals initiated by the internal revenue service we have been particualrly concerned with a proposal to amend section  of the income tax regulations which relates to the allocation and apportionment of deductions for income tax purposes as you will recall without the benefit of change in the law or court decisions in  the treasury department proposed revis d regulations which would cause most companies to lose substantial i t i i f  cma  i  foreign tax credits mca went on record in  and again in  opposing the regulations and recommending that they be withdrawn because of industrys strong opposition these proposed regulations were never finalized within the past year there has been a great deal of renewed governmental activity regarding these regulations and the internal revenue service and the treasury department appeared anxious to finalize them in the meantime the economic policy board became interested in the  issue that board established a task force composed of representatives of a number of federal agencies including the departments of commerce and treasury and the council on international economic policy to study the problem during the past year the treasury department proposed a series of compromises aimed at overcoming industry opposition to the proposed regulations members of our tax policy committee have had a number of meetings with representatives of treasury and the council on international economic policy concerning the regulations and h suggested treasury revisions it was the opinion of a majority of the tax policy committee members that the treasury departments suggested changes to the  proposed regulations did not go far enough to make the regulations acceptable to the chemical industry therefore we have continued to oppose the proposed regulations our opposition has been directed primarily at those provisions of the regulations which would require that a portion of domestic r  d expense be allocated against a companys foreign income in the case of a company with large r  d expenditures this could have the effect of substantially reducing that companys foreign tax credit resulting in significant double taxationi i might mention that there was a minority view within the tax policy committee recommending support for the treasury proposal to reissue the proposed regulations in modified form providing we made it clear that we reserved the right to object to the proposed regulations after we have had an opportunity to study them this view was based on the thought that the revised proposal represented a substantial improvement over the original  proposal this view was not shared by the majority of our committee cma  because of a united front on these questions by many organiza tions including mca the machinery and allied products institute the national foreign trade council and others we understood the issu was dead for  we were quite surprised therefore when the internal revenue service published the revised regulations in proposed form on november th we understand that this action was taken by the treasury department without clearing the subject with the economic policy board the new proposals are quite complicated and our member companies are currently studying them to determine their effect it is apparent that the impact can be different from company to company dependent upon various business factors and we anticipate differences of i opinion as to whether mca should support or oppose the provisions a written statement will be prepared based on comments to be received from our members by november th public hearings will be held in washington on december th and it is anticipated that a representai tive of the tax policy committee will appear in conclusion i would like to state that we faced  with a great deal of trepidation as to the final effect of the tax reform act of  we were quite active in attempting to present the chemical industrys viewpoint and feel quite relieved to have come through the year as well as we did we now face the coming year in anticipation of greater tax activity our goal remains to obtain legislation to aid in capital formation and hopefully an enlightened attitude in congress with regard to the necessity to maintain our competitiveness abroad we are commencing this year with hearing activity on the section  regulations and anticipate further activity as regulations on the boycott and illegal payments provisions are published in other words your tax policy committee has had a busy year and expects to remain active and vigilant in the year ahead i want to thank you gentlemen for the support you have given us and i will answer any questions you might wish to ask cma  exhibit c report by the director of government relations william m stover january   ullman at the chemical forum featured speaker at todays chemical forum luncheon will be the honorable a uliman dore chairman of the house ways and means committee since replacing wilbur mills as leader of this powerful committee in  mr ullman has succeeded in putting his own personal stamp of its methods and achievements the critical issues of tax reform trade regulation energy conser vation pension reform and congressional budget lie within the

congress he is expected to take questions from the audience at the conclusion of his remarks senate and house convene the th congress began on january  as members of the house and senate gathered to elect new leaders and to commence an am bitious program of organization reorganization and legislative problemsolving in scarcely more than a week the congress  elected new leaders four new faces in the five top leadership posts  began work on rules changes and reorganization plans house procedural changes are aimed primarily at fa cilitating consideration of legislation on the floor while senate reorganization is a potentially farreaching consolidation of committee jurisdictions cma    began senate confirmation hearings on carter cabinet choices  introduced a flood of bills some  introduced on the first day in the house of representatives alone  engaged in the process of assigning members to commit tees and determining chairmanships the house could complete committee assignments by january  but the senate will require considerably longer to finalize its structure the massive reorganization plan under consideration by the senate rules conmittee will cause delay and until its fate is determined the freshmen senators have been given temporary assignments decided by chance president ford remains active amid preparations for the delivery of his final stateoftheunion message january  president ford has found time to submit a number of policy proposals for public consideration and possible congressional action in recent days he has  proposed that puerto rico be granted statehood  sent to the congress a major tax reduction message which calls for a  billion cut in personal income taxes and  billion in corporate tax cuts few observers expect the proposal to be seriously considered but it may serve as a yardstick against which to measure the scope of presidentelect carters economic stimulus package  submitted to the congress a comprehensive energy message which emphasized the importance of prompt action while warning against easy answers and opposing a sharply expanded federal role in energy matters readied a proposal to lift gasoline price controls f cma  w presidentelect carter reveals outlines of economic stimulus package and other legislative timetables while continuing to meet with and make decisions on prospective officeholders for his

expansion of certain public works programs  billion  increased grants to cities in the neighborhood of  the carter plan has already drawn criticism from the aflcio elements of the news media and figures on capitol hill who char acterize it as cautious too slow and lacking in direct jobs creation meanwhile keycarter aides have revealed the broad outlines of his legislative timetables they hope that by february  legis lation can be submitted which would set up an overall energy de partment and enable the new president to begin broad reorganization of the executive branch by april  the new administration will submit a message outlining energy and environmental issues may  is the deadline for a draft of legislation designed to bring about reform of the welfare system the economic recovery and stimulation program is more immediate however with the carter blueprint ex pected to be sent to the congress by the end of january congres sional leaders of both the house and senate have pledged to give it early attention cma section  regulations approved on january  the commissioner of internal revenue approved new income tax regulations relating to the allocation and apportionment of deductions to gross income to determine taxable income from sources within and without the united states  the sorcalled section  regulations initially proposed in  they were withdrawn and reproposed in revised form last november mca submitted written comments strongly opposing the  proposal then testified at a public hearing in  recommending that the proposed rules be withdrawn the revised proposed regulations issued last november met a number of our earlier objections but still contained provisions which we considered burdensome we then submitted written comments on the revised proposal questioning the issuance of regulations in the absence of enabling legislation and recommending additional changes a member of our tax policy committee presented our testimony at an irs hearing in middecember the final regulations are substantially similar to those issued last november but certain clarifying amendments were adopted basically they will cause an increase in the amount of deductions expenses and losses of u s taxpayers required to be allocated to foreign gross income the allowable foreign tax credit will be proportionately reduced because taxable income from sources abroad determined under the new rules will almost always be less than that which would be determined under the old regulations the effect of the new regulations on individual companies is likely to vary widely depending on factors such as the scope of foreign operations the quantity of research and development ac tivity performed within the united states and the amount of domestic interest expense in late november the tax policy committee was polled on the strategy question of whether or not to request a delay for the submission of comments on the new revised regulations the com mittee opinion was evenly divided and no consensus could be reached r now that the regulations have been finalized some member compani s may wish to chall nge the legality of th r gulatlons through independent litigation we do not anticipate further mca action with regard to the  regulations at the pr sent time t cma   energy conservation goal the energy policy and conservation act of  requires the federal energy administration to set energy conservation goals for the ten most energyintensive industries ours being first and foremost fea engaged contractors to carry on studies and propose goals the contractor in our case was battelle memorial institute with chem systems as a subcontractor initially battelle arrived at a figure of  energy conservation per unit of output by january   as compared with  fea rounded this out to a goal of  and scheduled a hearing on it for december  shortly before the hearing battelle revised its figure to  accordingly ronald s wishart jr chairman of mcas energy conservation committee testified in support of a  goal we understand from reliable sources that fea has decided on the  figure however this has not yet been of ficially proclaimed the fea has until january  to make its formal announcement a  goal by january   would be virtually identical with our earlier consensus goal of  since this was to have been achieved in calendar  a little later incidentally the achievement of the goal is not mandatory although failure to do so could obviously incur public and congressional relations problems  top energyconsuming companies identified epca requires fea to identify the top fifty energyconsuming companies in each of the ten most energy intensive industries the lists were published in the federal register of december  some  of the  chemical companies listed are mca members of these  are taking part in our voluntary energy conservation reporting program the other four are companies whose major out put is in areas other than basic industrial chemicals and they are reporting through other trade associations the companies so listed would be subject to mandatory in dividual reporting unless exempted through participation in an industrywide voluntary program such as mcas to secure such exemption both the trade association concerned and the partici pating companies individually have to file requests with fea cma  mca did so in december  having advance information on the mca member companies to be listed mca notified them on december  providing a sample letter to be sent to fea it is believed that all concerned mca member companies have responded and that our participating companies will be able to carry on the report ing program as before with minor revisions exhibit d report to the board of directors manufacturing chemists association john j moyna chairman food drug and cosmetic chemicals committee january   i welcome this opportunity to acquaint you with some of the areas of our committees concern in the past year and some of the legal and regulatory problems confronting the food additive and pharmaceutical segments of the industry in the year ahead in the area of major new legislation we anticipate that congress will act on the food surveillance bill this bill was passed by the senate in  and was under active consideration by the rogers committee in the house when congress adjourned among its principal provisions is a requirement for the registration with fda of all plants which manufacture foods or food chemicals it kill also impose on every segment of the food processing industry rthe obligation of selfpolicing by each manufacturers establishment and adherence to adequate safety assurance procedures appropriate to his plant these procedures are to identify areas in the manufac turing process in which product adulteration is likely or possible and set forth and implement effective measures to reduce or elimi nate the risk of adulteration the  senate bill offered no guidelines on determining the adequacy of the safety assurance procedures and the vagueness of the new law may present substantial compliance problems another important area which the senate bill addressed and which we believe congress will act upon in  is the impact of the us supreme court decision in us v park in the park case the supreme court ruled that a corporate executive could be prose cuted under the criminal provisions of the food drug  cosmetic act for product adulteration irrespective of his personal ignorance of the situation causing the adulteration and however remote his involvement in that situation the court thus imposed absolute criminal liability based merely upon the responsibility of individual corporate officers for certain areas of activity the consumer food legislation would limit the criminal responsibility of executives to those situations in which the adulteration arose from some negli gence or intentional conduct on the part of the responsible company cma  official in the same vein the food  drug administration will issue regulations implementing and defining its policy under the park decision our committee will be following both those develop ments very closely other requirements of the new legislation will be extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements and coding and labeling requirements designed to expedite recalls in the regulatory areas fda has already published proposed regulations for good laboratory practices designed to insure the accuracy and sufficiency of test data submitted to the agency in support of new drug applications food and color additive petitions and similar applications where fda approval is required our involved subcommittees will undertake to determine the appropriateness of submitting comments on these proposed regulations additional areas of regulatory activity and concern will include fdas gras review of food chemicalsa subject on which our committee has submitted extensive comments in the pastand the po tential impact of the toxic substances legislation upon food drug  cosmetic chemicals i would like to say a few words on the latter subject upon initial review ofhe toxic substances legislation many of the regulatory affairs and legal people in the pharmaceutical and food industries took comfort from what seemed to be a total exemption from coverage accorded to foods drugs and cosmetics on closer scrutiny however it becomes apparent that intermediate chem icals used in the manufacture of finished food additives and drugs may well be covered by the new law the question of the applicability of the toxic substances legislation to drug and food chemical inter mediates requires early resolution because of the consequences which attend noninclusion of a chemical in epas inventory of old chemical substances under the act if in fact all intermediates are covered by the new law pharmaceutical and food chemical manu facturers will probably be required to report all intermediates to epa in order to avoid the consequences of new chemical status hope fully our committee will be able to make some input to epa on this important question epa has requested suggestions of all interested persons on its prospective administration of the toxic substances law and plans to hold a number of public hearings to solicit further comment so much for the year ahead i wouldlike to comment very cma  i briefly on our committees activities for the past year the committee drafted recommended comments for mca on the pdas recall regulations in september of  mca had previously commented on the agencys general procedural regulations governing adminis trative hearings these comments represent a considerable commit ment of time and effort on the part of individual members of our committee in its final administrative procedure regulations fda recognized the validity of many of our points and indicated that its implementation of the regulations would take into account the concerns we expressed the effectiveness of our committeeand of mcaas an industry voice is to some extent limited by the limited time in which to submit comments to the agency and the mca committee structure itself which  relies almost completely on the work product of the committee members in the last regard i believe that the committees effectiveness could be enhanced by more direct mca staff involvement with fda representatives on issues of general interest and by more active staff participation in the preparation of written input on agency proposals this is intended as recognition of limitations inherent in mcas method of operation not as a reflection on the staff i am grateful for this opportunity to give you some idea of our committees activities and concerns and welcome any specific questions you may have cma  exhibit e mca industrial relations advisory committee report to the board of directors january   john j radigan chairman in september  i had the privilege of speaking to the board of directors to report on the industrial relations advisory committees activities at that time i took a few minutes to crystalball what i saw in the near future in the broad area of industrial relations as i indicated in my projections we have seen relatively high inflation continue through  coupled with high increases in wages at all levels new and improved fringe ben fits including dental plans have become commonplace and we hav witnessed a strong push for job security fueled by the reces sion in my opinion even though inflation has slowed down and hop fully will continue to do so wages will rise in excess of the current level of inflation and fringe benefits together with job s curity will become the main thrust of organized labor other forms of insurance programs such as those covering automobiles and legal fees will reach the bargaining table as to job security we shall see in the next three to five years a definite major breakthrough in this area which will spill over into most of our major companies and industries with such in novations as guaranteed work weeks no time cards etc a key negotiation to watch in this regard is that between the basic steel industry and the united steelworkers of america the initial session is scheduled for february  and they will continue voluntary negotia tions until april  at which time any unresolved national contract issues will be submitted to arbitration under the experimental negotiation agreement the arbitration panel is to issue its decision no later than july  security is shaping up as a major item since costofliving protection and a standardofliving increase are foregone conclusions this includes income security and employ ment security and could include costofliving adjustments on vacations pensions and insurance benefits and further restrictions on contractingout of work a shorter work week and additional paid days off could also be in th picture although there has b en a great deal of talk about codetermina tion and works councils migrating from europe i do not think they cma  will become a part of our industrial life here in the united stafas at least not in the near future  and if at all not in the same form as we are experiencing in europe two other areas which will stand out for increased future activity are occupational safety and health and equal employment opportunity whether you have unions or not your employees are becoming more aware of their rights in these areas if you have unions many are building technical staffs in the safety hygiene and health fields to aid their locals in auditing the safety of our work places several companies in our industry have experienced employee health crises in the last year with the resulting employee and public relations problems we must be prepared to devote more management time and resources to avoid further employee anxieties about the safety of their work locations as for osha itself dr corn who now heads it has attempted to bring a balance to the agency stressing education rather than only compliance i under the best of circumstances those of us with unions can i expect to hear more about health and safety in future negotiations unions are impatient with osha indeed one  the oil chemical and atomic workers  is suing osha we should expect that this impatience will result in a more direct approach with employers including demands for safety committees with authority use of union safety consultants in our plants and higher visibility for such union oriented medical consultants as dr irving selikoff who has recently been featured at union conventions including those of the ocaw and the international chemical workers union the equal employment field is another fastchanging one initially most union leadership stayed far afield of employers equal employment activities and understandably most of their membership was white and male and didnt advocate or want much change but as our efforts to better utilize minorities and females have been successful these same unions are now respond ing to this growing minority and female membership in several ways the grievance procedure has always been available to resolve problems including those of alleged discrimination but we havent seen anything yet hourly employees in increasing numbers are utilizing all available forums to resolve their discrimination com plaints  grievance procedures local and state human rights com missions the eeoc the employers compliance agency as well as private equal employment groups union leadership will push to become more involved in our equal employment opportunity efforts partly out of a new interest and partly to protect themselves from discrimination charges from their new female and minority members cma  this will continue to burden us with timeconsuming and expensive investigations and litigations however i forecast an even more difficult time as the concept of affirmative action is applied to the employment and upgrading of professional employees our abilities as managers to plan organize control evaluate and motivate will be tested as never before there follow detailed reports on particular areas of the committees interest the outlook for labor legislation in the new congress spokesmen for organized labor have declared that they are going to give overriding priority to measures to revive the economy and reduce unemployment rather than to their own parochial interests it is clear that the incoming administra tion is similarly inclined though not clear whether it is as enthusiastic as labor in support of the humphreyhawkins bill however after the administration and the congress have done what they can about unemployment the unions will be pressing the nactment of measures of particular interest to them with greater hope of success in view of the makeup of the congress and the leading role labor played in the carter victory the unions lengthy shopping list includes fair labor standards act  bills will be introduced to increase the minimum hourly wage with  a likely shortterm target in addition proposals will be made to index the minimum wage by tieing it to wage movements generally or to the consumer price index as a consequence of the current high rate of unemployment which seems likely to prevail through  bills will be introduced with the stated objective of spreading the available work by increas ing the present  overtime premium for hours worked over forty per proposals also will be made under the walshhealey public contracts act to raise the present  premium for hours worked in excess of eight per day to  national labor relations act  our success via presidential veto in opposing common situs picketing in  may be shortlived bills are certain to be introduced to legalize secondary boycotts at construction sites ie to permit one union to picket an entire project involving several employers and unions further there will likely be a serious attempt to repeal section b the socalled right to work provision under which  states predominantly in the south have banned compulsory union membership clauses bills will be pressed to speed up nlrb proc sses for example to make cma  the recommended orders of administrative law judges formerly trial examiners selfexecuting and final subject to appeal upon grant of certiorari by the labor board meaning the board at its discretion may entertain appeal currently even orders of the board are not selfexecuting rather the board must petition a circuit court of appeals for enforcement of orders equal employment opportunity  bills are likely to be introduce which would confer upon the equal employment opportunity commission much of the power enjoyed by the national labor relations board ie to make determinations that unfair employment practices have been committed eeoc presently is authorized to investigate and conciliate discrimination charges and where it is unsuccessful in conciliation to institute suit against the alleged violators the supreme court recently decided that employers need not as a matter of law equate pregnancy leave and disability leave insofar as pay continuation or insured benefits are concerned while this decision lifted the threat of substantial backpay liability from employers it will spur the filing of bills to compel employers in the future to fully equate pregnancy leave and disability leave unemployment compensation  there will be a strong push to impose upon the stateadministered system a set of federal minimum benefits standards ie to set a floor not a ceiling workers compensation  here too the matter of federal benefits standards will be pressed at least equal attention will be given to imposing federal standards for coverage of occupational diseases conceivably the latter standards might include presumption of the occupational nature of disease absent proof to the contrary ie mer employment in the vicinity of a given substance would give rise to the presumption plant closing or relocation controls  some attempt is likely to revive the proposal made in the previous congress requiring employers to give advance notice as much as two years of plant closings andor relocations such legislation would give the labor depart ment the power to hold public hearings and to deprive the employer of tax benefits eg investment tax credit deferral of tax on foreign income where a closing or relocation was found unjustified this proposal seems so extreme as to render passage most unlikely howeveiii it is entirely conceivable that congress may authorize a study of plant relocations by major employers the study might well extend i beyond the u s to include the alleged export of jobs by usbased multinational firms i i cma  i pensions social security and health insurance the new pension legislation became effective in  all private pension plans had to be adjusted to conform with it the three major areas of adjustment were  vesting  funding and  making joint survivorship mandatory in all plans the basic intention was to assure sound funding and widows benefits for all private plans an unintended effect has been a high number of pension plan terminations by small employers due to the high cpst of administration this will probably call for some revisions in the legislation during  the social security system has operated in the red for the past two years although the th congress ultimately took no action seemingly the th congress will have to do something to cope with the continuing flow of red ink industry for the most part is resigned to acceptance of an increase in the tax rate now  and taxable wage base  in   the latter to move with wages and salaries generally however there is strong senti ment among some legislators to tap general revenues andor to dis pense with any ceiling on the taxable wage base but without com mensurate increase in benefits for higherpaid persons  no change is in the offing in the age requirements for receipt of old age benefits under social security however the concept of mandatory retirement at any given age under privatelysponsored pen sion plans is coming under increasing fire from social scientists and others thus it is possible that congress may authorize a study of the mandatory retirement age concept which ultimately but not in  could be the basis for legislation affecting this provision of most pension plans the coming year is likely to bring adjustments in the medicare and medicaid areas due to the escalating costs of medical services there will be many proposals in the national health insurance area ranging from the equivalent of catastrophic illness coverage to complete coverage there will be considerable range too in the degree of employer financial support required under the various pro posals with the carter administration committed to action in this field enactment sooner or later of some national health insurance plan seems certain it could conceivably be enacted in  to be effective in  however in view of the cost consequences to the federal budget  and also with an eye to the most propitious timing politically  enactment could well be delayed until  cma  f osha developments upon his appointment as assistant secretary of labor for oc cupational safety and health a year ago morton corn immediately set about to make the occupational safety and health administration a more professional organization the perception of osha by the public government and industry at the time was highly unflattering morton corn has not yet succeeded in reversing that view but is determined to do so he has made headway toward making osha a more comp tent organization if he remains in the office under the carter administration he will continue to increase the technical competence of the osha staff to work for reorganization of the agency and to seek cooperation from both labor and industry in setting standards in short morton corn is making osha a new and different kind of organization the full impact of these changes on industry is yet to be known but steppedup activity on a more professional level is certain i osha has a proposal under consideration to allow certain compani s to establish their own federallyapproved safety programs as proposed this program would establish three groups of employers those who would be required to comply with osha standards those who could deviate from osha standards on a standardbystandard basis and those who could establish their own safety programs after a probationary period oshas examination of this proposed program apparently was generated by a finding that  of all deaths and injuries in industry are not attributable to violations of osha specification or performance standards the proposed program is aimed at encouraging companies not only to meet osha standards but to have a safety education and training program to have sufficient qualified safety personnel to have employee participation in the safety program etc whether or not a company adequately meets these and other criteria would of course be decided by osha com panies given less than the top rating by osha could expect to hear from their employees and their unions equal employment opportunity a supreme court decision mcdonald vs santa fe transportation affirmed that white persons may seek relief under title vii for racial discrimination the court rules that the terms of title vii are not limited to discrimination against members of any particular race and that the  civil rights act was meant to state a broad principle of racial quality that applies equally to whites and blacks this decision makes it likely that white employees espe cially thos who have personally lost out because of affirmative action will become bolder in filing charges still to be con sidered is the qu stion of whether or not mandated affirmative i cma  action constitutes bias against whites in franks vs bowman transportation the supreme court ruled that an employee should be credited with a seniority date back to his original date of application as a remedy for a proven title vii violation although title vii expressly permits bona fide seniority to rule in employment decisions the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc asserts that no seniority system can be bona fid if it deprives a disproportionate number of protectedclass members of employment this issue is still pending on remand to the third circuit by the u s court jersey central power  light case n w office of federal contract compliance programs ofccp regulations on veterans employment and revised regulations on handicapped persons employment were issued defining the obliga tions of federal contractors and subcontractors to take affirma tive action for the covered classes proposed revision of regulations for enforcing executive order  aroused controversy because a number of civil rights groups see these as less demanding than present regulations many industry representatives in fact prefer the present regulations the pro posed revisions would allow ofccp to investigate individual charges of discrimination such as presently handled by eeoc under title vii and to assess back pay for classes where disparate treatment is found by ofccp the issue whether  authorizes backpay demands is currently in litigation mca on the recommendation of its industrial relations advisory committee joined other employers and employer associations in funding the work of the recentlyestablished equal employment advisory committee this unique organization fills two roles critical to the employer community not filled by any other organization pation on an amicus curiae basis in significant litigation when im portant employer positions are at issue the council has participated in more than  such cases in the last two years and  undertaking and publishing demographic and other studies to assist employers in complying with thelaw and spirit of the equal employment opportunity laws this organization is effectively fulfilling its assigned mission and our continued support is important and recommended university relations and college recruitment statistics based on the analysis of information received from since  the number of chemists graduating from college has held fairly constant but the number of chemical engineers has been declining aiche acs and the engineers joint council indicate that cma  r since  therefore a shortage of chemical engineers is expent for at least the next couple of years j some recent statistics however indicate a rather notable switchover of sophomores and juniors into engineering disciplines which might end the shortage of chemical engineers sooner than anticipated i female bs chemistry graduates in  amounted to  of the total graduating this increased to  in  female chemical engineering graduates increased from  in  to minority chemical engineers are still extremely few and will amount to slightly more than  of the total graduates in  international labor organization for a number of years members of our committee have maintained contact with the ilo through the international chemical employers labor relations committee which is in effect the caucus for ilo purposes of chemical employers throughout the world this year was of particular importance because there was held in february in geneva an ilo chemical industries committee meeting the first since  like all ilo meetings this was organized on a tripartite basis  with labor management and government representatives some  nations took part in the committee meeting each delegation consisting of two from management two from labor and two from government david c williams of the mca staff and i were the u s management representatives two areas of discussion were assigned to the meeting the chemical industries and their working environment and the manpower aspects of establishing chemical industries in developing countries the report of the meeting is on file at the mca office in both areas of discussion items of controversy between labor and manag ment arose with regard to the report on the working environ ment the employers successfully resisted a union drive for an endorsement of joint health and safety committees with decision making powers maintaining that they should have consultative functions only in the manpower report the employers successfully resisted a union drive for a statement discouraging the practice of contracting out or subcontracting jobs in particular contracts to provide labor cma  apart from their work on the reports the employers were also successful with the help of the american union delegates in killing a resolution offered by communists among the worker delegates seeking to launch an attack upon multinational corpora tions at this time it is problematical whether the united states will remain in the ilo however the chamber of commercewhich represents us management in the ilo has taken the position that so long as we are members we should be fully active particularly in seeking needed reforms this appears to me the proper position for mca to maintain nlrb developments the nlrb general counsel is having some success with his inter pretation of the freedom of information act the federal courts have held that an employer against whom unfair labor practice proce dings are pending before the nlrb is not entitled under the freedom of information act to the disclosure of statements of witnesses obtained by board agents during the course of the investi gation into the underlying charges there has been a plethora of litigation on this point the nlrb has won some and lost some however at this time the general counsel has prevailed inmost of the litigation the nlrb chairman appointed a task force about one year ago its job was to undertake a review and evaluation of the existing structure practices procedures rules and regulations for the investigation prosecution hearing decision and enforcement of cases filed with the national labor relations board the task force has been in existence for one year and appears to be doing a rather thorough job i cma  exhibit e report to the board of directors manufacturing chemists association george dominguez chairman chemical regulations advisory committee february   the chemical regulations advisory committee crac is most intensely active in preparing draft proposals for the environ mental protection agencys epa use through its office of toxic substances ots in drafting regulations and definitions required on a time schedule established by the toxic substances control act a series of weekly meetings provided epa with abbr viated views on basic concepts at epa public meetings december  and  prepared statements were read before an audi nee of  later statements were presented on more detailed sections and issues of the law before smaller epa sponsored meetings in midjanuary mca views were developed for presentation to epa on twelve records and reports issues delineated by epa in these and the weekly meetings the views presented were largely tentative but increasingly convergent i on workable understanding through interaction with epa as epa further clarifies its strategies this frequency of meetings is likely to increase to complete implementation in  as requir d by law the results of these sessions are manifest in changed epa positions for example epas earlier preference for a simple numerical limit to small quantities for research and develop ment has shifted to mcas view that flexibility is needed to reflect realistic dissimilarities between diverse industries and diff rent stages in research the agreed control is that the manufacture or processing of such varied quantities be supervised by professionally trained personnel informed about the health and safety aspects of the specific material still to be resolved is the procedure for distribution or disposal of plantscale trial quantities another example of progress is epas dropping its proposal that impurities of substances be reported with annual production volumes the epa staff finally agreed that its proposal would not meet costbenefit analysis cma   perhaps the most creative proposal tentatively accepted by epa is the system mca proposed to maintain confidentiality of the identity of certain substances considered to be bona fide trade secrets coding identities by qualitative empirical formula and molecular weight this proposal has earned initial support by environmentalists volunteer company members in addition to cracs member ship of thirty have been readily accepted at work group levels assuring effective mca representation in these frequent epa working sessions the january issue of mca news carries a story and picture of one of the work groups actively preparing posi tions on the development of the section b inventory list of existing chemicals simultaneously three regional seminars have been organized to help companies prepare for compliance the first of these was held february  in philadelphia pennsylvania and was highly successful in terms of attendance and of the number of searching questions asked you may wish to alert your mid and farwest associates of the next two meetings february  at st louis missouri and march  at san francisco california cma  exhibit f mca government relations committee report to the board of directors february   don a goodall chairman a major premise of this report is that business is not as influential in washington as we would like it to be nor as influential as we must be if any viable form of private enterprise is to be preserved in this country it was not too many years ago that businessmen were listened to with considerable attention by those members of congress who wore either a republican or southern demo crat label but that is no longer the case what happened when i first came to washington in  one of the power houses on the hill was judge smith of virginia am id school southern democrat and head of the then allpowerful house rules committee if he decided he didnt want a bill passed he wouldnt give it a rule permitting it to go to the house floor if the pressure got too gr at he just went down to his farm to  as he used to im not saying this was the right way to run the government but it was a time when businessmen had more influence in congress than we have today but that day went out with the oneman onevote drive that took place more than a decade ago and for a variety of other reasons for example the politicizing of labor unions was another contributing factor beginning in  with estab lishment of the committee on political education labor moved into the political ring in a big way convinced that it could win in state legislatures and the congress what it could not win at the bargaining table labor money and labor manpower are now major factors in congres sional election campaigns and labors lobbying muscle on capitol hill is the envy of those of us on the business side i television is another factor that has changed the process of selecting and influencing members of congress the medium puts a premium on an appearance of freshness f youthful vigor and vitality and on the ability to articulate ideas furth rmore the wide exposure tv gives cma  to candidates tends to open up the selection process another and more recent development has been the rise of public interest groups they are dedicated and per severing a member of congress must be responsive to their pressures or else hell find himself facing more competition for his seat in the next primary and general elections business has not been totally unresponsive to these changing factors with the rise of big government and big labor after wwii some large companies opened wash ington offices to assure that their views were being conveyed to congress and the administration at the same time that the washington corporate office was being developed by a relative handful of companies  must add there was a parallel development of the trade association as an instrument for communicating with government in the last two decades trade associations have become as much a washington growth phenomenon as government itself and finally within the last few years we have even seen the ceo coming to washington to engage in direct lobbying where an issue was of such paramount importance to the corporation that it merited his personal attention this technique became so important in fact that the business roundtable was formed expressly to assure organized ceo involvement in the lobbying effort but the washington corporate office and the trade association and the ceo as lobbyists are not totally responsive to todays need what business lacks is a grassroots voice many members of congress are candid in saying this to your washington corporate representative right or wrong members of congress are telling us that opinions from the corporate board room no longer carry the weight they once did in the vernacular of capitol hill they ask how many votes have you got unfortunately too many in business fail to under stand that to a politician the vote tally on election day tis the endall and beall in the same manner as is to you the bottom line on your corporate financial statement i cma   how do we get a grassroots voice on capitol hill we start by developing two resources that presently are largely untapped by business  employees and stockholders first we give our employees an understanding of how our businesses work an understanding of the kind of governmental climate that must exist for preservation of private enterprise and an understanding of how their personal welfare relates to that of the corporation lest anyone assume that this is not a bonafide need i quote from the january issue of the conference board magazine which said of the american people  they misunderstand the relationships between prices and costs and between real wages productivity and capital invest ment they overestimate the level of corporate profit margins and they believe that it is business not people who pays the corporate income tax if we help our employees understand these things then they will see that their congressional representatives understand them the stockholder is not so much in need of economic ducation as he is of being informed about how prospective government actions will affect the return on his investment once he has that information communication with congress will take care of itself let me illustrate what im saying with a true story it involves burt talcott a seventerm member of the house of representatives from california until his defeat last november mr talcott voted in line with the business community position on issues about  percent of the time conversely labor gave him only a  percent favorable vote rating in october  a delegation of california businessmen met with the california congressional delegation to express its views on then pending legislation afterwards mr talcott wrote to these businessmen let me quote from that letter as representatives of the people w cannot in a practical or political sense support an issue or a cma  bill without support of people  the people we directly represent we need support as you need a market your aim must be the people there is no easy way to leapfrog them to persuade a group of leg islators you can you must begin by persuading your employees  vour investors who are our constituents they pack the political clout they can be mobilized but i as a legislator cannot do it  at least without vour help perhaps one of your union leaders should have appeared with you one union leader would have impressed more than half of our delegation mr talcotts advice to the california businessmen was echoed by rep barber conable of new york one of the brightest and most capable members of the house when he spoke not long ago to a group of pfizer management personnel he counselled pfizer to talk to its own people so that they would understand why mr conable takes the positions he does without such backup mr conable is vulnerable mr talcotts reference to a union leader doesnt mean that union leaders are more persuasive than businessmen it simply means that from a congressmans perception union spokesmen presently represent more votes than we do that perception is certainly true in mr talcotts case hes no longer in congress thanks to labor union and environmentalist political clout bryce harlow counsellor to presidents and procter  gambles washington representative has an interesting concept of this matter of perceptions he says that when a politician looks at you as a company executive or me as a washington representative or at mca he looks through us  as though we were a window he wants to see what is behind us to determine if we can hurt him or help him too often the politician sees nothing behind us and when he does he knows he can ignore our views cma   sd much then for the need for grassroots support if our positions are to prevail in washington it is not my intent nor have we time for the mechanics of how this will be accomplished except that it will not be done by slick pr tech niques nor by writing a check once a year to some organiza tion that promises you it can educate the american public about free enterprise now let me shift focus to another subject but which is related to all that lve said so far like one side of a coin is related to the other business cannot be persuasive either to its own employees or to congress if it lacks credibility and business has a credibility problem stemming from such things as price fixing bribery and environmental incidents i do not believe that except for a few amoral businessmen todays corporate leaders consciously condone breaking the law rather these things happen because not enough attention is paid to establishing controls that will prevent them and so i make this suggestion that every company have a system of internal auditing which has the express purpose of identifying for management potential problem areas within the corporation xt is my belief that somewhere in any company there are always individuals who know when the fine line of illegality is being crossed or some practice is being followed that is questionable from an environmental safety or health view there must be a way for these people to report their concerns so that management can take corrective steps before irre trievable damage is done  both to the company and to the business image im not advocating dogoodism gulfs ceo announced recently that it has set up a system that gives its divi sional finance officers an opportunity to report problem another mca company xm told has recently insti tuted an auditing procedure in the health and safety area so this is a practical suggestion cma  in summary i have suggested to you that we should do two things to help preserve private enterprise first enlist the participation of our employees and stockholders and second establish an internal method for identifying potential problem areas if you feel that these sugges tions have merit the government relations conmittee is ready to work with you in designing a model program which you can adapt to your own operations iyyi i i i i i cma  exhibit d report by the director of government relations william m stover april   congress in recess but activity continues at high level the congress is currently in a district work period a term now used to describe the easter recess from which they return next monday april  there has been much recent activity however and more important work awaits the taxation portion of the presidents economic stimulus program has been approved by the house and the senate committee version is now ready for th floor amendments to both the air quality and water quality laws are approaching the latter stages of consideration both the s nate and house have recently approved detailed codes of ethics govern ing the conduct of the members labor has sustained a surprising defeat in house rejection of common situs picketing legislation a defeat which raises questions about the carter administrations relationship with organized labor and prospects for other laborbacked bills at the white house the activity has been equally intense the president recently signed into law the government reorganiz ation bill he has long sought a comprehensive administration proposal on election reform has been sent to the congress in the near future mr carter is expected to send three more major messages to capitol hill one dealing with inflation another on his national energy program and a third on the environment energy and environmental messages expected soon according to mental message to preliminary draft public the final the original timetable the presidents environ congress was due on april  but although a from the council on environmental quality became text has not been issued cma  i  t i moreover there are signs that the delay is due at least in part to potential conflicts with elements of another major presidential program  the energy message scheduled to be delivered by the president april  the close interrelationship and tradeoffs between energy and environmental concerns are well recognized as is the political volatility of each factors which may have led to late modifications the draft environmental message written for the president by ceq centers around  issues oil pollution prevention air and water pollution control protection of life and health resource conservation and recovery assessment and improvement of environmental laws energy natural resources living resources global environment urban environment and parks recreation and wilderness early reports on the initial page draft indicated that it offered little in the way of compromises or tradeoffs in the interest of increased energy supply the energy message has apparently undergone some revision in recent days with rumors of a move away from mandatory acrosstheboard efficiency standards for industry and toward efficiency standards for industrial equipment by working with the manufacturers regardless it is certain that the mandatory approach is still favored by some vocal and influential members of congress and that voluntary industrial efficiency programs or conservation efforts will come under attack the carter plan is also expected to call for a retrofit program to weatherize homes performancebase building codes for new building types and energyefficiency standards for large appliances other possibilities include a surtax on gasguzzling vehicles higher fuel economy goals for new cars and a standby increase in the federal gasoline tax petroleum controls will probably continue and vigorous efforts are likely to reduce the use of natural gas as a fuel mca task group preparing program on water quality legislation looking ahead toward future opportunities for needed amendment of the federal water pollution control act an mca task group has developed an action plan which will soon be launched this program is the work of the mca intercommittee task group on water quality legislation which is chaired by sam pickard vice president of monsanto with william s sneath chairman of the board of union carbide acting as senior advisor the aim is to marshal the communications skills local impact and pertinent data of the chemical industry so as to present a compelling case to the congress when major water quality legislation is next concma  j  t   sidered no dates are presently set for congressional review but we are moving aggressively now both to insure our preparedness and to add impetus to the amending effort itself i the focal point of the task groups work is this there is a need to evaluate current and projected accomplishments in cleaning up the nations waters before moving on to the  requirement for installation of best available technology controls we believe and will argue that once the  standards best practicable technology are met by all sectors it may not be in the national interest to proceed to the technologybased  standards in all cases t and so the multifaceted action program being readied places its stress on our industrys commitment to achieving fishable swimmable waters by   and fishable swimmable waters is the stated goal of the federal water pollution control act pl  i i i i i the active program of communications preparation and datacollection drafted by our task group will be set in motion this month by a letter from mr driver to the executive contacts of mca member companies here is its outline it encourages active participation of ceos middlemanagers and employees by providing readytouse inform ation  speech material articles for publications data analyses etc it encourages development of specific local data by each company  perhaps even at each location  which will be readily compiled readily understandable and readily applied to our basic arguments it encourages dialogue with a broad range of constituencies and publics including congressmen local communities public interest groups labor the media and others i i j while not acertainty we believe there is a possibility for  constructive amendment of the federal water pollution control act  during the th congress if we are to have a reasonable opportunity i to achieve a measure of midcourse correction it is essential that i all member companies respond vigorously  taxes and the economic stimulus i on monday march  the senate finance committee filed the i report on its version of the taxation aspects of president carters economic stimulus program h r  the tax reduction and simplificma   cation act of  there is uneasiness about the vote count how ever and the senate leadership deferred floor consideration until after easter recess the key question appears to be the  tax rebate but an additional complication is the apparent backlash among democratic members who resent mr carters recent cuts in state water projects insofar as industry is concerned the major differences between house and senate bills thus far are in the tax incentives area the house version provides only for a new jobs credit of  for each new employee with a ceiling of  credit for each company the senate version gives companies an option to take a new jobs credit somewhat similar to the one in the house bill or to choose the investment tax credit increased from  to  the option was contained in the original administration proposal a major floor fight is of course expected on the  tax rebate but another key question will be senator javits expected amendment to substitute a permanent reduction in personal income taxes for the rebate this approach should receive solid support from the  senate republicans but it is doubtful that enough democrats will join in mr carter has hinted a veto of any bill  containing a tax reduction because the administration considers that a central part of its reform package expected this fall conservative democrats may sponsor an amendment to delete the rebate without substituting any permanent tax reduction another floor amendment fight could arise over a bill intro duced by senator frank church s  which would terminate the deferral of taxation of foreign source income there is a good possiblity that he may propose the substance of this bill as an amendment to the tax reduction and simplification act during floor consideration if senator church does introduce his deferral amendment there is a real danger that it may carry last year a similar amendment was defeated by the margin of a single vote since the house defeated the common situs picketing bill many senators as well as representatives are anxious for an opportunity to cast a prolabor vote labor is on record opposing the deferral concept contending it encourages the export of jobs and so the church amendment might furnish senators an opportunity to mend their labor fences we have alerted the members of our government relations and tax policy committees asking that they urge senators with whom they have a constituent relationship to vote against such an amendment cma   status of the arab boycott situation there are two important areas of activity with respect to the arab boycott situation the first being in existing tax law under the tax reform act of  the socalled ribicoff amendment denied various tax benefits to companies participating in or cooperating with an international boycott the treasury depart ment has subsequently issued two sets of guidelines relating to the boycott provisions of the ct our tax policy committee has studied these guidelines and is of the opinion that both the boycott provisions of the tax reform act and the guidelines themselves need further clarification we have therefore arranged for a meeting april  with treasury officials to discuss the problem on april  irs is holding a public hearing on the guidelines we expect either to request to testify or to submit a statement at that hearing and will determine which approach to take after our meeting with treasury the second area in which the arab boycott question is being discussed is in pending amendments to the export administration act the house international relations committee and the senate banking committee have both reported bills amending the export administration act to prohibit u s companies from participating in foreign boycotts the senate banking committee ordered s  reported on april  and expects to bring it to the floor soon after the easter recess the house international relations committee reported a clean bill hr  on april  and will request a rule on april  house floor consideration is expected soon thereafter though similar the antiboycott provisions of the house and senate bills have some differences the senatebill would provide an exception for u s firms operating in boycotting countries allowing them to comply with local law with respect to activities exclusively within those countries the house bill contains no such provision the house bill will allow u s persons to comply with a boycotters designation of a u s transaction provided that this exception would not apply in cases where the u s firm has actual knowledge that the sole purpose of the designation is to implement the boycott the senate provision on unilateral selection contains no such limitation cma   the carter government reorganization plan on april  president carter signed into public law a major government reorganization bill thus moving toward fullfillment of a principal campaign promise reorganization of the sprawling and overlapping federal bureaucracy every president since hoover has had reorganization authority but the law was allowed to expire on april   because of the watergate controversy and congressional displeasure over what it considered usurpation of power by the executive branch during hearings in the house government operations committee chairman jack brooks dtx was adamantly opposed to giving the president this power without a tight congressional leash he wanted a bill which would require congressional approval of any proposed reorganization plan brooks claimed the legislative veto approach was unconstitutional the president has veto power congress the power to override president carter however succeeded in convincing government operations committee members of the need for reorganization powers much the same as those held by preceding presidents brooks was forced to relent and the house eventually passed the bill on march  by a vote of  the senate had no problem with the reorganization issue and passed its bill march  by a vote of  differences were quickly resolved in the joint conference and the following provisions became law  presidential authority to submit government reorganization plans for three years from enactment date  plans to be effective automatically unless either house vetoes within  days following submission  senate governmental affairs and the house government operations committees have jurisdiction over all plans  congress may not amend a plan  the president estimates cost increases or reductions or each plan and expected improvement in efficiency  a resolution of disapproval is to be introduced auto matically as the president submits a plan the resolution would go to each government operations committee and if not reported within  days it would be automatically discharged whereupon any member could then call it up cma   the president may amend a plan within  days of submission or withdraw it within  days  each plan deals with only one area of logically consistent subject matter  no more than three plans may be before the congress at any one time  plans may not abolish merge or create departments or independent regulatory agencies nor abolish functions mandated by statute or extend or expand functions  the intent of congress is expressed that the public should be involved in reorganization plans during the billsigning ceremony president carter said the reorganization of his own executive office would be the first order of business and that he hoped to make it a model he said he would not submit any further reorganization plans before jun because it will be a long wellthoughtout process chemical forum may  features senate whip the senior u

board of directors manufacturing chemists association william r chalker chairman air quality committee april   it is a privilege to appear before you in discussing the activities of the air quality committee i will highlight a key problem with the clean air act and amendatory efforts point out flaws in the epa interpretive ruling on offset of hydrocarbons in nonattainment areas cite our involvement in the epa synthetic organic chemical industry study touch on our mca hydrocarbon control cost study and oxidant episode study and describe several new areas of coming concern the regulatory tempo in the air pollution field keeps rising but our objective remains the same  to get permits to con struct plants or modify existing ones expeditiously and within realistic environmental constraints in going down the permit trail the we face an everwidening array of regulations and concepts decisions of control agencies are transcending their past areas of concern and are influencing such widely different facets as land use life style industrial production techniques and return on investment it is amazing that we have coped as w  as we have with this complex situation oxidant air quality standard and control strategy the oxidant or ozone air quality standard is the focal point of much of our current dilemma there are those who say there is too much ozone near the ground and there are those who say there is not enough in the stratosphere all we have to do is restructure the atmosphere  our problems are just about that complex and the outcome just about that unclear you received a briefing on the houston area oxidant study from mr files and others at your board meeting last month our committee thinks it is an important study and one that epa will not be able to ignore i believe it will be useful to emphasize several as pects of the oxidant problem cma  epa s oxidant standard is being exceeded in every state that has taken measurements it is not a texas problem alone few believe in the standard including dr knelson director of epas health effects research laboratory the api petition to epa which mca supports questions the standard and the con trol strategy to attain the standard best evidence indicates the standard will not be changed significantly however epa strategy to attain the standard is being tightened and will require offsets for new sources for example new hydrocarbon emissions located in areas where the oxidant standard is not being met must somehow accomplish reductions in existing emis sions to more than offset the added emissions this problem and epas proposed offset solution are the result of clean air act language mr polzers recent testimony on behalf of mca before the senate and house strongly emphasized the need for relief if orderly development in the nation is to continue actually we are on strong technical ground in saying that oxidant is relatively insensitive to changes in hydrocarbons and that hydrocarbons cannot be controlled sufficiently in most places to attain the oxidant standard los angeles is a prime example in  years that county has reduced hydro carbons from stationary source emissions by  and from vehicles last year they exceeded the oxidant standard on over  days epa knows we cannot attain the standard in many places but their new strategy is to make progress towards it by attempt ing to reduce high oxidant concentrations in large metropolitan areas and hence reduce the numbers of people at risk this philosophy agrees with mcas recent congressional testimony urging congress to modify the zero risk concept currently in herent in the act there is technical evidence that we can make progress but at enormous cost to control stationary sources and by imposition of drastic curtailment of vehicles by an unwilling public there are potential environmental hazards however to epa emphasis on hydrocarbon controls the de emphasis on controlling oxides of nitrogen a partner in photo chemical reactions can cause the smog problem to spread further into rural areas and lead to a buildup of oxides of nitrogen and pose yet another potential health risk this is precisely what is happening in the areas contiguous to los angeles mca has conveyed to epa our committees belief that hydrocarbon offset is unworkable cma  while some adjustments in offset requirements now appear likely epa is not abandoning its broader thesis and has no tified  states to revise their hydrocarbon control regulations by mid we face public hearings in all these states pres ently it is unclear if or how the association should handle these individual states i certainly recommend we gear up to handle regional problems such as the  northeastern states cur rently banding together to write uniform hydrocarbon standards clean air act amendments while i have mentioned problems with nonattainment of the oxidant standard and offsets we have concerns with other as pects of the clean air act mca has been most active in testi fying writing and visiting congressmen and in meeting with their staffs to seek all the amendments proposed in mr polzers testimony at the moment the situation is too fluid to say more than we are cautiously optimistic that some of our concerns are being heard and dealt with synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry study another area of concern to us is the epa study of the synthetic organic chemical industry their purpose is to develop federal new source performance standards and guide line documents for states to use in developing retrofit regu lations for existing sources this is a two to three year effort epas reasons for this study are that organics form photochemical oxidants and organics are toxic with some being carcinogenic epa states that synthetic organic chemicals contribute  of the total hydrocarbon emissions from stationary sources they state that control hinges primarily on proper plant design and operation that will require a depth of knowledge by epa of our operations that is unprecedented we have set up a task group to handle this and to coordinate with socma a total of about  chemicals will be studied a first meeting of our task group with epa was held on january  almost immediately the orderly procession of this program was upset to handle benzene on an emergency basis because of strong criticism against epa by the environmental defense fund that benzene was cma  a significant health hazard and a carcinogen a special mca task group to handle this item alone met with epa on february  since this is a single product response to epa is being made on an individual company basis eleven mca member companies are participating epa wants emission data ambient air data and views on control techniques etc attached to this presentation is a tentative list of the next nine chemicals and processes to be considered we are setting up task groups to handle them mca hydrocarbon control cost study  by foster d snell inc your companies have been in receipt of the foster d snell inc hydrocarbon control cost questionnaire for about three weeks al though it may not have reached your ears i am sure your people are fuming over it because it is comprehensive we have never at tempted anything to this depth before but then weve never faced  billion in investment cost for control of a single class of pollution before i use these cost figures with some confidence because my own company last year in a similar type study estimated an investment cost of  million to retrofit existing hydro carbon sources if the toughest projected pollution control regu lations were adopted in many cases this study is going to be an eye opener and hopefully haye valuable spinoff information for use in your individual companies  it will show we discharge a greater tonnage of hydrocarbons than we thought that we do not have a good estimate on emissions from a number of sources that likely the majority of our total poundage emissions derive from only a fraction of our total sources the results can force another look at raw material losses and perhaps spotlight more candidates for waste heat recovery further there is a new epa directive that all states prepare a hydrocarbon emission inventory by midyear finally management will be better able to judge the cost impact of proposed new hydrocarbon regulations lack of emission data last year posed a serious problem to the new jersey industrial advisory committee in evaluating at the request of the state the financial impact of the moodus conference model hydrocarbon regulation mca  oxidant episode study  by radian corporation the study of ambient air oxidant during high and low con centration periods and its relationship to the concentration of its principal precursors oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons cma  and their relationship in turn to hydrocarbon emissions in ten metropolitan areas is proceeding on schedule results are expected this summer atmospheric dispersion modeling proposed amendments to the clean air act call for the use of atmospheric dispersion modeling for use in evaluating sig nificant deterioration nonattainment etc argonne national laboratory held a specialist conference for epa in february to develop consensus models to be issued to the states as a further tool to evaluate permits our committee had representation and when the effort becomes more crystallized we will consider holding a workshop new areas of concern epa is revising the six existing air quality standards and will be adding new ones our committee will need medical and epidemiological input if we are to react part of our problem today eg on oxidants may be that our association and others were not in a position to comment vigorously when the several standards were set six years ago unless you object it is my intention to seek a nucleus of medical representation from your companies to determine the feasibility of a rebuttal a second item needing medical input is advice on the concentrations in the community environment that are considered safe for all our chemicals the current procedure is to use the osha standards and arbitrarily take a percentage of them and call this safe for the public we will have to do better than this for benzene acrylonitrile and eventually all the rest we would plan to us your aforementioned medical representatives to guide our com mittee in this crucial area also a third item is that relatively little attention has been paid by control agencies to our emissions during startup and shutdowns emergency releases and fugitive losses various estimates indicate they may be as large as our normal emissions and control agencies are starting to note this we anticipate greater regulatory attention to these types of emissions some questions of this type appear in our hydrocarbon cost study cma  conclusions in conclusion i understand the board approved adding a general counsel to the mca staff despite the strength of present staff support we welcome this and being pushy hope the time will come when an environmental lawyer is also hired lastly the system wouldnt work without the major contributions of our committee members i appreciate your making this pos sible even so we sometimes feel like a platoon fighting an army thank you cma  attachment epa synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry study epa very recently identified the following products and processes as the first for which federal new source perfor mance

million of which   million related to special proj ects he emphasized that with budget amendments this year we currently have budgeted revenues of    and total budget expenses of    assuming no further budget changes we are looking forward to a budget deficit of  at the end of this fiscal year the monthly treasurers report for the period june    october   will be mailed with the board minutes finance committee report as chairman mr burrell reviewed the activities of the finance com mittee in addressing the impact on expenses resulting from the reorganization of mca to date this would create the expected deficit of  mention ed by mr herrman as a result of additional funding approved by the executive committee this could increase to a deficit of   if contemplated additional requests from mca standing committees were approved two cma   alternatives for financing the deficit were presented to the executive com mittee  funding from reserves or levying a special assessment in the former approach a deficit of  million would reduce reserves to  of the operating budget while reserves would drop to  with a deficit of   million as against the general criteria the association has followed of a reserve of about  with the special assessment approach at a reserve level of  a deficit of  million would require a special assessment of  of current dues for each member and a deficit of  million would re quire a special assessment of  the finance committee unanimously recommended to the executive committee that the fiscal year  deficit should be funded by utilization of mcas reserves with the criteria that the operating reserves could not fall below the  level this was approved by the executive committee mr donley then reviewed the reorganization of mca its enhanced advocacy role and the increased commitments of member companies in providing strong people to the new committees in order to enable the association to respond effectively to the increased pressures of governmental action he solicited response from the board and all member com panies to the increased communications which will emanate from mca so that the associations activities can best reflect the interests of the industry i proposed amendment to the bylaws mr barackman advised that proposed bylaws amendments enclosed with the notice of meeting would effect the necessary changes resulting from splitting the functions of the secretarytreasurer approved by the executive committee on motion duly made and seconded it was voted that the proposed amendments to the bylaws as set fourth in exhibit b be approved report of chairman of the board mr donleys report is attached as exhibit c association activities mr rolands report follows the chairmans report is the first of a series of quarterly reports which will be published to the entire mca membership cma   in the public relations area we had  company experts at the national association of farm broadcasters convention in kansas city on hand to discuss  topics  broadcasters taped  radio shows to be aired over nearly  radio stations covering about  of the united states the programs cost of reaching one person varies with audience size and ranges from less than one and a half cents to a thousandth of a cent  in a visit with alfred kahn chairman of the council on wage and price stability cowps he said he was against wageprice controls and would work for more effective and economical government in the framework of regulatory reform because he indicated a willingness to do so a meeting with mr kahn together with mr barry bosworth director of cowps has been requested at which time the chemical in dustry problems as embodied in the economic and regulatory profile developed for the recent meeting with commerce secretary kreps would be discussed  especially in light of the fact that the selection of  as base years for profits and prices was unfortunate for many companies meanwhile mr kahn asks for industry support of the announced wageprice guidelines  another area of concern is chemical industry coordination with other associations to effect this the new position of director of association liaison is being established within mca this move has been applauded by some  associations with whom it has been discussed the director will be responsible for communicating information regarding mcas positions activities and needs to other relevant industry trade associations and groups while providing mca with similar information from them  the words manufacturing chemists association dont accurately reflect the membership of the industry association for todays man in the street the name chemical manufacturers association cma conveys the idea that the association is made up of corporations rather than persons who make the commodity chemicals the executive committee supports this name change the matter will be placed on the agenda for the january board meeting the executive committee recommends that if approved by the board the entire membership then be polled for their reaction  mr roland concluded his report with a description of the program planned for the day following the board meeting government relations report mr stovers report distributed at the meeting is attached as exhibit d during his report he reviewed in detail the meeting with commerce secretary kreps and chemical industry spokesmen and also called attention to the importance of the question of oil price regulation regarding the latter cma  mca has testified on the pricing issue on numerous occasions in support of any actions which permit petroleum prices to rise to world levels through decontrol or phased removal of price controls this would en able primary energy prices to reflect replacement costs and provide the maximum incentive to develop new resources and expand the supply base at the conclusion of mr stovers report mr foveaux discussed the administrations antiinflation program headed by alfred kahn chair man of cowps he also described the establishment of an mca task group charged with monitoring developments in the wageprice area guiding companies to sources of information proposing mca responses as appropriate and recommending them for approval at the proper level and coordinating communications as they are needed report by general counsel mr frosts report is attached as exhibit e business item report of membership committee as chairman mr polzer reported the committees having examined the qualifications of the company named below and recommended its election on motion duly made and seconded it was voted that hatco chemical corporation be elected to membership in the association new business mr donley advised that the chairmans quarterly report to the board of directors would be distributed to all member companies mr morley expressed concern about proposals developing in the mca occupational safety and health committee for the identification of chronic hazards on sample labels appearing in mca safety data sheets since safety data sheet labels could be considered in some quarters as an industry standard he felt that there was a serious risk that even minor defects could lead to costly but unnecessary testing for every product marketed by a company he wanted to be sure that proposed chronic hazard labeling guidelines received appropriate review by all of those member companies pvith representatives serving on the committees and task groups with respon sibilities related to labeling he was assured by mr roland that the report of the occupational safety and health committee whichhas the responsibility in this area will be given the widest possible consideration including review by other relevant committees and that all the input necessary for a good  work product will be considered by that committee and by the staff vited comments from anyone having a concern in this matter mr henske expressed the view that in two years if we continue on our present course mcas budget will be about double the current fiscal years budget mca has become more active which costa money if there are any reservations or questions about where the association is headed they should be communicated between now and spring at which time decisions concerning next years budget will be made we are headed for a material increase in the costs of running mca comments

congress in october brought a mass of legislation which we are still studying for its relevance to the chemical industry the national energy program of course is the most important of these lastminute bills because of the wideranging and continuing impact it will have but amid the closing rush were other signal successes for mca and the industry they were treated extensively in a special federal legislative bulletin and a special insert to mca news but their names bear repeating here section  superfund tsca amendments energy reporting the successes were the result of close cooperation among all staff members it is this kind of cooperation this kind of activity that will mark the spirit of the new ad vocacy role mca has begun to play the agenda for the next quarter is full the resource con servation and recovery act certain aspects of the toxic substances control act pretreatment regulations preven tion of significant deterioration regulations state implem entation plans on air pollution product liability legislation and more never it seems has there been so much to do and never has the association been in better condition to do it the reorganization is working and the more tightly structured committees and staff are responding with renewed spirit to the tasks facing them edward donley chairman of the board cma  technical department chemical regulations advisory committee mca has made every effort to make clear to epa that overly strict rules under section  premanufacturing and processing notices can obstruct innovation if demands for health safety and marketing information go beyond the statutory need to establish that there is no unreasonable risk economic impacts task group a oneyear  pilot study on the economic impact of the toxic substances control act tsca was begun with the signing of an agreement with national economic research associates inc the primary objectives are to establish a method for measuring the economic impact of tsca on the chemical industry and the us economy to impact epa during the regulatory development process and to impact congress for regulatory reform over the next few months the actual survey questionnaire will be developed and pretested on a small group of member companies distribution committee mca is asking appropriate member companies if they accept the railroads proposal for a new tank car mileage allowance system that would increase compensation by almost twothirds in three years approval by mca member companies and other parties to the proceeding seems certain mca will file a statement noting that a proposal to change truck drivers hours of service might actually increase accidents the proposal of the transportation departments bureau of motor carrier safety will increase costs by  percent in an interstate commerce commission proceeding on increased freight rates and charges mca has filed a statement contending that the rail rates on six chemical product groups were already too high mca plans to file a similar state ment on future railroad freight rate increase proposals that would raise chemical freight rates energy conservation committee the latest energy conservation report for the period june  to june  to the department of energy was presented to the press at a luncheon on november  with robert a roland as host also distributed to the press were mca replies to the general accounting offices reporting program and the energy information administrations report to congress that could give congress the impression that a more legislation and regulation are needed to accomplish what already is being accomplished the committee is working on tentative industry positions on the national energy act and has discussed coal conversion regulations with the does economic regulatory cma  administrator on december  the committee will conduct a seminar for doe on cost determination in the chemical industry engineering advisory committee the engineering advisory committee

pretreatment regulations prevention of significant deterioration regulations content of pending revisions to state implementation plans health effects of air quality water quality criteria toxic pollutant sampling and new economic perspectives on environmental regulations the committee also developed a program for combined technical and legal actions to prepare the bases for responding to  critical regulations among  identified of importance scheduled to be issued by the end of  in structuring this program the emc established  task groups compared to  under the old committee structure and reduced task group members to about  from more than  insurance committee on september  robert l mitchell of celanese corporation presented a statement before the sub committee on miscellaneous revenue measures of the house ways and means committee supporting the tax deductibility of reserves to pay product liability claims congress failed to act on legislation for reserve deductibility but instead enacted tax carryback provisions which will do little to alleviate pro duct liability claim problems occupational safety and health committee in a statement for mca before the subcommittee on labor of the senate committee on human resources on october  dr bruce w karrh medical director of the dupont company called on osha to work cooperatively with industry rather than taking punitive action to secure an injuryfree workplace cma in a posthearing brief submitted to osha mca said the agency exceeded its statutory authority in issuing its much debated carcinogen regulation proposal also reviewed were the need for riskbenefit analysis and points in support of the american industrial health council position a task group on chronic hazard labeling is drafting recommended guidelines for use in preparing exemplary labels in mca chemical safety data sheets at its meeting september  the occupational safety and health committee recommended that mca challenge the access to records portion of the final interim regulation promulgated by osha regarding exposure and medical records guidelines are being developed by a task group on this subject for the collection of health and industrial hygiene information to be used in epidemi ologic studies the use of such guidelines by member companies would help assure compatibility of the data when such studies are undertaken guidelines also are being developed on the evaluation classifi cation risk assessment and control of chemical teratogens as well as control of embryotoxic agents in the workplace by still another task group of the committee special projects fluorocarbons significant progress has been made in the fluorocarbon research program administered by mca towards its goal of determining the effects of these materials upon the atmosphere sufficient data and knowledge of the chemistry involved from studies completed to date have made it possible to begin development of a multidimensional computer model of the role of fluorocarbons in the atmosphere at its september  meeting the technical panel on fluorocarbon research approved proposals for the continued operation of the atmospheric lifetimes experiment this project is designed to determine the residence time of fluorocarbons in the troposphere and in combination with the computer modeling activity will yield valuable information about the lifetimes of fluorocarbons in the atmosphere four stations analyze ambient air continu ously for species of interest the fluorocarbon research program provided  to establish these stations and to begin operations in early  the program provided an additional cma   on september  to operate the stations and to analyze data for the second year of the experiment other ongoing studies of particular importance are the development of a method of analysis for total chlorine in the stratosphere and catalytic destruction of fluorocarbons in the troposphere by airborne dust and sand particles proposals for trend analysis of ozone concentration joining the rela tively new satellite observations with an extensive set of groundbased data are presently under consideration in the panel phosgene the technical panel on phosgene safety met on octo ber  to complete action on  agenda items among the more important of these were six investigative proposals five of these are concerned with retrospective mortality studies retrospective pulmonary studies and a prospective onsite study in a member company wherein the phosgene unit is relatively isolated from other suspect exposures the sixth project under considera tion is a longterm lowlevel inhalation study j j j i titanium dioxide the tabershaw occupational medicine associates pa have in progress a feasibility analysis for an

have brought a significant increase in the scope of mcas legal advisory program the successful litigation in the western district of louisiana against epas regulations under section  of the clean water act was the first major case brought by mca more recently mca joined the american petro leum institute and the american iron and steel institute in successfully challenging oshas benzene

regulation oshas proposed medical records retention regulations consumer product safety commissions cancer regulation epas tsca regulations epas clean water act permit regulations and epas resource and recovery act regulations this broad scope of advocacy is not jis t legal argument rather it integrates legal and technical advocacy with mca counsel working closely with mca committees and tech nical staff not all of the advocacy is litigation in the case of section  regulations successful litigation paved the way for a more permanent settlement negotiated with epa and implemented by legislative amendment the section  negotiation has in turn provided the opportunity for what may be very meaningful highlevel negotiations concerning rcra and liabilities related to solid waste disposal public relations and education environmental information in addition to continuing to pro vide news on environmental and occupational health matters cma  chemecology addressed three major issues of importance to the industry during this quarter transportation safety was the theme in the august issue in september chemecology was careful to provide facts about the lov canal incident which most of the media chose to ignore this helped to put that issue much more in its proper perspec tive several articles in the october issue emphasized the growing realization that riskbenefit is more than a concept it is a fact of life for example the national research coun cil says that the benefits of nitrogen fertilizers outweigh their possible risk to the ozone layer and a federal court struck down a workplace standard for benzene on the basis that its cost exceeded potential benefits to employees during this period  additional thought and opinion leaders voluntarily asked to be added to our mailing list bringing total chemecology circulation to  three toxic substances management memos were issued on sec tions  and d of the toxic substances control act and on the associations economic impact study of the act at the same time the circulation of the memos has been expanded and opened to anyone in the industry with a need to know environmental information was made available

the results of the latest enery report to doe in a page booklet in addition to the figures a statement by mr roland and a narrative section on how the industry did it filled out the publication the booklet will get wide dis tribution but its primary audience will be the hill and the bureaucrats in doe the section wrote and edited some of the materials that went into the work book for the department of commerce briefing by the industry on november  the section also prepared this report j chemical industry councils and similar groups have expressed great interest in having mr roland speak to them the new mca president spoke to the louisiana and texas chemical as sociations in this past quarter and he is scheduled to speak to the los angeles and northern california groups in november and to the midwest cic in the spring i cma  exhibit d manufacturing chemists association report by the director of government relations william m stover november   administration launches wageprice guidelines program president carter on october  unveiled his antiinflation plan in a personal appeal on television it contained three elements a voluntary wageprice program a promise to reduce the federal budget deficit a proposed tax rebate to workers receiving less of a pay increase than the seven percent guide lines  i i on october  alfred e kahnv chairman of the civil aeronautics ard was named chairman of the council on wage and price stability he is a yearold economist with broad experience in and out of government his many years as professor at cornell were interspersed with middlelevel government positions in the eisenhower kennedy and johnson administrations he also was a staff economist at the thinktank brookings institute there seems to be a broad acceptance of kahn with little or no criticism of president carters choice t the cowps was immediately expanded from  staffers to  by transfer from other agencies its offices are located a block from the white house in the new executive office building the emphasis on prices to date is on an individual company basis little or nothing is being done as yet on an industry basis four hundred companies with sales over  million will be closely monitored major companies in groups of ten were called in as early as november  to discuss compliance each company was allowed two representatives one a high level executive the other a technical staffer hundreds of companies are scheduled for similar meetings in a months time reaction of u s business to the presidents program is very mixed responses from chemical industry range from strong criticism to wary acceptance with uniformly strong emphasis on government budget control the problems for companies in complying with details not called gulations because the program is voluntary are already becoming evident rarely is a government agency thrust into a regulatory role so quickly although the last wageprice control experience is instructive it does not provide answers to many new qu stions cma  there is some indication just for one example of dealing differ ently with various industries the chemical industry has had exaggerated price movement in the period  followed by a more normal price movement in the last three years chemicals and allied products wholesale price index  increase from previous year percent               it would appear that the choice of the period of  for average price increase determination under the presidents program leaves little leeway for price improvement on an industrywide basis the only part of the presidents program requiringlegislation is the tax rebate plan for those getting compensation increases less than the seven percent guideline there are already signals from capitol hill that this concept will be controversial when the president presents it to the new congress industrywide responses will be dealt with by mca as the pro gram develops the association staff will monitor developments in the wageprice program and an appropriate task group will task group will make recommendations on wageprice issues and lead any necessary communications efforts costle heads presidents regulatory council president carter has named douglas m costle administrator of the environmental protection agency to chair the newly created anti inflation regulatory council the council will be comprised of representatives of the departments of agriculture commerce energy health education and welfare housing and urban development interior justice labor treasury and transportation the role of the council is to coordinate federal rulemaking to ensure more efficient and costeffective regulations a staff of  people will be drawn from the federal agencies involved the councils first assignment is the development of a unified calendar of major federal regulations to be published in the federal register by february   the regulatory council will complement activities already re quired by executive order  on regulatory reform these would include the work of the regulatory analysis review group rarg which is chaired by the council of economic advisors with staff support from the council on wage and price stability however the rarg has authority to review only  major regulations per year with a maximum of four regulations per federal agency cma   the initial proposals for the regulatory council would probably have increased the influence of the council of economic advisors and the council on wage and price stability to put a cap on costs of regulations however strong pressure from congress environ mental groups and labor caused the president to abandon the economic advisors  dominated regulatory council and adopt the current structure which is similar to the one proposed by agency chiefs as an alternative under the present organizational concept the office of management and budget omb and the council on wage and price stability cowps may participate but only as observers mr costles appointment is expected to increase epas visability and clout and his own stature within the administration however the job which runs through january   is likely to divert signifi cant amounts of time away from his duties as epa administrator attention to chemical incidents continues j a wide range of governmental and legal actions confront our industry because chemicals may be dangerous when misused overused or mishandled and because incidents resulting from such abuses greatly concern the public media attention and public concern in fact are intense and pgrowing and show no signs of abating this is in spite of the fact that the chemical industry as a whole has had an excellent record in handling hazardous chemicals on a daily basis without harm to the public or the environment i i governmental and congressional attention is just as intense and official bodies have proposed many solutions to problems arising from chemical incidents they have done so however in a piecemeal and uncoordinated manner in their various forms these solutions call for the transfer of resources to provide the following  penalties for spills  restitution for individuals personally or economically harmed  remedies or neutralization of the effects of chemical mishaps and  restoration of damaged sites and conditions the adjournment of the th congress on october  has not halted attempts by the legislative and executive branches to devise remedies for incidents related to overuse misuse or improper dis posal of chemicals  the house commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations held one day of hearings on october  the subjects were contamina tion problems occuring in hard man county tennessee where velsicol chemical corporation disposed of chemical wastes at a companyowned acre site and the continuing problem of love canal in niagara new york a second hearing is tentatively scheduled for middecember cma   to focus on existing laws and their applicability to hazardous waste disposal with particular emphasis on inactive or abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites  just prior to adjournment representative john j lafalce dniagrany introduced two bills which address these difficult public policy questions the first would provide relief to all per sons injured as a result of toxic pollutants in the environment the second would establish a doubleduty fund for maintenance of new and existing dump sites and maintenance and reclamation of abandoned sites both bills as well as other liability and compensation pro posals considered but not approved by the th congress will likely be reintroduced in the th congress  the epa has indicated that it is giving top priority to an effort to determine an appropriate system for providing remedial action for inactive or abandoned waste disposal sites which pose a threat to the environment it appears that the fund concept de veloped in the th congress  first for oil and then chemical spills  will reappear in new legislative initiatives where restitu tion is involved  all indications suggest that the new congress will return to formation of public policy regarding liability for chemical incidents early in  staff preparation is already underway both the house and the senate have pledged early action on rcra and it is anticipated that amendments will be enacted in  it is possible that liability and compensation provisions will be included in amendments to rcra and that they may either include or set precedents for other types of pollution problems resulting from spills or unintentional discharge  the senate environment and public works committee staff is currently examining new superfund programs for introduction in   the house commerce committee and epa are focusing on the problems associated with disposal of hazardous wastes important tax legislation enacted three pieces of tax legislation were enacted in the closing days of the th congress which are of interest to the chemical industry revenue act of  most important of these is the revenue act of s passed by congress on october  and signed by the president on november  following are major provisions of this measure affecting corporations  corporate income tax rate  the maximum corporate income tax rate will be reduced from o to  effective  cma    investment tax credit  the  investment tax credit and the  used property limitation have been made permanent the amount of tax liability that may be offset by the credit will increase from  to  phased in  percentage points per year starting in  the credit has been extended to expenditures for the rehabilitation of structures which have been in use for at least  years effective october   the full investment credit will be available for pollution control facilities even where year amortization has been elected effective december   however if the facility is financed with taxexempt industrial development bonds the credit will be allowed for onlyhalf the investment the liberalization of the investment credit and the re duction in corporate income tax rate will reduce business sector taxes by an estimated  billion in   capital gains  effective october   for individuals  instead of  of net capital gains may be deducted from gross income the alternative capital gains rate of  on the first  of gains is repealed for taxable years beginning after december   for corporations the alternative capital gains tax will be reduced from  to  for sales occurring after december    product liability losses  net operating losses attributable to product liability losses may be carried back  years companies will be permitted to set aside reasonable amounts of aftertax income as a reserve against future liability losses without trigger ing a penalty tax  business entertainment  deductions will be denied after december   for certain entertainment facilities such as yachts and hunting lodges deductions will continue for country club dues for tickets to sporting events and for business meal expenses foreign earned income act of  for taxable years beginning after december l  this act eliminated the flat exclusion for americans working abroad and replaces it with a combination of costofliving excess housing costs education and travel de ductions taxpayers living in certain hardship locations would be allowed a special  deduction in order to fully compensate them and to encourage u s citizens to accept employment in those areas fringe benefits pl   this act passed in september and signed by the president in early october prohibits irs from issuing final regulations relating to the taxation of mployee fringe benefits before  it also prohibits the treasury department or irs from issuing rulings or final regulations concerning the deductibility of certain commuting or transportation expenses incurred before  cma  oil pricing continues since its enactment in  the emergency petroleum allocation act epaa as amended by the energy policy and conservation act of  epca has provided the basic authority for executive branch regulation of the pricing and allocation of crude oil residual fuel oil and each refined petroleum product  current authority under these laws the president is required to regulate the price of oil until may   his authority to alter the present oil pricing regulatory scheme prior to that date is subject to congressional review and thus a possible veto by either house of congress the president does have the authority however to allow the average domestic price of oil to rise ten percent annually under a priceadjustment mechanism since the average domestic oil price has been kept well below the legislated ceiling price there is a significant amount of accumulated percentage in crease allowable between now and may should the president decide to employ this authority  presidential authority from may   through september   on may   the congressional mandate to control the price of oil expires after that date the president has discretionary authority to promulgate and amend pricing regulations or issue other directives through september  however it is a matter of dis pute whether this discretionary authority remains subject to con gressional review and veto limitations  petroleum industry position the petroleum industry supports decontrolled domestic oil prices and would like to see the presidents discretionary authority after may   interpreted so as to provide flexibility to abolish controls and without the congressional review and limitations  chemical industry position mca has testified on the pricing issue on numerous occasions we support any action which will permit petroleum prices to rise to world levels through decontrol or phasedremoval of price controls this would permit primary energy prices to reflect replacement costs and provide the maximum incentive to develop new resources and expand the supply base  u s price relative to major

statehouses throughout the country although democrats continue to maintain political dominance control for the th congress republicans achieved a net gain of  seats in the u s house of representatives and  seats in the senate the senate gain is dependent on confirmation of john warners victory in virginia in the house republicans could gain another seat or two depending on the outcome of still undecided contests the new membership of the house will be comprised of  democrats and  republicans the new senate will include  democrats and  republicans at the state level republicans won  governorships including such important states as texas pennsylvania minnesota wisconsin and nebraska previously held by democrats this represents a net gain of  bringing the governorships now held by republicans up from  to a total of  the gop also gained majorities or ties in  state legislatures and achieved a net gain of approxi mately  state legislative seats of greater significance than mere numerical changes are trends toward the right republican party resurgence at the grass roots pvel and changes in the leadership of congressional committees lich impact on the chemical industry cma  l   house and senate leadership on the democratic side of the house speaker oneill ma majority leader wright tx and caucus chairman foley wa were returned to congress november  and are expected to be reelected to their house leadership positions december  john brademas in is expected to be reappointed party whip regarding house republicans there is speculation affecting minority leader john rhodes az andor john anderson il chairman of the republican conference the number  g  p position rhodes has been criticized by conservative house republicans for a lack of aggressive leadership and his willingness to compromise with the opposition it appears that only republican whip robert michel il could be a real threat to rhodes but the two are close friends and michel is thought unlikely to mount a challenge michel is next in line to succeed retired elford cederberg mi as ranking minority member on the house appropriations committee but republicans have traditionally foreclosed a member from holding leadership and ranking committee posts simultaneously however next behind michel in seniority on the appropriations committee is silvio conte ma re garded as a big spender and too liberal by many republicans con sequently there is talk that rhodes could placate the conservatives and finesse a challenge to his minority leadership position by backing a waiver allowing michel to be both whip and top republican on appropriations one of the most powerful committees in the house an early test of the suggested new conservatism of the house may ensue if guy vander jagt mi challenges liberal john anderson il for leadership of the caucus known as the republican conference the republican policy committee chair is also open due to the retirement of del clawson ca bill frenzel mn is expected to win this post as head of the republican research committee which could set up a contest between moderate lawrence coughlin pa and conservative trent lott ms in the senate democrats are expected to elect warren magnuson wa to succeed retired james eastland ms as president protem they will undoubtedly reelect robert byrd wv as majority leader and alan cranston ca as majority whip senate republicans are expected to reelect howard baker tn as minority leader and ted stevens ak as minority whip  committee changes u s house of representatives house committees have undergone dramatic changes toward new and younger leadership in recent years and when the th congress convenes in january only two chairmen will have held their posts for more than six years education and labors carl perkins dky and commerces harley staggers dwv because of retirements defeats convictions indictments and reprimands at least five and possibly seven of the  standing committees will have new chairmen and the subcommittees will be playing a game ofinusical chairmen cma  richard bolling dmo will become chairman of the important rules committee he is even more liberal and is expected to work more closely with the leadership than the retiring chairman james delaney dny claude pepper dfl becomes the ranking democrat on the committee there will be some changes on the powerful appropriations committee as jamie whitten dms succeeds year veteran george mahon dtx as chairman and elford cederberg rmi steps down as ranking republican also on the appropriations com mittee dan flood dpa could be forced to give up his chairman ship of the laborhew subcommittee which has jurisdiction over  osha appropriations because of his recent indictment the committee on interstate and foreign commerce which has jurisdiction over environmental matters toxic substances solid waste disposal and various federal health and cancer programs is in a state of disarray three of its most important subcommittee chairmanships will need to be filled health paul rogers dfl retired oversight and investigations john moss dca retired and transportation fred rooney dpa defeated i i j t j i leading contenders for the health subcommittee chair are david satterfield dva and richardson preyer dnc satterfield is perceived by a number of committee members as too conservative to head this key subcommittee with jurisdiction over clean air drug reform legislation saccharin and other important health and cancerrelated issues preyer a relative moderate and former federal judge respected by committee colleagues and the house leadership would be the next choice but he has family connections and investments in the pharmaceutical industry which could cause an apparent conflict in the subcommittees work on drug regulation and fda legis lation bob eckhardt dtx is favored in the contest for the chair of the publicityprone oversight and investigations subcommittee if he succeeds eckhardt will have to give up his chairmanship of the consumer protection subcommittee which will open up this sub committees allimportant jurisdiction over the toxic substances control act the situation is also uncertain for the transportation subcommittee which has jurisdiction over rcra hazardous materials derailments and other environmental issues somewhere down the line such leading liberal democrats as james scheuer dny are going to get their chance to chair one of these subcommittees the ways and means committee responsible for federal tax laws will lose  democratic members including ranking democrat james burke ma omar burleson tx joe waggoner la and otis pike of special significance is the retirement of joe waggoner longtime friend of business leader of southern conservatives in the house and chairman of the miscellaneous revenue measures subcommittee leading contenders for his subcommittee chairmanship are all  republicans on the committee are returning they should pick up an additional seat on the committee due to the additional republicans elected to the house which changes the ratio of democratstorepublicans on committees cma  i t  on the interior committee morris udall daz returns as chairman ranking republican joe skubitz ks retired and don clausen ca is expected to become top republican phil ruppes rmi retirement eliminates one proponent of the pbb indemnifica tion legislation but others will undoubtedly come forward to espouse this cause on the public works committee harold johnson ca returns as chairman and william harsha oh as ranking republican a change could occur in the chairmanship of the government operations subcommittee on manpower this is the subcommittee which held extensive hearings on chemical hazards in the workplace and has played a key role in pressuring osha into adopting such recent regulations as the generic carcinogen standard chemical substances identification and access to employees medical records cardiss collins dil is the present chairwoman but if charles diggs dmi is forced to relintjuish his african affairs subcommittee chairmanship because of his recent conviction for payroll irregular ities ms collins may take over diggs chair this would open her manpower subcommittee chairmanship to either glenn english dok or elliot levitas dga on the commerce committee howard cannon dnv returns as chairman but james pearsons rks retirement and robert griffens rmi defeat opens the ranking republican post for ted stevens rak however if reelected minority whip stevens would be precluded from holding this committee post which would then go to bob packwood chairman jennings randolph dwv and ranking republican robert stafford rvt return to the important environment and public works committee henry jackson dwa returns as chairman of the energy committee but the retirement of james abourezk dsd and defeats of floyd haskell dco and wendell anderson dmn open three democratic seats on the committee retirement of clifford hansen rwy opens up the ranking republican position for mark hatfield ror on the finance committee chairman russell long dla returns but defeats of floyd haskell dco and william hathaway dme vacate two subcommittee chairmanships which will probably be filled by the two democrats appointed to their seats ranking minority member carl curtis rne retirement opens the way for robert dole rks to fill that slot but to do so dole must give up his ranking minority position on the agriculture committee there may also be some changes on the human resources committee which has jurisdiction over such major legislation as labor law reform workers compensation erisa and osha if ranking minority member jacob javits rny takes the ranking republican post on the foreign relations committee as expected he will lose his cma  f  ranking position and some staff on the human resources committee chairman harrison williams dnj may give up his labor subcom mittee chairmanship for another subcommittee of a different committee and then merge his labor subcommittee into the full human resources committee  timetable for selection of committee members and chairmen during the first week in december house members will elect their leadership speaker majority leader and majority whip by democrats and minority leader and minority whip by republi cans recommendations

corporations disc cma has learned that the treasury department is considering a modification of the domestic international sales corporation disc provisions of the internal revenue code this consideration has arisen because of allegations by european common market members that the disc provision violates the gatt subsidies code under present law the disc provisions permit a corporation to defer current us income taxation on up to onehalf of its export profits so long as those profits are devoted to export related activities in  the latest year for which official treasury department figures are available the chemical and allied products industries deferred  million in taxes from disc sales or  percent of total gross receipts at issue however is not only the value of the current tax incentive for disc related activities but the tax treatment of previously deferred disc income since the disc provisions were enacted in  total tax deferrals could be substantial for many cma member companies at the september meeting cmas board of directors expressed its concern over developments related to disc and directed the tax policy committee to review this problem and to develop an appropriate cma response and strategy on october   the foreign tax task group met on disc and a representative will present a status report to the board at its november meeting in the interim cma president robert a roland has written directly to treasury secretary donald t regan to stress the prime importance of disc to the chemical industry and cmas desire to be consulted in the development of this legislation action required none for information only cma cma   exhibit c report on disc report of the tax policy committee on disc cma enthusiastically applauds the decision of the reagan administration to continue its support of the provisions of the internal revenue code which pertain to domestic international sales corporations disc for some time the treasury department and the office of the special trade representative had considered proposals to modify the disc provisions this review stemmed from allegations of our major european trading partners that those provisions violate the gatt subsidies code it is understood that the gatt council may make a final decision in the near future on whether disc violates gatt it is possible that such a decision could be delayed for an  month period cma is most encouraged that the administration will vigorously defend the disc provisions however if it is ultimately decided that disc violates gatt the united states will be faced with repealing or replacing oisc or retaining disc and allowing gatt members to impose countervailing duties and to take trade reprisals this would prob ably result in gatt becoming a weakened international organization the disc issue is very important to the economics of the us chemical industry export sales comprise a significant portion of total industry sales and export profits are likewise significant the elimination of the disc provisions would substantially affect the ability of the us chemical industry to compete in international markets moreover if disc were eliminated and accumulated earnings were made subject to tax chemical companies would see a substantial plunge in available capital and earnings reported to shareholders in that year because of payment of the tax or an increase in tax reserves it is possible that disc could be replaced by a different export incentive such as a foreign international sales company regardless of what is proposed ongoing industry effort will be required to ensure that any disc replacement is at least as beneficial as disc the key questions that must be considered in this regard are the treatment of existing tax deferrals and intercompany pricing rules in view of these considerations the tax policy committee recommends that cma take the following positions with respect to disc cma supports disc as the minimum response of the us government to an effective export policy cma and cma  member companies should urge secretary regan ambassador rock and other representatives of the government not to concede that oisc might violate gatt european countries should be made to understand that the united states believes that disc is not as strong an export incentive as the effect of the tax systems of those countries and that the united states is committed to and will provide an incentive no less strong than disc cma should however direct its tax policy committee to study develop and pursue alternative export incentives so that cma could respond imnediately with an acceptable alternative to any action of gatt the treasury or the congress that might lead to a likely repeal of disc in its activities the tax policy conmlttee believes it should pursue three fundamental principles first any alternative export incentive shall be at least as beneficial to exports on an overall basis as the present disc provisions second any alternative export incentive must contain clear and equitable principles for the pricing of exports along the lines of section  of the disc rules third there should be no tax imposed as part of any changeover to an alternative entity on present accumulated disc earnings more than  billion in current us corporate income taxes may have been deferred by american industry through the operation of the disc provisions of this amount the chemical industry has deferred more than  billion in taxes that would be imnedlately charged against earnings reported to shareholders under generally accepted principles of accounting if the disc provisions are repealed the tax policy comnittee will report to the board of directors should a change in circumstances occur that necessitates reconsideration of the policy described herein cma cma  i exhibit d survey of cma companies the effect of the reagan tax cuts on research  development the that cma reagans a survey would be cma board

report the creation of this department was announced at the january  board meeting consequently it has been in existance for only  months it is staffed by one professional and a secretary rationale for creating department the chemical industry has been under critical pressure for many years by environmentalists the media and government both legislative and regulatory as the industry is widely spread across the country with some welldefined areas of heavy concentration these pressures also have been widely spread eventually the pressures extended to and were applied by national environmental groups national media and the federal government cma had no formal mechanism at state and local levels to counter the efforts directed against the industry one was needed  a broadly based one to strengthen cmas advocacy effectiveness on the national scene the need became even more evident with the election of president reagan and his commitment to defederalization this turning to the states by the federal government in no way lessened the absolute necessity for strength in washington it reaffirmed the need for now the industry was to face fighting on  fronts the states with much of which would take place lighting the fuse on issues to explode statebystate right up to congress in the early s some state and local groups representing the chemical industry in their respective areas were formed largely on their initiative cma then mca had an onagain offagain love affair with these autonomous organizations some flourished some died others were quite passive in the s and early s when support was vital cma couldnt decid what to do eventually those that survived went their own way the relationship with cma was not good that was how matters stood in january  see attached brochure today testerday tomorrow a brief look at state organizations cma  departmental objective build a strong broadly based chemical industry state and local structure to support cma at the point of the pyramid in washington by developing a close cooperative association with existing associations councils and chemical industry committees helping to found additional similar groups where warranted working in like manner with the corporate headquarters of cma members and through them with their plants in local areas studying the chemical industry seeking to find companies eligible for cma membership and recruit them through the membership committee and the board while working closely with the cma offices of secretary and treasurer serving cma through eyes and ears attuned to problems upon which the association should act positively acting as the catalyst to bring association resources to bear on problems and assure that needed seminars symposia policy positions and programs are fielded where needed principally with state organizations action to date top priority has been given to strengthening existing state groups and our ties with them this priority also included helping in firming the establishment of four just coming on stream when the department was created the four brought to  the number of groups one southern california has since merged with the california chemical industry council to constitute a blanket organization for the state it will however continue as a satellite group as most of the plant operations are in the south and there is need for it to continue to meet on concerns peculiar to its area see inside back cover of brochure for list of groups the newest groups are in new york pennsylvania connecticut and tennessee with member company personnel we are working on building relationships with the chemical groups instituted under the wings of the associated industries of kentucky and the virginia manufacturers association we also are actively exploring the possibilites of assisting in the creation of units in north carolina arkansas and iowa cma  to help us focus on critical areas we conducted two studies both of which are appended the first was divided into two parts the initial section covered the top  states as to value of shipments all existing state groups fell into this category in conjunction with the state activities division of the government relations department we then selected those remaining states most likely to give the industry problems and ranked them also as to value of shipments this came to  and none has a state chemical group other categories in the study and ranked were value added number of chemical employees in production the percent of this to all manufacturing employees in the state the percent of chemical employees to total state population the number of cma companies in the state and the number of their plants and the number of cma companies in the state with  million or more in annual sales of the three states currently under study for new groups north carolina and iowa fall into the top  kentucky and virginia with whom we are working as noted earlier alsp are in this grouping thus we either have existing or under study organizations in  of the  those without are targets and include indiana south carolina florida georgia massachus tts maryland and wisconsin arkansas falls into the set of  ranking third in value of shipments these studies have been distributed to cma staff for needs as they see fit and either have or will be given to all state groups the second study also attached shows us the participation by cma member companies in existing state groups according to their membership rosters supplied us by october   as these groups accept members the year around it is possible some cma member companies have joined or applied or are consider ing joining since receipt of rosters the brunt of support is borne by  to  percent of our members there are a number with spotty memberships some with none these are targets of opportunity for broadening the industrys outreach effort t f to consolidate our efforts to date and to further increase mutually beneficial working relationships we scheduled the first annual meeting of state groups on november  the day following the semiannual meeting  i as of this writing all but one of the state groups will participate and there is reason to believe attendance will be  percent kentucky virginia and iowa representatives also will attend j cma  an inducement each group was provided one freebee to the semiannual and state meetings any additional attendees bore the full charge indicated attendance again as of this writing is approximately  or more as the program included the vice presidents for technical legal government relations and communications spelling out the services available to state groups an equal portion of the program featured actions by state groups one section was devoted to what they felt they need from us and how needs can be satisfied since the founding of the department i have visited on their home grounds every existing group at least once i have had two or more visits with a number speaking at executive committee semiannual and annual meetings the message what we are trying to do and the how and why of it the reception without exception has been gratifying they feel wanted needed and appreciate the outstretched hand any reluctance has largely been overcome cooperation by all segments of cma staff has been excellent when called upon response has been thorough and prompt also there has been no reluctance to call upon member services for assistance in reaching state groups when specific needs exist further many valuable suggestions have come from various departments action forecast all attending will be asked to critique the first annual meeting so that the second can be better more fruitful new state groups will be formed as needed and if possible as quickly as conditions permit the promotion of joint meetings by state groups will be furthered the texas chemical council already has invited the california chemical council to meet jointly at its annual meeting if this is successfultcc plans to continue such efforts with others the possibility of two to three regional meetings of state groups under cma sponsorship will be studied and begun if feasible efforts will continue to help state groups build membership hopefully there will be time to institute a state group newsletter services and visits as initiated will

advisory committee spac developed guidelines for che conduct of special programs reviewed all of the ongoing special programs and made recommendations on all proposed new programs significant recommendations resulting from spacs reviews are summarized below proposed nev programs arsenic spac recommended approval of a new program on arsenic the primary objective of the program is the education of people within regulatory agencies through a jointly sponsored arsenic symposium with the national bureau of standards this symposium november   will provide a means for industry and government agencies to come to an understanding of costeffective regulation of arsenic as a hazardous material through knowledge of production and use patterns toxicologic properties and the presence of arsenic in the environment ethylene oxide the ethylene oxide industry council was formed to  develop information regarding responsible industry programs to control exposure to ethylene oxide  to develop relevant scientific technological and economic data and ill to present such information and data to u s governmental bodies considering regulatory controls pertaining to ethylene oxide so as to assure that such standards regulations or policies are reasonable scientifically sound and economically and socially effective spac recommended approval of the formation of this council polychlorinated biphenyls under the chemical regulations advisory committee crag companies affected by che courts decision on polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs initiated two surveys to provide epa with information for promulgating a final regulation the estimated cost of these surveys and other consultant fees was  crac budgeted the original phase and then asked chat the program be moved to the special programs division spac approved che first phase of a pcb special program which will include conducting two surveys analyzing che data from che surveys and participating in formal rulemaking crac contributed  toward this effort spac will review the program at che end of phase i and will make a recommendation on whether phase ii should be continued under special programs new source performance standard on nonmetalllc minerals iie to lack of funding the environmental management committee transferred a request for a new program on nonmetalllc minerals to che special programs division initially the burden of these regulations would have cma  bn on the nonmetallic mineral industry alone but the precedent would be set for the regulatory agency to take such actlona on ocher sectors of the chemical industry spac recommended approval of this program with the special programs division providing all administration and the environmental division providing all technical support subsequent to this recommendation the spa under the new administration decided not to pursue the proposed regulation and therefore the spac recommendation was not brought to the executive committee specific recommendations to panels acrylonitrile in  cma signed a  contract to investigate the possible toxic effects and the pharmacodynamics of ingested and inhaled acrylonitrile in laboratory animals in  the contract was amended and the contract amount raised to  the contractor submitted the report on the last phase of this study on december   at the same time the contractor submitted a final invoice containing a costoverrun of  cma has initiated balloting of panel members to determine if they approve payment of this cost overrun several ballots remain outstanding upon spacs recommendation the cma legal department confirmed that cma is not reponslble under the terms of the contract for the overrun although several companies have still not responded with their ballots staff and cma counsel are working closely with the contractor and the panel to resolve the cost overrun chlorobenzenes when epa issued a tsca section a draft test rules package on chlorobenzenes two cma groups became involved the crac testing task group identified broed policy and legal issues and spoke with epa regarding the precedentsetting implications the program panel which has always been researchoriented established a toxicology regulatory task group to address specific toxicological issues concerning the six chlorobenzenes recommended for immediate testing in addition socma formed the chlorobenzenes producers association to assume an advocacy position all of these groups worked together to form a unified industry position on the test rules package spac recommended that these groups continue with the work they have begun until the federal register notice comes out spac further recommended that as most of the companies participating in cma research and socma advocacy programs are the same a consideration be given to bringing both the chlorobenzenes research and advocacy programs under one umbrella organization at an appropriate time ethylene dibromlde audits of the mci and niosh studies were completed and an independent auditor found that both of these studies were acceptable spac therefore on august   supported the panels decision to disband although they suggested a new panel be formed to continue for advocacy following this decision osha received a petition from the teamsters union to lower the exposure limit on edb from  ppb to  ppb spac reviewed plans for a reconstituted panel on october    cma  fluorocarbons sfac approved a limited advocacy role for the fluorocarbons program panel so chat the panel could make statements on science the first was in response to the november  nas report stratospheric ozone depletion by halocarbons chemistry and transport spac recommended that the panel continue its limited advocacy charter and appointed two members to explore appropriate means of coordinating the alliance the cma fluorocarbons panel and the cma section  testing task force of the chemical regulations advisory committee ketones spac endorsed the panels plans to establish an early dialogue with epa regarding the anticipated tsca section a rule however spac recommended that the panels charter be amended to include epidemiologic studies and possible evaluation of the environmental effects of ketone phthalate esters in early  the phthalate esters panel planned a material handling survey of the manufacturers distributors and users of phthalates however since cma is a trade association representing manufacturers spac recommended that all action be cabled until the society of the plastics industry could be contacted in the meantime a study by the national cancer institute became available which for the first time raised health affects concerns for phthalate esters in addition based upon ncis findings epa requested additional information on pmns for phthalate esters the panel was concerned that epa had taken regulatory action on preliminary information and that epa might come up with an unreasonable tsca section a rule spac recommended that the panel add advocacy to its charter and that they establish a dialogue with epa on developing a voluntary test standard this was a valuable recommendation as can be seen by the subsequent accomplishments of this panel section  of the attachment titanium dioxide spac recommended that in the absence of any significant findings in the longterm inhalation study in progress at dupont the pmnel consider disbanding vinyl chloride the vinyl chloride panel hired an independent consultant to review the work performed by industrial biotest ibt under contract to cma this consultant recommended that cma examine animal tissues still available from the study the panel did not act upon this recommendation however they did ask ibt for a refund of the  they had already paid under che contract the panel was waiting for financial resolution with ibt before submitting a final report to government agencies spac recommended that the panel not wait for resolution before submitting a final and report chat they act up a th consultants recommendation to do additional histopathology the panel followed this rec mmendatlon  cma  zinc dialkyl dlthlophosphata spac heard a proposal for a new special program on zddp although this new panel urns interested in studying the reproductive role of zddp in rats and rabbits spac recommended that they consider undertaking an epidemiological study spac approved the panels draft charter with a strong recommendation that it be expanded to include advocacy the panel followed this recommendation spacs recommendations to the executive committee sfacs review of ongoing special programs as well as proposals for new programs concentrated on scientific and policy issues the adequacy of professional and financial support from participating companies the availability of cma resources and the inclusion of advocacy in the panels charter the first year of reviews under the new special programs guidelines provided the members of spac with valuable insight into the workings of program panels in the future spac will concentrate on the significant activities of the panels since their last meeting with spac spac will also make sure chat recommendations made during previous reviews were acted upon staff will keep spac informed of new actions as they occur rather than waiting for a scheduled meeting further background on the functioning of the special programs division its major accomplishments during the past year and a summary of each program is attached to this report spac has now completed its first year as authorized by the executive committee spac is performing a valuable oversight function for cma special programs and i therefore recommend reauthorization of this committee for a second year cma  cma   attachment  biomedical and environmental special programs an overview mission th mission of the cma biomedical and environmental special programs division special programs is to provide manufacturers processors and or users of a chemical or chemicals with the opportunity to support collec tively research andor advocacy on specific chemicals when referring to special programs advocacy involves external communication not designed solely for information exchange that relates to existing or developing regulations legislation or litigation cma serves participating companies by providing proper and effective administration of programs scientific information developed through research programs should pro mote the health and safety of the general public and of workers involved in manufacturing processing and using these chemicals all significant findings and reports of ckaadminlstared research programs are available to the public in a timely manner  division summary cma approved the first special project in  the initial special projects were exclusively research oriented the intent at that time was for cma to collect and disburse the necessary funds contract for the research to be done and provide meeting facilities and surveillance over the conduct of the meetings the time requirements on cma staff were expected to be minimal since the participating companies would provide all technical expertise and management skills necessary to conduct the pro grams the administration of these programs was assigned to cma secretar ies of several standing committees the number of special programs administered by cma increased at a mod erate rate from  to  by the end of  cma was administering to seventeen special programs since  requests for cma to undertake new special programs have increased considerably this increase is due mainly to increased activities related to the toxic substances control act clean air act and clean water act the special programs division presently coordinates research andor advocacy for twentythree special programs cma took its first steps toward advocacy in  when the benzene pro gram panel was formed in response to a workerexposure standard proposed by osha industry believed that the scientific studies on which this standard was based were flawed the benzene panels charter was to develop a sound technical base that could be used by industry to challenge the proposed regulations the benzene panels charter was expanded in november  to cma   allow eh panal co represent the interests of tha members of cma

spac are  co review requests for individual product advocacy by special pro gram panels and determine that appropriate conditions for these advocacy positions are met  to review each ongoing special program at least once a year to provide guidance based on spac members expertise and  to make certain that advocacy actions of each special program are in harmony with cma standing commlttae positions appendix a lists current members of spac during  spac completed review of all ongoing special programs in addition in  and  spac approved cma undertaking new special programs on arsenic ethylene oxide

participating in special programs  staff organization asp responsibilities the special programs division has a staff of thirteen including a director five program administrators a program coordinator five secretaries and one word processor one program administrator and one secretary devote their time exclusively to the fluorocarbon program the other four program administrators and four secretaries are responsible for the remaining twentytwo programs figure  outlines the organization f special programs with respect to both the staff and the specific programs program administrators prepare for and attend panel and task group meetings prepare records of meetings and write and administer all con tracts in their respective areas in addition program administrators o maintain awareness of pertinent regulations relating to panels activities o communicate with government agencies on scientific and regulatory matters o coordinate information flow to and from the agencies the com panies other trade associations and academic communities o coordinate the development of advocacy and regulatory position  cma  i papers with appropriate cma staff standing committees aad outsida consultants and o providemonitoring and auditing services for ongoing research projects the special programs division keeps the office of general counsel informed of the status of ongoing panel activities budget to date cma program panels have spent  in research and advocacy programs on  families of chemicals see table  overhead reimbursement budget cma charges participating companies the full costs including overhead for administration of special programs the program account is charged  per day for professional staff this charge includes both the direct and allocated costs of full time professional and clerical special programs staff and routine professional or support assistance from the technical legal government relations communica tions and administrative services departments other direct costs such as outoftown travel meeting room and program equipment rentals when meeting outside cma conference calls telex unusually large printing and mailings etc are charged as miscellaneous administrative expenses to the program other cma professional staff time if required to work on specific or nonrou tine aspects of the program is charged at the same rate as the pro gram administrator in addition to an overhead reimbursement of  per day the cma special programs division is credited monthly with z of received but not expended special program funds as interest interest received on nondlsbursed special program funds is used to defray administrative costs not recovered by the dally race in the case of the fluorocarbon program the unexpended funds balance is approximately  million this has resulted in a special agreement with the program panel to credit its funds with interest at z and charge a fixed fee of  per month from june  to may  this arrangement produces an effective billing rate of  per day instead of the normal  per day the fixed fee of  will be reviewed in march  for fiscal year  panel researchadvocacy budget cma requires written commitment for the full amount of a study budget from all participating companies before executing study eontrscts a separate account is established to receive and disburse funds for each program  cma  as a matter of cma fiscal policy participating companlas are invoiced for a minimum of  of the projected fiscal year commitments initial invoicing occurs immediately after partici pating company management approval of the program activities during the course of the program additional collections are made as necessary to maintain a reserve from which disbursements are made reserves are maintained as low as possible under sound financial management a new phase of a program begins whenever there is a change in compoeltlon of sponsoring companies at the completion of any phase of a program uncommitted funds are carried over to a sub sequent phase if a company voluntarily drops out of a program at the completion of all contracted work a refund is made if the prorated balance of uncommitted funds exceeds  for that company a company which voluntarily drops out of a program during an ongoing study is expected to provide its full financial commitment to the current study phase including any additions or extensions which were approved during the term of its participa tion a financial statement detailing all expenses and commitments is prepared monthly for each program a copy of the statement is provided to panel members at their meetings to keep them informed of the financial status of the panel goals for    o to continue working on establishing new coatacts within regulatory agencies o to establish batter communication with both us and nohds trade associations involved in activities related to special programs o to enhance the scientific credibility of cma by promoting the publication of cmaadmlnlstarad research in peer review journals o to achieve better recognition of cmas eapabllltres by initi ating the special programs news letter starting january o to establish semiannual meetings with representatives of other trade associations involved in administration of toxicologic and epidemiologic research  cma  longrange plan through much hard work ou che pare of cma staff and panel members cmaadminiseered research is developing a reputation for its objectivity and integrity however there is room for improvement special programs needs to increase the chemical industrys awareness that special programs has the expertise to o administer research and advocacy programs and o provide scientific services which until recently have not been available expected or requested to accomplish this special programs has identified steps which should be taken over the next few years these include o reducing the work load per program administrator to enable himher to undertake the challenge of new casksprograms o encouraging staff through educational benefits to expand existing and develop new expertise in science and business management o hiring new staff to complement existing staff in scientific disciplines not already adequately covered o hiring additional support staff capable of assuming a portion of a program administrators nonscientlflc administrative duties in order to permit the program administrator to devote more time to scientific and liaison functions o playing a larger role in penetrating the washington scene and interacting with regulatory agencies and professional societies by establishing good professional relationships with peers in the regulatory agencies the industry and governmentfunded research laboratories o utilizing the contacts and experience of individual program administrators more effectively within the special programs division and ocher divisions of cma o completely reevaluating the method of compensating cma for services provided o developing the flexibility to provide services panels expect and for which they are willing to pay and o publicizing special programs accomplistazents and capabilities in cma news chemeeology the newlyproposed special programs newsletter peer review journals publication of research results news releases on significant findings  cma  major accomplishments  chlorobenzenes panel toxicologists provided eechnlcal input to the chloro benzenes producers association cpa for their submission to epa in response to epas proposed tsca section a test rule on chlorobenzenes this group of panel toxicologists has continued to work closely with the cpa in the development of a voluntary industry testing program that wjuld be acceptable by epa in lieu of formal test rule following earlier dialogues between cmacpa and spa a decisiontree approach to tasting of commercial chlorobenzenes was adopted the outline for this proposal is now being reviewed by epa the testing program as now envisioned would be much more conservative in scope than that originally outlined by epa in their proposed test rule  ethylene oxide the eo council is organized in such a way that it is able to respond immediately to emergency situations a petition to osha to issue an emergency temporary standard of  ppm was submitted on august   within two weeks the council working on advice from its regulatory and scientific committees and outside counsel prepared a precise detailed response which they sub mitted during a meeting with osha on september  this meeting was also attended by the american hospital association and the veterans administrationboth of which were anxious to join with the council to present a united industry position on september  osha denied the petition fluorocarbons o the program has made substantial contributions to the scien tific understanding of what is happening la the stratosphere the calculated ozone depletion at steady state approximately  years from now has fluctuated between z and more chan z current calculations indicate z o the program has achieved a reputation for scientific objec tivity and integrity seldom attributed to industrysponsored effort o there has been cooperation with government agencies through out the world and with international agencies research con ducted by government agencies has been funded or cofunded and research with universities or private laboratories has been cofunded with government support o cma is the only member of the coordinating committee on the ozone layer of the united nations environment program not  cma   representing a aacioaal government or aa inceraatlonal agency o perhaps che greacest coatritauclon has been che influence on che government funded stratospheric research particularly in che us the productivity of government agency research has been improved substantially over che past five years at least in part this has been due to the methodology followed and advocated by the industrysponsored program and the oversight and review provided by the fluorocarbon program panel  phthalate esters o the phthalate esters program panel has developed a voluntary test program to address potential health and environmental effects of a class of compounds o the panel has worked with che test rules development branch trdb of che environmental protection agency and has gained their acceptance of the test program trdb is currently proceeding with agency review of the program and we expect official acceptance by midnovember o the panel is optimistic that epa will decide that the data do not warrant a f finding at this time o the fda task group has developed a voluntary cast program for deha which is aimed at determining che cause of the bioassay results this program will be presented to fda with the hope chat che fda will accept the program in lieu of an interim regulation or ban on deha o the fda task group has successfully altered che elme table within

associated with low level pcb analysis this report was well accepted by the agency and received good coverage in several trade publications o in order to insure the objectivity of the data generated by its current round robin cma secured the participation of several epa laboratories in addition to member company labs it is hoped that the data generated from this cooperative effort will demonstrate to epa the variability of analytical results which must be considered la writing and enforcing a regulatory cut off level for pcba summaries special program advisory committee the special program advisory committee spac was formed to provide the program panels with multidisciplinary expertise in areas of scientific research and governmental advocacy spac reviews each special program on an annual basis and once a year reports to the cma executive committee on the progress f each program controversies which exist either within a panel or between staff and panels which cannot be resolved at staff level are brought to spac for review and recommendation spac reviews all new and revised programs for consistency with association policy acrylonitrile an the arerylonltrlle program is concerned with the epidemiology toxicology and environmental aspects of processes involving acrylonitrile its copolymers and its end products the program was begun in  to develop additional data on the toxicology of an this was accomplished through animal exposure studies by inhalation and ingestion an epidemiology study was not conducted because of lack of specific exposure data for most of the period to be studied as well as difficulties associated wlch designating a suitable control group several participating companies conducted their own internal epidemiology studies three of which have been published in detail  cma  fda has been interested la foodcontact applications of an polymers specially beverage bocclas however cha panal did aoc assume an advocacy position on this issue the society of plastics industry conducted advocacy related to osha regulations on an but cma was not involved as a result of proposed regulations by epa in  the monomer and polymer producers decided to charter a new organization under socma to fulfill the necessary advocacy role this new group will also perform any future research on acrylonitrile the cma panel voted to disband upon completion of its current research allyl chloride concern over the carcinogenic hazard attributed to vinyl chloride prompted the formation of the ac program panel in jan uary  the panel has so far undertaken three research pro jects a teratology study a pharmacokinetic and metabolic study and a day inhalation probe study the need for additional research will be determined after the results of these studies are evaluated an arsenic program panel was established in the first quar ter of  the panels objectives are to  gather informa tion  conduct necessary research to compliment existing infor mation  educate regulators and  undertake regulatory advo cacy the panels first priority was to sponsor an arsenic symposlias and an indepth critical literature review on the health effects associated with arsenic the symposium scheduled for november  in gaithersburg md is being cosponsored with the national bureau of standards session topics include industrial sources and uses of arsenic biomedical and environmental per spectives and epidemiology the literature review is underway november  the penel may initiate needs identified in this review and regarding present and proposed arsenic and should be completed in research studies based on may undertake advocacy standards the benzene program panel was formed in november  the panel assessed the data used by niosh and osha in proposing work place standards for benzene developed its own recommendations and gathered additional data to substantiate establishment of a standard  cma  th panel continues co b concerned with expansion of the toxicological and epidemiological data bast development of industry guidelines for workplace standards and health and safety aspects of epas proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants nesbap the panel completed a benzene reproduction study which showed no compoundrelated adverse effects in male and female rats exposed to levels up to ox the present workplace standard cma and the american petroleum institute have initiated an extensive day inhalation study of benzene toxicity in rats and mice which will be used to set dose levels for a subsequent twoyear chronic benzene study an epidemiology study of approximately  workers in nine plants should be completed in  butylated hydroxytoluene bht the bht panel was formed in response to a proposed interim regulation issued by the fda in hay  the panels goal is to collect toxicological information on bht and to recommend research to fill any data gaps which might exist an agency proposal pending was published on december   but the final rule is still not out the panel expects fda to recommend that only a day subchronic study be undertaken the panel is waiting for us government action before caking further action on bht the french government recently began phasing out bht as a direct food additive and is at present reviewing the use of bht as an indirect additive the joint faowro expert committee on food additives recently extended the temporary average dally intake adi for bht pending receipt of additional testing data chlorobenzenes cb the chlorobenzenes program panel began its program in  with the conduct of a worldwide literature search on available health data regarding monochlorobenzene mcb orthodichl robenzene odcb and paradlchloro benzene pdcb since that time the panel has been concerned with expanding the toxico logical data base on these three compounds and has recently added a fourth trlchlorobenzane to a proposed test program in october  the panel initiated a series of teratology studies on mcb odcb and pdcb in rats and rabbits to clarify results obtained in the mcb study in rabbits a followup study was conducted in this species a draft final report on both mcb studies is expected by the end of the year the odcb research was completed and interim data are being assembled animals go on test in the pdcb teratology study in november   cma  the panel has worked closely vlch che chlorobenzenes producers association cpa in formulating comments on epas proposed rules for testing of chlorobenzenes under tsca section a the cpa has held a series of discussions with epa in an effort to develop a voluntary industrysponsored testing program in lieu of a formal test rule a proposal outline was developed and submitted to the agency if approved the cpa has asked the panel to provide funding and administration for the program epoxy resin er the special program on epoxy resins was approved in july  the panel was formed to evaluate the available health effects literature on epoxy resins and to sponsor necessary research initially the panel decided to concentrate on blsphenola eplchlorohydrinderlved epoxy resins  the panel is initiating an advocacy role by requesting that osha remove blsphenol a diglycidyl ether from oshas candidate carcinogen list ethylene dibromide bob concerned about possible government regulatory action the panel was formed in  on december   epa issued a notice of rebuttable presumption against registration rpar the agency concluded that presumptions for oncogenicity muta genicity and reproductive disorders had not been rebutted a subchronic inhalation study conducted by dow chemical toxicology research laboratory showed that repeated subchronle exposure of rats to  or  ppm of edb induced pathologic changes in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinate subsequent postexpoeure phase revealed a lack of progression of the lesions with almost complete reversion toward normal histologic appearance of the nasal turbinate two additional studies were conducted by the national cancer institute nci and the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh the panel conducted thirdparty auditing of both of these studies the independent auditor found chat both studies were of acceptable quality and their findings valid since edb wee shown to be carcinogenic in both studies there is no need for either continued research or an advocacy program the panel therefore decided to disband however the panel has been reactivated as a result of the national brother hood of teamsters petition to osha to lower the current worker exposure standard from  ppb to  ppb n cma   ethylene dichlorida gdc th ethylene dichlorida program panel was formed la febru ary  co evaluate cha adequacy of knowledge

research this decision was reversed when it was learned chat epa was considering proposing a tsca section a rule  ethylene oxide eo a study conducted at bushyrun labs showed ethylene oxide to be carcinogenic in rats industry was interested in gathering information on the safe handling of ethylene oxide which led to the formation of the ethylene oxide industry council on july   the council operates through an executive committee and four operating committees scientific regulatory finance and membership and communications the council is developing information regarding responsible industry programs to  control exposure to ethylene oxide  to develop relevant scientific technological and economic data and  to cooperate with other national and international organ izations having similar objectives the councilwill present this information and data to any united states federal state or municipal governmental body considering regulatory controls o ethylene oxide so as to assure that such standards regulations or policies are reasonable scientifically sound and economi cally and socially effective the council developed a response to the petition filed by the public citizen health research group and the american fed eration of state county and municipal employees to lower the exposure standard for ethylene oxide the petition asked that the eight hour twa be lowered from  ppm to  ppm and that a shortterm exposure level of  ppm be established representa tives of the council mat with ossa officials on september  to discuss industrys eoacern regarding the petition on september  osha denied the petition  fluorocarbons fc the fluorocarbon program was formally organized in the spring of  with essentially all of the free world producers of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs supporting the effort the panels initial purpose was to determine the fate of cfcs in the atmos phere and the effects they may produce on plants or animals there was no suspicion of their effect on the stratosphere with the publication of the ozone depletion theory in june  che program was expanded end accelerated to date over  has been spent oa this research there is no indica tion that the

prograa panel for scientific data  glycol ethers gg the glycol ethers prograa was foraed on june   and is concerned prlaarlly with the alkyl and dialkyl ethers of ethylene glycol and dlethylene glycol selected ethers of propylene glycol and their acetic acid esters the panel conducted a review and evaluation of the published and available unpublished literature on health and envlronaantal effects as a result of the literature review the panel has developed a multiphase testing prograa this prograa includes testing of ethylene glycol monooethyl ether em ethylene glycol monobutyl ether eb and ethylene glycol mbnoethyl ether ee in  phase i for teratology and possible reproductive effects phase ix will begin in  and includes teratology studies on ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate ee acetate and propylene glycol monooethyl ether pm phase ii also includes a subchronlc study of ee and a research study still under development which will allow a comparative assessment of glycol ethers with their acetates a phase ii testing prograa on other glycol ethers may be developed in  the glycol ethers program panel currently is considering developing exposure data and has begun a liaison prograa with npca and csma the panel is also considering what role if any they wish to play in an advocacy prograa with epa andor osha currant advocacy activities involve interactions with niqsh acgih and ecetoc in  five ketones aethyl ethyl ketone mek methyl isobutyl ketone mibk mesityl oxide mo isophorone and cyclohexanone were recommended for testing under section e of tsca by the interagency testing committee the ketones panel met for the first time on january   their first activity was to assemble all toxicology literature on eight ketones including the five on the itc list both published and unpublished from the files of participating companies studies were reviewed and principal areas of deficiencies in toxicology information identi fied since the industrial health foundation ihf already had a program on cyclohexanone the present scope of the ketones panel is limited to the four remaining ketones on the itc list a revised epa schedule resulted from a ruling in favor of the natural resources defense council which had sued epa for  noncompliance under saecloa  by aot having initiated rulemaking vichin cha one year deadline the suit resulted in dead lines of  for cyclohexanone and  for the remaining four ketones further rescheduling resulted in deadlines in aid for all five ketones the panel is currently undertaking an advocacy program on four of the ketones on the itc list mek mibk mo and lsophorone the program involves developing use and exposure information as well as a voluntary test program a way inhalation study on methyl isobutyl ketone mxk is currently underway and reproduction and teratology studies are under consideration the panel will follow closely complimentary testing on methyl ethyl ketone by cut and methyl isoamyl ketone by eastman kodak the panel has met once with epa on testing recommendations for ketones under section a and is developing a document for submission to the agency the document will present summaries of toxicity data on the four ketones and use and exposure information an overview of the research program will also be included the phosgene panel was formed in april  its purpose is to maximize safety in the production and use of phosgene to reduce the possibility of exposure incidents and to d vel p effective diagnostic procedures and therapeutic countermeasures the panel is studying means for monitoring concentrations of phosgene in air means of evaluating actual exposures to phosgene as a guide to medical treatment and means of preventing incidents of phosgene release toward this objective the panel has funded o two animal studies and published two papers in the archives of environmental health these studies suggested possible mechanisms of phosgene poisoning and candidate therapeutic o a worldwide literature search and o a third animal study directed toward exposure of candidate therapeutic agents expected to be effective based on the literature search or on results from the first two animal research projects in order to improve engineering and safety practices during the manufacturing or use of phosgene the panel is structuring and conducting four surveys to identify and update this informa tion dupont and dow have each conducted inhouse retrospective epidemiology studies on workers exposed to phosgene the panel does not currently find it feasible to sponsor a prospective study due to the absence of a controlled phosgeneonly exposure  cma   to improve worker safety che panel is writing with instru ment designers and manufacturers to develop instrumentation with maximum sensitivity for both industrial process and personal monitoring develop protective clothing and self contained breathing devices the panel is also exploring improved inplant safety practices and developing optimal postexposure diagnostic procedures and therapeutic countermeasures  phthalate eaters ps the cma phthalate esters program panel which was formed in  originally concentrated its efforts on studying the environmental effects of phthalates extensive literature surveys at that time indicated little or no concern over the health effaets of phthalates the interagency testing committee recommended only environmental testing on the phthalate ester class of compounds under che provisions of section  of the toxic substances control act tsca epa could develop test rules for environmental testing however the phthalate esters panel began development of a comprehensive voluntary environmental effects test program as a result of a  draft report from the nci to the national toxicology program which shows that dlethylhexyl phthalate dehp also widely known as dop causes hepatocellular carcinoma at high dose levels in laboratory rodents phthalate esters received increased attention from regulatory agencies with che disclosure of the new ntp findings che program panel expanded its efforts to include a comprehensive testing program to address che human health concerns the goal was to develop a comprehensive voluntary test program that would develop test data required under section  of tsca but without the imposition of mandatory test rules the first phase of the comprehensive environmental effects and human health effects testing program is ready to be imple mented the human health effects portion has been designed to examine a limited number of compounds on a risk assessment basis the studies which comprise this phase of the program will gener ate sound scientific data chat can be applicable to phthalate esters as a class rather than to specific chemicals allocation of costs was developed to include all the affected industries phthalate producers raw materials suppliers and phthalate users the environmental effects testing portion includes the  phthalate esters produced in large volume the program includes acute testing for all  phthalates in three species additional acuta and chronic cast data will be developed for those esters for which test data is not already available the phthalate esters panel has held several discussions with mr newburgrlnn of epas test rules development breach as a result of these discussions epa held a public meeting on september   to propose acceptance of the panels oluncary test program final  cma  acceptance awaits receipt of written comments from the public and soma further review within the agency in a response to a citizens petition filed under section  of tsca the epa office of pesticides and toxic substances con ducted a priority review assessment of dehp which could result in a f action being taken by the agency the cma phthalate esters panel is currently working with epa on this issue phthalate and adipate esters are also of interest t three bureaus within the fda the bureau of foods the bureau of biologies and the bureau of medical devices the bureau of biologies and the bureau of medical devices are primarily interested in dehp use in flexible plastics that come in contact with blood blood elements or intravenous solutions the bureau of foods regulates deha for use in plastics chat come la contact with foods and dehp for use in plastics that contact nonfatty foods in addition other adipates dic cgalkyl adipate and dlnalkyl adipate made from cg cg cq alcohols are sanctioned for use in foods but foods but the sanctions on these latter compounds were based upon saf ty of deha in june  a new task group fdatg was formed within the phthalate ester panel to interact with fda on issues relating to adipates and phthalates at that time the bureau of foods was preparing a strategy document for submission to the fda commis sioner which could have resulted in a restriction or ban of deha in food contact applications the phthalate esters fdatg met with representatives of the fda and successfully delay d the strategy document the fdatg is currently preparing a detailed review of deha toxicity data and developing a voluntary testing program which fda could accept in lieu of an interim regulation or ban on deha since the phthalate esters panel was originally organized and funded to address epas concerns the fdatg activi ties will be funded separately the panel faces the challenge of presenting an industry con census on a class of compounds individual participating com panies have diverse interests but all have a common go to minimize the regulatory action on these substances by responsi ble voluntary programs supported broadly  polychlorinated biphenyls pcba the recent decision in edf v epa no  set aside two parts of epas

the con servation foundation to develop a hazardous waste siting book let for use in local communities she also participated as a member on the coast guards chemical transportation advisory committee where an international superfund was discussed see environmental programs the major activities of the technical department outside of those detailed in the following sections  centered on preparation for the semiannual meeting and the report for the technical review committee the review will be on november chemtrec the next chemtrec workshop is scheduled for louisville on november  the director and selected advisors are working with texas aam to refine their presentation theyre working to reduce to a minimum the outside resources required this program will continue through the three remaining developmental workshops there are now  companies with  stations on the hard copy network approximately onethird of the total traffic goes through this system the chemtrec advisors met october  to discuss a number of matters including reporting by carriers and emergency response outside of the united states cma  i  a member survey indicates that for the month period ending june   cma members have improved energy efficiency by  compared with  engineering cma reviewed and commented on five standards of substan tial interest to the chemical industry they were proposed for adoption as american national standards by underwriters labora tories ul and manufacturers standardization society cmas major concern continues to be adequate safety at reasonable cost of those reviewed cma reaffirmed its negative vote on three ul proposals because of inadequate wire beading space which would result in excessive installation and maintenance costs the committee is planning a forum on the causes and effects of power outages and cures for them with a view towards formulating remedial action the committee is preparing and selecting a speaker for the program for the third process computer users forum to be held in may  this forum will build upon what was learned last time about distributed computer control it will also explore managerial considerations including use of management information systems and scientific computations and full utilization of installed systems chemical regulations crac has been meeting with epa in a series of discussions on cmas petition requesting exemptions from pmn requirements for lowvolume chemicals sitelimited intermediates and certain polymers the meetings have focused on issues raised by epa and data requirements that the agency believes it needs prior to proposed rulemaking examples include definition of a qualified expert criteria for polymer exemptions and justifi cation for a  pound cutoff for lowvolume exemptions among others crac intends to complete its discussions with epa by the end of  and looks for epa proposed rules during the first quarter of  cma staff prepared an economic analysis supporting our  pound cutoff for lowvolume pmn exemptions pmnassociated costs were shown to adversely impact the market ability of new chemicals which in turn reduces the innovative capability of the chemical industry crac representatves and cma staff met with don clay director of the office of toxic substances ots to discuss major regulatory issues under tsca mr clay has assigned cma   three of his staff to develop comprehensive epa programs for reporting pmns and contract management for ots activities pmn exemptions will be part of epas priority programs which gives us assurance that proposed pmn exemption rules will be ready soon staff updated the portion of cmas submission to the vice presidents task force on regulatory relief dealing with tscarelated issues the update detailed the progress epa has made in addressing the key issues highlighted in the original report crac held a twoday planning meeting on october  to discuss how the current objective and key strategies of each task group are helping to achieve the overall goals of cma and to promote effective regulations under tsca crac plans to hold an information meeting for cma members on december  dr john todhunter epa is the invited guest speaker he will speak on the agencys plans for implementing tsca testing comments are being prepared on epa test rules proposed june  and on oecd proposed test guidelines the task group is also working on a strategy for getting closure on section  test standards and related issues reporting plans are being made to develop a strategy for implement ing section  of tsca in a more integrated manner the task group looks forward to interacting with epa in this effort csin the major effort of the task group is planning a workshop for early  on the subject of data quality hazards communications special committee cma submitted a draft hazards communications proposal to osha on july   the osha work group has reviewed cmas proposal and has allegedly incorporated most of industrys positions in its own draft as of october  the osha draft had not been signed by secretary donovan a publication date is therefore unknown the cma draft proposal focuses on material safety data sheets worker training and education programs and workplace hazards communications it is anticipated that these same cma    components will be incorporated into the osha rule but the final standard will most likely be a more complex proposal than that developed by cma occupational safety and health access to records osha stayed parts of the rule on access to employee records to consider confidentiality of trade secrets cma recommended that negotiations with employee representatves not regulations should determine the conditions for allowing access to records with trade secrets moreover cma continues to intervene in the aflcio legal action to prevent further broadening of access to employee records hearing conservation in comments to osha cma recommended that stays be con tinued on the amendment to the occupational noise standard cma made additional suggestions on remaining parts of the standard to permit continued use of hearing conservation programs which have been so successful inthe chemical ndustry i informing primary care physicians about occupational medicine cma cosponsored a pioneering course in cooperation with the american occupational medical association to inform primary care physicians and other health professionals about occupational medicine attendance was good and the presentations were well received reproductive hazards reproductive hazards in the workplace remain a major chemial industry concern in its comments on the interagency regulatory liaison groups risk assessment work plan for control of reproductive hazards cma discussed the complexity and lack of information on this subject targeting cma endorsed osha proposals for targeting safety inspec tions and made suggestions for improvement these included the use of osha recordable injuries and selfreporting of these data to the agency oshc will continue to work with the agency on this matter public risk analysis special committee prasc developed a proposed policy for regulatory impact analysis for health safety and envlronmental chemical regu i cma    latlons the proposed policy addresses all pertinent aspects of regulatory impact analysis of which public risk analysis is one component a cma position on regulatory impact analysis is important because of the potential impact of executive order  on september  cmas board of directors approved the public risk analysis special committees proposed policy on regulatory impact analysis at the semiannual meeting in november cma will recommend to its executive committee and board of directors that prasc sunset and a new committee be formed this new committee the regulatory impact special committee risc will have a charter and objectives more in line with the cma policy on regulatory impact analysis among its several tasks risc will define and develop appropriate methodologies for use in regulatory impact analysis by cma environmental programs regulatory reform cma sent out a letter to cma committee chairmen vice chairmen task group leaders and staff executives requesting their assistance in providing vice president bush with an interim progress report on the accomplishments and remaining tasks of the

his public appeal last month on new proposals to reach his overall budget goals he rejected delays in any of the recently enacted individual tax reductions instead the president proposed to enact new measures to eliminate abuses and obsolete incentives in the tax code these include proposals to restrict or to repeal the use of tax exempt industrial revenue bonds to accelerate the quarterly payment of corporate income taxes to repeal business and individual energy tax credits and to liminate the practice of allowing certain contractors to defer income tax payments until the last year of a multiyear contract in addition the president reemphasized the need to enact legislation for additional user fees on boats barges and private airplanes as anticipated the proposed sources of new tax resources cited by the administration met strong opposition on capitol hill early warning signals from senate finance committee chairman bob dole rkansas indicated that at present a majority of the senate would prefer to postpone the effective date of the reagan individual tax custs from july to october both in  and in  rather than to adopt new taxes so near an election year on the other hand the house democratic leadership for the moment appears willing to allow pressure from the economy to build before directly confronting the presidents program for the moment the presidents options appear to be limited in addressing key factors that are largely beyond his control interest rates revenue flows to the treasury and inflation at this writing the possibility of a major slowdown in economic activity appears to have cooled investor demands for higher interest rates at least for the moment energy natural gas it is currently expected that when a formal administration position on natural gas deregulation is announced it will include a recommendation for accelerated phased decontrol of all natural gas over a three year period the present belief is that an announcement will not be made until budget and economic policy issues have been considered by the congress general principles or guide lines for legislation however may be provided to the congress in order to promote a hearing process this year congressional con sideration will also be influenced by the nearing of the  elections cma   oversight hearings on wellhead prices for natural gas have been scheduled by the senate energy and natural resources committee for november  and  the hearings are expected to focus on problems involved in implementing the natural gas policy act ngpa specifically title i undoubtedly discussion will also include the broader natural gas issues and cma has requested an opportunity to appear no house hearings are expected in the near future but support continues to grow for the major elements of hr  offered by representative phil gramm dtx the cma position and supporting information continues to be provided to key administration officials and congressional members the government relations committee grc energy task group is also preparing to offer a natural gas issues briefing to member company washington representatives possibly in november a natural gas white paper that discusses the issues and chemical industry viewpoints is being developed energy emergency preparedness on september  the senate energy and natural resourc s committee completed markup of legislation designed to deal with a major petroleum shortfall several amendments to s the bill introduced by chairman james a mcclure rid were included in the final version the standby petroleum allocation act of  spaa would provide the president with broad discretionary authorii and offer a list of options in the event of a severe petroleum supply shortage in many respects the reported bill is similar to the expired emergency petroleum allocation act epaa the same priority provisions of the epaa were added including a provision for petrochemicals the bill is ready for senate floor action and activity could occur in late october markup has been delayed in the house energy and commerce sub committee on fossil and synthetic fuels and probably will not be held until sufficient support exists among subcommittee members to report out a bill chowever chairman philip r sharp din die introduce a bill hr  similar in many respects to the unamem senate version the standby authority petroleum allocation act of  differs by not listing specific priority guideline provisions but would require adoption of regulations consistent with the priorities specified in the old epaa the administration remains opposed to the passage of any legislation to deal with an energy emergency cma likewise belie that no legislation is necessary and that free market forces can best allocate resources in the event that legislation appears imminent the cma effort will be to assure recognition of a high priority for feedstocks as in the senate bill environment clean air act amendments the reagan administration is beginning to provide some of the momentum necessary for amendment of the clean air act cma    in late september president reagan reaffirmed the adminis trations keen interest in seeing congress make much needed corrections to the clean air act this year in a letter to senate majority leader howard baker and to house minority leader robert michel the presidents letter described the clean air act as our top priority in the area of regulatory reform and changes in the act as  ssential to the success of our overall economic recovery program since then vice president bush has begun selectively con tacting members of the senate environment and public works committee and the house energy and commerce committee to encourage development of bipartisan legislation in accordance with the  principles announced by efa administrator anne gorsuch in early august senator robert t stafford rvt chairman of the senate committee now has staff working to develop consensus and legislative language for committee markup possibly late in october the committees new pace could be a reflection of the fact that stafford has just announced he is running for reelection and thus seeks closer ties with the administration on october  cma representatives met with the senate committee staff to discuss recently released draft legislative language our representatives emphasized our concern on the prevention of significant det rioration psd proposals but we focused primarily on the hazardous air pollutants porgram proposals section  in the house there has been little movement toward the drafting of a combined mobile and stationary sources bill by chairman john d dingell dmi and ranking minority leader james t broyhill rnc industry hopes to generate interest in introduction of the necessary bipartisan comprehensive legislation following the hearings in the subcommittee on health and the environment which are scheduled through november  cma testimony on recommended improvements regarding psd require ments of the clean air act will be delivered at hearings of the health subcommittee scheduled for october  in addition a detailed statement on all cma recommended revisions will be submitted for the record our clean air act legislative program continues to include active participation in a broad business coalition organized to work for amendments this year we helped develop the coalitions consensus document detailing  basic areas of necessary change in the act to make it work we are cooperating in sharing the document with congressional members and staff in order to show industry unity for prompt action cma   further as part of our objective to generate both public acceptance and more positive media treatment of the need to amend the clean air act a cma action advisory was issued on september  to all member companies urging contact with senators and representatives education of local media local opinion leaders and groups and encouragement of others to help carry the message background materials were provided and supplemental materials are being sent in later mailings environment groundwater policy rep toby moffett dconn september  sent a letter to efa administrator gorsuch criticizing eras lack of action on groundwater protection the moffet letter asked gorsuch to respond by september  with all documents and materials relating to your decision not to issue a national groundwater strategy at this time moffats main concern is that the administration will not continue working on a national groundwater policy guidance docum nt cma testified last year in support of the development of such a groundwater guidance document i in the past moffett has threatened to introduce federal legislation to regulate groundwater if a national policy was not developed within epa moffets subcommittee on environment energy and natural resources of the house government operations committee will conduct an oversight hearing october   to discuss with epa administrator anne gorsuch the status of the groundwater policy  and other issues environment clean water act on september  the house public works and transportation committee completed work on hr  roe dnj to authorize for one year fy   billion for the sewage treatment construction grants program it was expected that rep jim oberstar dmn would offer an amendment that would extend the  date for achieving best available technology bat  the clean water act task group of the government relations committee expressed the following concerns with the oberstar amendment the chemical industry needs a comprehensive review of the clean water act in  these needs go far beyond a simple extension of bat requirements while we support an extension of the  bat date we have a deep concern that the inclusion of such an amendment now will preclude a comprehensive re view of titles  and  next year thus unless we can be assur d that the passage of this amendment now would not preclude a full review of the bill next y ar we would prefer that non construction grant provisions be considered earlv next year j  cma   r an d the task group contacted key members of the public works and transportation committee and expressed these concerns subsequently rep oberstar did not offer his amendment in committee but the construction grants bill hr  could be brought to the house floor by the end of october and mr oberstar is considering offering his amendment at that time the task group will be expressing the chemical industrys concerns with the timing of the oberstar amendment with key members of the house and stressing the need for a comprehensive review of the clean water act in  on september  the senate environment and public works committe completed its work on the construction grants bill s  during the session the committee voted unanimously to repeal the industrial cost exclusion provision the socalled stafford amendment cma submitted a letter supporting the repeal of ice to all members of the environment and public works committee environment superfund developments cma has been granted the right to intervene in the new jersey attorney generals lawsuit on preemption against the federal government judge flannery of the us district court for the district of columbia will now hear the federal governments motion to dismiss the case epa administrator anne gorsuch has recommended to mb that the army corps of engineers be used to assist in the cleanup of hazardous waste dumpsites under superfund rep james florio dnj became concerned about the use of the corps for cleanup and asked cma for its views in a letter to mbs david stockman dated september  cma strongly supported the use of private contractors in the design and construction work required under superfund cma said the corps presently does not have the experienceor trained personnel that will be necessary to conduct the remedial cleanup program called for in superfund rep florio held an oversight hearing on the superfund law july  before his subcommittee on commerce transportation and tourism of the house energy and commerce committee during the hearing florio developed a discussion on joint and several liability with epas gorsuch and department of justices carol dinkins that appeared to confuse the issues cma therefore felt it necessary to submit for the hearing record a legal memorandum on joint and several liability we contend that the failure of congress to pro vide joint and several liability was intentional the cma views were then critized by senator robert stafford rvt in the congres sional record of september  cma   taxation superfund taxes cma has learned that a draft of proposed interpretative regulations on the application of the excise taxes imposed on chemicals and petroleum under the superfund legislation is being reviewed within the internal revenue service we anticipate that the proposed regulations will be moving forward from the irs to the treasury department within the next few weeks international trade exportof hazardous substances president reagan requested from his secretaries of state and commerce on february   proposals for changes in existing notification systems for exports of hazardous substances a large proportion of pesticide exports would be most affected along with products eventually to be restricted under tsca the reagan administration has dropped any plans for control or prohibition of such exports as provided for in president carters executive order which president reagan subsequently revoked since february the commerce and state departments have en countered disagreements in writing the joint response the most serious difference of opinion is through what channels information is to be passed from the us exporter to the country receiving the product the most likely choice at this writing appears to be the us embassy of the receiving country another issue in the joint response will be whether recommendations are made to amend appro t priate sections of existing fifra and tsca laws the cma position that tsca should not be amended for this purpose has been strongly emphasized by our spokesmen the cma has worked closely with government officials during this process of evaluation close liaison with the national agricultural chemicals association and the pharmaceutical manufac

preceding day cma   approved expansion of cmas state affairs program including the addition to staff of two professionals and one support person at an annualized cost of  this is to be accomplished within the current budget reduced by  and within the presently authorized  personnel level e approved the recommendation of the communications committee that the tv ad program be postponed indefinitely dr fernandez then put this decision in perspective by reviewing the history of the communications program including chemcap and advising that rec ommendations will be received from the communications committee involving a significant reduction in print ad expenditures and a change in emphasis in the print ad program e heard a report from finance committee chairman sella the loss of several members will result in a dues shortfall of approximately  this fiscal year which would translate to a budget deficit of about  when combined with the approval of an expanded state affairs program the executive committee will receive recom mendations to control and reallocate expenditures to implement the state affairs program and at the same time avoid the deficit a larger budget deficit in fiscal  could occur if calendar year  sales upon which next years dues are based are lower than originally estimated to anticipate this board members will be contacted in early october for an estimate of  sales this will make better planning possible for fiscal  the preliminary budget for fiscal  will be prepared on the assumption that expenses will be reduced to accommodate about onehalf of the fore casted deficit the other onehalf to be made up from reserves it is hoped there will be some increased interest income which would be helpful specific recommendations will be received at the october meeting of the executive committee in view of the indefinite post ponement of the tv ad program and the contemplated reduction of the print ad program the chemcap special assessment in december will be reduced to approximately onehalf of the originally approved  percent level to reflect the actual forecasted communications ex penses it is planned that this will be the last special assessment since the june dues billing for fiscal  would be adjusted up ward accordingly to reflect the permanent expansion of the public relations effort including special issue advertising which would be at a substantially reduced level from previous ad expenditures this billing which may be looked at as being the sum of the dues plus the special assessment would see a decline from  percent to approxi mately  percent of the previous dues base e heard a report from membership committee chairman caldwell concerning membership retention and recruitment the committee

activity willcontinue to require close attention since legislation on complex issues is rarely coapleted during one session of congress progress on energy issues was however unusually ponderous this year because the budget and other economic issues were given higher priority the reagan administration initiated a policy of greater reliance on market forces to determine fuel choices and to some extent energy prlees and supplies the energy committee also initiated some positive steps toward energy regulatory reform cma energy committee attention is concentrated on the following selected

committee august   good morning my energy committee report is a bit like a good news bad news story the good news has already happened in the year just completed the bad news is waiting to happen in  and it may if we relax our efforts during the current year last year i optimistically titled ay report new horizons anticipating that we had reached a major turning point in federal energy policy that ve could correct the excesses of the past and in particular the overregulation of the carter years and the five part national energy act of  that we could move from supply regulation and demand restriction to supply stimulation through free market pricing knowing that further gains in energy conservation and fuel switching and most importantly market stability and predictability would follow that optimism was based on the election of ronald raagan with his free market energy platform it is useful to review two parts of the energy plank of the  bepublican platform in order to increase domestic production of energy republicans we advocate the decontrol of the price at the wellhead of oil and gaswe also believe that market restrictions on the use of natural gas should be eliminated republicans we understand that a free market based on the collective priorities and judgments of individual consumers will efficiently allocate the energy supplies to their most highly valued users the president has delivered on many of his energy pledges the energy committee likes to think that ve have helped over the past year last year we identified two major items for our energy agenda natural gas deregulation and elimination of inequitable federal allocation schemes for the distribution of crude oil under the emergency preparedness allocation act for emergency preparedness we prepared recommendations and testified before congress and lobbied for no bill to replace the expired epaa while these efforts didnt convince congress that a bill was not necessary we believe they did help to reinforce president reagans resolve that no bill was needed although congress passed the standby petroleum allocation act the president vetoed that bill and in a remarkable turnaround the senate sustained the veto after passing the spaa by a vote of  to  i also reported significant reductions in the regulatory burden of the power plant and industrial fuel use act and this year i can again report even further gains these regulations were one of those identified for vice president bushs regulatory reform task force cwa   in march president reagan ended any chance of congressional action on the deregulation of natural gas when he announced that he would not seek legislation in  while consumer activists and other opponents of deregulation hailed the presidents announcement as a major victory most observers recognized it as a postponement not a solution to the problems of the natural gas policy act and the public debate has continued the energy committee recognized that the debate particularly as reported by the press was not going in ourdirection the exaggerated claims of the consumer activists and other opponents of decontrol were consistently gaining headlines while more rational analyses were being ignored the energy committee commissioned foster associates a nationally recognized natural gas authority and consultant to compare and analyze ten recent studies of natural gas deregulation that varied widely in their findings on the impact of decontrol as you would suspect the conclusions of each study supported the views of the authors foster found two studies decidedly more comprehensive and realistic assessments of total phased decontrol these were by the department of energy and standard oil of indiana conversely foster found three studies predicted exaggerated and unsupportable field price projections and hence contributed little to a constructive analysis of the decontrol issue in march we held a press conference to release the foster study and we followed that with a congressional staff briefing both events were well attended just last month representative dannemeyer from california quoted from our study in the current hearings before the house fossil and synthetic fuels subcommittee in  our energy conservation resumed its upward progress by climbing to  z better than  this is particularly encouraging in light of the stagnant economy our voluntary goal of z appears well within reach it is also of interest to examine how our raw energy consumption has changed since  this table reflects raw energy usage as reported hy our member companies it has not been corrected for production changes significant reductions have been made in fuel oil and natural gas consumption surprisingly coal use is actually down slightly and electricity is up substantially im afraid the answer is washington this is the bad news last year we had two major issues this year we have three natural gas decontrol continues emergency preparedness is in a state of remission and the newcomer is of course energy taxes cma  i  goals and objectives lets examine our plans and goals for each of che major issues first natural gas deregulation the chemical industry consumes over two trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually which is more than  of the total united states consumption and about  of the us industrial use  is our last chance for legislation to be enacted to replace the ngpa before its partial decontrol occurs on january   the administration and congress will be reluctant to address natural gas in  a presidential election year furthermore our worst case risk is no longer just no action it is an extended ngfa our basic position on deregulation is that che ngpa be amended to provide for smooch and predictable phase up of all natural gas wellhead ceiling prices to market clearing levels free market access for all consumers pipelines and distributors to all types of natural gas supplies a coordinated removal of supply and demand restraints including the repeal of the industrial sections of the fuel use act and incremental pricing in order to make significant progress over the coming months in the deregulation debate we must address in detail four areas of controversy firstthe timing of old gas decontrol the interstate pipelines distribution companies and some predominantly interstate consumers are reluctant to give up natural gas access and bidding advantages that they have under the ngfa many are willing to decontrol old gas but not simultaneously with new gas secondis the problem of producerpipeline contracts the interstate pipelines are quite concerned about imprudent contracts that they have signed particularly after the ngpa was enacted that contain price escalator clauses in theory these clauses upon decontrol would increase the price of gas paid by these pipelines beyond market clearing levels the pipelines want legislated protection to prevent this possibility thirdis a windfall profits tax such a tax is a distinct political possibility as a compromise to consumer activist interests and as a source of added federal revenue which may be particularly enticing to a congress facing continued hugh budget deficits we are concerned that full decontrol with an excessive windfall profits tax could well be worse than the ngpa cma  fourthl th severity of price fly up upon deregulation most peoples views on total decontrol of natural gas are directly related to their perception of the magnitude of the price increase that will result the consumer activists have effectively convinced the public that decontrol will devastatetheir personal budgets the press continues to provide front page coverage to these claims while more moderate projections by more knowledgeable parties are deemed not newsworthy most important of all in our effort to obtain deregulation of natural gas is strong support by president reagan we will urge the administration to introduce a deregulation bill early in  or to endorse a bill introduced by a proponent of decontrol our committees action plan includes analyze the national supplydemand outlook for the nation and the chemical industry beyond  continue to present the cma position before congress and the administration develop and distribute news releases and communications packages form coalitions to develop reasonable compromises on the major issues the importance of the coismunlcations effort cannot be underestimated let me cite a few examples of the headline grabbing claims of our opposition frank mckeeunited steelworkers of america natural gas decontrol would more than double current utility bills for consumers and destroy an estimated three million jobs in an already staggering economy millions of americans would have to choose between eating and freezing the aflc executive council has called gas decontrol the most expensive short term income transfer program in the history of the nationone that takes from consumers and gives to the energy companies dr mark cooper of the consumer energy council of america as deregulation drives up fuel prices and inflation dominos will fall throughout the economy output will decrease unemployment will increase productivity will decline gas supplies will decrease and equity will be undermined the council estimates that over the next three years deregulation would cost american workers  to  jobs and  billion in lost wages while raising living costs sharply and cutting up to  billion from the gross national product armed with figures like these and with inflated estimates that total decontrol could raise the average household heating cost from  to  per heating season many citizen action organizations have mounted effective grass roots campaigns to fight decontrol in milwaukee  senior citizens confronted senator kasten then undecided on the issue to sign a pledge against dec ntr  chanting yes or no yes or no the demonstrators demanded that kasten declare his position on accelerated decontrol publicly when kasten declared his opposition to decontrol the demonstrators presented him with a written pledge kasten signed the pledge cma  jusc a few weeks ago che comnictee for economic development and the conservation foundation testified for immediate deregulation before the house fossil and synthetic fuels subcommittee they also recognized the burden this would be on the poor and recommended that  billion be allocated for their needs the consumer federation of america immediately labeled ceds proposal as uttercynicism while we do not anticipate that emergency planning will be a high profile issue during  we must be prepared for that possibility the impact of adverse action could be substantial in the past the chemical industry has not received equitable treatment under crude oil and petroleum product allocation controls particularly for feedstock the chemical industry uses about x of the nations liquid petroleum for feedstocks and an additional despite the presidential veto of the spaa congressional interest in legislation continues its difficult to feel secure about the middle east president reagan recently signed into law legislation requiring that the strategic petroleum reserve fill rate be maintained at  barrels per day and preferably at a target rate of  this legislation also requires that the administration develop a new distribution plan for the spr cma continues to support filling the spr and the utilization of market forces to properly distribute available supplies during a crude oil disruption our committee action steps include monitor emerging state allocation plans to evaluate the need for preemptive federal legislation monitor congressional activity which could lead to spaa type legislative proposals in  work with the department of energy to establish an equitable government plan for distribution of the spr oil in an emergency develop background analysis and communications recommendation to achieve support for the chemical industrys contribution to the national economy in june of this year when both the senate and house were considering an energy tax as a possible part of the recently passed tax bill we lobbied against any energy tax as inflationary inequitable and economically damaging through the increase it would cause to the international balance of trade deficit in letters that we sent to senator wallop and representative sharp we opposed all energy tax proposals and offered total phased deregulation of natural gas as an alternate which would increase federal revenues within the existing tax structure many observers rate the possibility of an energy tax high for  the tax possibilities are shown on this slide our analysis of the various alternate which is still in development ranks them from least impact to greatest impact for a given federal revenue gain as follows an increased excise tax on gasoline a btu excise tax an ad valorum tax and finally an imported and domestic crude oil or refinery tax for perspective the direct gst to the chemical industry of a lod per gallon gasoline tax increase would be quite modest at just a few million dollars annually that tax would raise  b conversely a  per barrel fee on imported and domestic crude oil including imported petroleum products would cost the industry nearly one billion annually cma  our committee plan includes analyze likely tax proposals and develop information to lobby against them particularly the more burdensome energy taxes analyze the effects of a windfall profits excise tax on natural gas with total phased deregulation of gas develop coalitions to continue to oppose burdensome energy taxes and develop feedstock exemption language should an energy tax become inevitable there are secondary issues that we will also address during this year while the fuel use act regulations have been reduced dramatically they still exist we will continue to follow with particular interest the cogeneration exemption and related activity in the federal energy regulatory commission and the litigation in the courts on full avoided cost sale of electric power by industrial cogenerators to utilities and interconnection with utilities also we will be evaluating the administrations proposal to reogranize the department of energy which will be reintroduced in  we will examine the doe budget for industry related portions that could be easily eliminatedin an effort to support federal budget reductions as this slide shows energy rd is best accomplished by industry the caption reads weve done it boss weve learned to get the gasoline out of gasohol finally we will continue to work with the american society of heating refrigeration and air conditioning engineers to further improve their proposed standards for heating and ventilating systems in existing cosmercial and industrial buildings organizational and resource needs a substantial majority of our resources will be focused onnatural gas deregulation energy taxes and emergency planning last year we requested and received substantially increased support from the legal and communications staffs a major effort will be required to enact legislation to achieve total phased deregulation of natural gas this effort will require an additional increase in communication staff support approximately  for a consultant study analyzing the natural gas supplydemand situation through  under the ngpa and its impact on the chemical industry i might note that our current budget for this year is  and an increase in government relations staff support in conclusion we estimate that the energy committee accounts for between  and  z of the cma budget considering the importance and potential impact on the industry of these energy issues we believe that our costbenefit ratio is quite good we appreciate and will continue to need high level commitment of member companiesthrough your contribution of high level managerial talent cma cma

estimate  over  billion a year cma cma  exhibit b supplement remarks to cma board of directors by robert l klausmeier chairman engineering advisory committee august   introduction the engineering advisory committee is concerned with all engineering aspects of chemical manufacturing we do collec tively what would be difficult to achieve individually our scope includes design construction operation and maintenance while there are many other engineering organizations this cma committee is the only one devoted strictly to chemical industry benefits if we dont speak for the chemical industry who will most of our effort focuses on developing national codes and standards which are acceptable to the chemical industry beyond that we sponsor forums on subjects of common interest for example computerized process control systems recently we added improved support of education to our objectives in last years report i talked about our work on piping lectrical installations vessels pumps boilers and relief systems and the codes and standards governing them then i presented an overview of the private sector standards system its organization and critical importance to the chemical industry today i will discuss in detail two subjects i mentioned briefly last year so that you can have a better understanding of the scope of this committee then i will describe our latest venture engineers can be accused of being detail people we are someone must be a chemical plant is made up of millions of details vessels pipes wiring motors pumps valves insulation tubes welds nuts and bolts each must do what it is intended to do and practically all of them are specified by one or more national standards it is a good thing they are if not every company would have to do for itself what has been done collectively can you afford that early in your careers most of you were probably equally concerned with details remember  the details are still there and each one must be handled properly where we can lets do it together cma  electrical codes and standards in past reports you have heard about the work of our electrical codes  standards task group to protect our industrys interest by keeping the national electrical code clean we have millions of dollars at stake the code is amended and reissued on a three year cycle following very involved pro cedures there are roughly  proposals for change to the  code for reissue in  of these response is appro priate on perhaps  and intense effort on  unfortunately we cannot rest on our laurels once we have successfully defended favorable amendments and resisted those which are detrimental the whole process starts again many of the sam issues arise year after year code after code it is not feasible for member companies to face this task individually a concerted effort is essential as far back as  the code has required on electric motors a remote controller disconnecting means capable of being locked in the open position or a manual switch located within sight of a motor to disconnect the motor from its source of supply a pushbutton and remote magnetic switch would be common to eitherinstallation in other words lock it out in a motor control center or disconnect it at the pump in sight of the operator note the underlined word  or it has been propsed before is proposed and probably will be proposed again to change that or to and sounds simple just one more switch a typical pump installation in a hazardous area consists of a motor pump oil immersed pushbutton  straightforward minimum essential remote from the pump is a motor control center push the button at the pump and a magnetic switch in the control center opens also remote is a lockable switch separate from the magnetic switch the magnetic switch is rated for the motor size and can be opened safely under load since these are usually located in areas having less demanding hazard classifications they have less stringent and less expensive design requirements now consider the same pump installation with a safety switch for each motor if the proposed change were adopted this is what would be required hazard rated switch  price   installation cost   total  per motor cma  not only expensive but potentially unsafe if this switch at the pump is opened under load it will arc if not horse power rated it could explode i will leave it up to you to estimate the cost of this unnecessary complication on each new motor installed retro active application has notbeen proposed but some zealot may try it at any time retrofit would cost more like  per motor and a modest size chemical plant will have upward of  such motors process control systems now lets leave the code turnpike try a different road and explore a new area computerized process control systems it is new exciting and underdeveloped sounds like a description of parts of the napa valley but like the valley it has its pitfalls fortunately we have good guides  our process control task group on may  and  the tsk group conducted its third process computer users forum half a day was devoted to distributed control systems unique to this session were presentations by noncompany member people a professor and a journal editor this was followed by discussions of humancontrol system process interface retrofit of existing plants and integrated control systems integrated control systems are those which  combine distributed regulatory control systems and management information systems we have heard the term distributed control systems for the last several years it you are like me you had an idea of what was meant but were a little vague in a simplified distributed system there is something to be controlled for instance a valve a signal is sent this indicates the current condition it is received by the controller where it is analyzed and if necessary corrective action is taken to open close or adjust the valve early analog devices were elementary by todays digital standards the modern controller is much smarter however it neither sees all nor knows all some jobs are too complicated for it to handle a higher capacity central process computer will monitor many parameters as well as signals to and from the controllers it can make far more complex calculations considering input from many sources cma  it can tell the controller what action to take and may even reprogram it to react properly to changed conditions equally important the main computer can be equipped with a voluminous and reliable long term memory it can store process data then in case of an upset it can retrieve and analyze the data to isolate the cause in an integrated system the information is also available to business computers to process management information fortunately for us humans even the central computer needs to be monitored and occasionally corrected so there are still operators but they are operating with far more powerful tools than available before the term distributed is used to describe the distribution of functions to individual controllers versus control directly by a central unit these systems are not only cost effective they look good too the last half day of the forum was devoted to open discussion and a critique of the previous sessions seventyseven people from  companies attended this compares to  at the  forum evaluation sheets showed overwhelming support for another forum comments were consistently favorable we also provided papers for those who couldnt attend the engineering advisory committee reviewed this task groups charter and supports another forum planned for may  this is subject to review and evaluation early next year the explosion a better word is detonation of control technology is more than individual companies can handle cost efficiency dictates cooperation aid to education what should the industry do about the depletion of educational faculty and facilities we dont know but we decided it would be wise to determine where we are before we decide where to go we started with a survey through engineering contacts to find out just how and how much our industry is committing to support of education analysis of returns is underway unfortunately only  companies responded however those  indicated contributions of over  million an impressive number we think this can be used by the communications committee as an image improver we believe that distribution of a summary report of the analysis will encourage increased support though the level of support by individual companies cma  v will be lcept confidential foresighted companies can be recognized as leaders laggards should recognize their short comings and be motivated to catch up no company is so small or so poor that it cannot do its share we will keep you informed and make our recommendations later rnst effectiveness ours is a low cost operation as far as cma is concerned committee size is just large enough to provide a good cross section we have only five task groups they have specific assignments and hold comparatively few meetings our demands on cma staff facilities and dollars are small but we do a job which must be done either within or outside of cma separate company programs to do what we do would cost far more than ours you are getting a good return on your investment our our work is prophylactic not postnatal we prevent rather than react many regulations particularly oshas are based on national standards under new federalism standards prepared by the private sector will be used in more regulations both federal and state wed better be damned sure they say what we want them to say it is better for us to speak up otherwise the fabricators regulators and unions will be free to look after their own narrow interests standards carry legal connotations beyond mere regulation there will be accidents fires explosions and releases no matter how hard we try to prevent them in fact and in court we must be certain that we have followed accepted industry practice codes and standards equal good practice lets do the job together we cant afford to stand alone now heres what you have all been waiting for cma cma  i exhibit c executive summary government relations committee report to the cma board of directors august   early sections of the report of the government relations committee are devoted to its role membership and organization th committee is the focal point of the coordinated legislative activities of the chemical industry in washington through th cooperative efforts of a highly professional community of washington representatives the government relations committee is able to provide a service which offers to cma and its vari ous program elements monitoring of key issues advice during policy making legislative strategy development and political analysis direct legislative communications programs where the importance of issues have dictated the appointm nt of a committee keyman or formation of a task group the staff executivesupport function is provided by a member of the professional staff of the cma government relations depart ment special activities section ivof the report describes the cma briefing break fast and the chemical forum luncheon series both aimed at promoting interaction between industry washington representatives encouraging participation and keeping them abreast of develop ments on current issues the chemical forum also serves to enhance the reputation and recognition of cma in the nations capital since it features addresses by respected and widelykn wn public figures last years objectives and progress these are detailed in section v with much emphasis being plac d on widening participation and sharpening internal proce dures  i cma  issues section vi provides a series of reports by keymen and task group chairmen on important issues which occupy the attention of the government relations committee during this year these issues represent the work product on which this committee pro vides overall legislative service and leadership for cma ad vocacy legislative timetable and priorities section vixis a chart which represents a new approach by the government relations committee in identification and prior itization of key issues the committee believes that this pro cess should be completed and formalized for all of the cma pro gram it will be noted that the committee believes that constit uent communication will be especially appropriate and productive in the issues of the clean air act the clean water act natural gas deregulation and superfundcercla similarly legislative communications priorities seem to coincide in the areas of the clean air act the clean water act natural gas deregulation the occupational safety and health act and superfundcercla committee plans and objectives section viii explains three areas where doing better would seem likely to produce important dividends for the chemical in dustry linking legislative and communications efforts more directly more effective coalitioning and the focusing of con stituent influence in the area of communications and public understanding the committee is forming a task group to create more interaction between communications professionals and government relations professionals identify priorities set timetables develop new messages target communications programs to congressional districts with regard to coalitions the government relations committee plans to discourage creation of new organizations to handle co alition efforts on issues and at the same time to encourage more  cma  i r attention to the coalitioning process in the larger umbrella business organizations in order to promote a sharper focus on constituent commu nications with specific key congressmen the government rela tions committee has begun efforts to identify legislative issues which best lend them selves to constituent communications identify communications issues from a similar perspective survey the constituent contacts capabilities of member companies identify congressional committees which handle the most important bills develop more detailed home district data on congressmenwho serve on key committees develop a voting record evaluation of key mem bers of congress cma cma  exhibit c supplement remarks to cma board of directors by robert e hampton chairman government relations committee august   i am pleased to have this opportunity to present the annual grc report x would like to call your attention to the written report previously dis tributed to you particularly section v    committee objectives and progress section vi keymens report on the substantive issues and section vii major legislative issues timetables and priorities as i will not cover these matters in my presentation last year we reported on the implications of the political changes brought about by the election of president reagan and a republican senate and how these changes might impact on the chemical industry effect the role of the grc and our legislative efforts we mentioned that the economic issues taxes budget cuts and social security reform would dominate the time and attention of both the administration and congress and that we did not expect major environmental or health legislation to pass in  in addition we stated that these issues would be put off until  bringing them into consideration during an election year thus making it even more difficult to achieve substantial amendments we also stated that this did not mean that efforts should not be made to amend key legislation but we had to be realistic about our chances for success we pointed out that significant legislation might be set aside and no final action taken until  this now appears to be the case we are greatly disappointed that the seemingly favorable political makeup of the administration and congress did not produce results but what has happened was not totally unexpected however we are continuing to work for comprehensive changes in a number of laws and the organizational objectives we achieved last year place us in a much stronger position to advocate change than in the past by a more systematic focus on strategy and planning improving communications and coordination within the cma structure and continuing efforts to educate members of congress and administration officials with wellreasoned positions and good backup data positions on the issues have been changing for the better it is against this background that the grc critiqued its activities and developed our objectives for the coming year the major question we asked ourselves was how can we do better and what are the things we have to do to be better cma  we examined the various factors that impact upon the legislative process and the roles various institutions play in influencing that process the media public understanding of the chemical industry and media influence on congress business coalitions in washington cma the grc itself washington representatives and the industry the chemical industry and its political clout chemical industry issues and priorities i would like to cover just two of those factors first one of the essential ingredients in setting the scene for achieving legislative success is communications why is it when our industry advocates changes in legislation that the public perceives it as an attempt to gut a law that protects them and the environment and that our sole reason for wanting change is cost why does this misconception carry over to the congress which gives us sympathy and understanding but out of fear of public opinion will not vote to support responsible changes that are well justified on the merits and by good science the main reason is the single message persistently carried by the media influenced by environmental groups that industryadvocated changes gut the law and that industry wants change only to save money this oversimplified easytostate message substantiated by a few isolated examples from the past but presented as a generalization has created a total misconception of the chemical industry to accomplish our industrys legislative goals the grc feels it is essential that we take the necessary actions to clear up these miscon ceptions by better coordination of our communications program with our legislative goals we will identify those issues of importance prioritize them set goals and timetables assist in developing communications that are effec tive in the legislative arena and create a new sense of direction and urgency the grc will take action jointly with the conmunications committee to deal with the issues we have voted to form a task group on legis lativecommunications to oversee these activities and through this group target communicationsrelated projects the second essential ingredient is what we referred to in our report as us the chemical industry has considerable political clout if you want to call it that but we are not sure that this clout is being used in the most effective way this is a sensitive area and one we are hes cma  cant to discuss because it could be misinterpreted as interfering with this is not the case we are all in the same boat on these issues even though legislation may impact differently on individual companies we are all affected by the passage of legislation that calls for further regulation of our industryso we either sink or swim together what we will be trying to do is prudently direct and utilize this clout to accomplish our legislative objectives internal company business we plan a number of actions to gather information on just where the industry stands and the details of these activities are spelled out in section viii of our report we will need your personal commitment and support in this effort another sensitive area i would like to mention is ceo involvement in this process there are times where certain highlevel contacts must be made within the administration or with the congressional leadership some cases this already has been done it is our opinion that we can only achieve credibility at that level by representation from the top the hired guns can go only so farthen the system calls for bringing in the big guns on specific issues where an appropriate relationship exists this involvement will be requested through the proper cma channels and here again we ask you commitment we believe the committee plans and objectives for  and  of im proving communications working in coalitions and focusing on influence energetically pursued will go a long way toward enhancing our chances of achieving our legislative goals a look at the future t as far as the executive branch is concerned we are being listened to and we have not been faced with a flow of new regulations deregulation has not produced the changes we had hoped for but there has been improvement this takes time the reform movement has lost some momentum as efa and to a lesser degree osha have baen under political attack this is apparent in legislation being considered by congress in that a number of amendments to various laws are designed to force epa into taking action or handcuffing them where they have used their discretion on issues the environmentalists hold dear action by the administration in lobbying for changes in environmental legislation is invisible the white house is keenly aware that public opinion holds little sympathy for amendments to environmental health and safety laws and is keeping a low profile on the issue the bottom line is that we cannot expect too much executive branch support on environmental legislation at this time also we should be alert to the signals that the white house is concerned about its image on cma  environmental issues and in order to neutralize this issue we can expect some administrative action regulatory to show their concern for those issues as far as congress is concerned the votes in the house on fifra and clean air in the house and senate causes great concern many months of work with the congressional committees in hammering out compromises have easily gone down to defeat on the floor of congress because of the emotional and political climate that exists today what we are seeing today is a number of battles in a war where the outcome is still in doubt at this stage we do not expect any major environmental legislation to pass this session of congress look at forecast on specific issues in section vi this forecast could change as the politics of the issues are so complex it is difficult to give a precise reading however there will be little time to deal with these issues between the time congress returns september  and adjourns the first week in october we are continuing to work for comprehensive and constructive changes in the laws being considered and this pressure is having the effect of extending the debate what about    we believe most of these issues will be addressed in  what will be the political situation at that time the outcome of the  elections will determine the character of the next congress there are as many opinions on what the character might be as there are people who make predictions we arent qualified to predict but some experts do not feel the change will be all that significant republicans are predicted to maintain control of the senate and will not loose a significant number of seats in the house a key factor in    impacting on legislation will be the shape of the economy and the jobs issue since  is a presidential election year what takes place in  will determine the issues of the  election and what congress and the administration believes to be public opinion will bias consideration of environmental health and safety legislation this is one of the reasons we believe our communications efforts are crucial we cannot be sure of the answers to those questions at this time we can only be sure that under any set of political circumstances our goals will not be easy to attain we are confident that the approach we have developed to deal with these issues will serve us well under any circumstances and in the long haul lead to success we will not be disappointed if legislation is not passed during this congress because in most cases what is being considered is worse than or little better than what now exists to say that the situation will only get worse next year could be interpreted as meaning we do not have much confidence in our positions and we should not accept that cma cma  i exhibit d executive summary of the environmental management committee report to the cma board of directors august   major accomplishments the environmental management committees emc  year was full diverand productive the committee effectively managed environmental issues before regulatory agencies congress and federal courts in addition a greater commitment of resources was made to assist in the rapidly expanding state affairs program a summary of the committees major accomplishments is set forth in chapter x these accomplishments include the following o after three years of extensive negotiations cma epa and other parties concluded a settlement agreement on  of  issues raised as part of litigation challenging the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes implementing regulations the settlement agreement is highly favorable to industry and will result in effective control of our discharges to the nations waters o over the last year and a half cma sianaged a cooperative study with epa to ascertain the removal efficiency of toxic organic pollutants by existing chemical industry biological treatment facilities the consultants report of the study concluded that well designed and operated biological treatment inplace is doing an excellent job in removing toxic organic pollutants from chemical wastewaters ie over  percent removal cma developed a radio show and tv news feature about the report and has conducted seven media tours on water o the emc continued a major resoureeintensive effort in conjunction with the government relations committee to have the clean air aet amended amendments are necessary to obtain relief from bureaucratic and costineffactive requirements presently in the act at this time it is difficult to predict when and in what form such amendments will be enacted the emc worked with the communications committee to pro vide spokesmen for clean air media tours in  cities o cma has been extensively involved in discussions with epa and other concerned parties over epas implementing regulations for subpart c of rcra concerning hazardous wastes over the past year the emcs efforts have begun to bear fruit epa now recognizes the chemical industrys concern that the regulatory system not be a disincentive to internal reuse and recycling of wastes and will revise its defini tion of solid waste to essentially exclude such wastes from the hazardous waste system and epa has revised the mixture rule by redefining which wastewater streams are hazardous thereby removing  chemical industry surface impoundments from the system industrys approach will result in effective reduction in hazardous waste and more effective use of byproducts in waste streams cma  research and consulting th total fy  budget for emc research and consulting projects was  actual expenditures totaled  and are detailed on pages  through  the research and consulting budget for fy  is  program outlook although it might seem that there should be a trend toward decreasing activity in the environmental arena this is not the case epa staff are slowly adopting some of the messages espoused by top agency administrators our continued input to epa is required to guarantee progress during this time that is generally viewed as store cooperative than adversarial all levels at the agency are requesting industry input to their prograsts a positive response by industry will require even store stember company and staff resources than in the past our continued regulatory efforts can result in more costeffective regulations for industry that can also result in a substantially improved environment the emc will be challenged during the next year to respond to the epa and to adequately support legislative and judicial issues as they arise we will need resources to respond to possible amendments to the clean air act clean water act resource conservation and recovery act and the safe drinking water act there may be litigation related to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and many familiar environmental issues will become important at the state level we will there fore be in a continuous process of setting priorities and concentrating our resources where they will have the greatest likelihood of positive impact on the industry cma iii cma  r exhibit d supplem nt remarks to cma board of directors by will d carpenter chairman environmental management committee august   earlier this year in a conversation with the chairman of the board i consented that in the environmental arena a perfect score is zero and  food score is a small negative number its probably not that bad but vc aust run hard to stay in the same place the environmental management committee has several key messages to bring to the board and x appreciate this opportunity to address the environmental issues that impact the chemical industry last year tyne jaeschke the emc chairman made several obser vations about theyear ahead to this group  the year we have just completed his remarks are a useful point of departure emc identified nine issues we felt would require the major part of our resources those issues included of course the caa legislative report the water permits program and related water regulation were second followed by rcba and superfund issues ve then listed several crosscutting issues common to all or several of the above regulatory reform good science economic consideration of regulation and the state issues were the major crosscutting issues in retrospect the emc members and cma staffers can be pleased with their crystal ball with  hindsight we dont need to change one the next part of my presentation is to answer the obvious questionif you were so smart about predicting the issues what did you do about them first let me say that the emc was adequately resourced by the b ard we had good support from the member companies and the staff delivered for us time and time again we managed our resources well our outside expenditures were  of budget  was expended as planned the remainder was shifted to more urgent higher priority projects that surfaced during the year as we constantly monitored our resources to ensure maximum effectiveness there were a number of accomplishments that are worthwhile discussing ve selected six that are among the most significant as one analyzes these results we can very nicely use them to give you a better insight into how emc does its work in addition to the type of results obtained t of the six results reported here two have to do with water one vitb air and three with solid waste  one rcra and two superfund cma  national pollutant discharge elimination system regulations npdeswater permits after three years of extensive negotiations cma epa and other parties have concluded a settlement agreement on  of  issues raised as part of litigation challenging the npdes implementing regulations the settlement agreement is highly favorable to industry the key points are as follows permit application requirements have been reduced there is a substantial increase in flexibility for calculating more favorable numerical permit limitations which should result in reduced treatment costs procedures for challenging permit conditions will be more reasonable this should reduce the cost and manpower needed to secure acceptable final permit conditions and dischargers will have increased flexibility in avoiding noncompliance penalties when violations occur as a result of inadvertent or unknown circumstances fourteen of the reauining issues have been set aside for litigation later during appropriate permitting cases as a result the actual number of issues to be briefed with the court of appeals has been limited to a reasonable number thereby achieving our secondary objective of reducing cost of managing the issue cmaepa fiveplant study over the last year and a half cma and epa jointly managed a co operative fiveplant study to ascertain the removal efficiency of toxic organic pollutants by existing chemical industry biological treatant facilities in a recent cma consultants report on the study it was found that current inplant biological treatment is doing an excellent job in removing toxic organic pollutants from cheatical waste waters over  percent removal of toxics was achieved the study provides epa with the best longterm data on the removal efficiency of biological treatment for toxic organics and should play a key role in epas develop ment of effluent guidelines for the organic plastic and synthetic chemical industry we hope epa will use this data to conclude that no additional technology beyond current welldesigned and operated biological treatment is needed to define bat best available control technology economically achievable much of our effort this next year will be devoted to this task clean air act amendments as you all know a lot of emcs effort over the last two and a half years has been directed at clean air act amendments with the government relations committee we have been pursuing a strategy to obtain relief fr m current bureaucratic constraints in the act and to obtain more costeffective clean air programs cma  many of the reforms we are seeking have been adopted at one time or another by the house committee these include better psd and nonattainment program and streamlined sip procedures it is important that we get a bill through with these improvements at the same time there are problems principally in the hazardous air pollutants area the antiindustry coalition bss demonstrated far greater impact than industry or the administration had anticipated it is clear that this part of the act will be changed whenever amendments are passed ve are working hard now to make sure these changes include needed improvements while protecting our industrys interests rcra implementing regulations cma over the past several years has been extensively involved in discussions with epa and other concerned parties over epas implementing regulations for subpart c of rcra concerning hazardous wastes several of the discussions were in fact settlement negotiations of outstanding judicial challenges to the prior administrations implementing regulations that were technically incorrect or that imposed inappropriately stringent requirements that offered no commensurate environmental benefits over the past year the emcs efforts have begun to bear some significant fruits one example is epas recognition of the chemical industrys number one concern that the present regulatory system inappropriately created a dis incentive for the chemical industry to internally reuse and recycle wastes epa is now finalizing a proposed revision of its definition of solid waste that will rectify this concern by essentially excluding industry internal reuse and recycling of wastes from the hazardous waste system a second example is the agencys revision of the mixture rule by redefining which wastewater streamsare hazardous this modification removes  chemical industry surface impoundments from the hazardous waste system  of which would probably have needed replacement hazardous waste site management plan pursuant to directions from the board that the hazardous waste response center direct its efforts to assistance for member companies in disposal site cleanup the task group has managed the preparation and publication this spring of the definitive work on waste site sunagement entitled a hazardous waste site management plan the document has been designed to aid in the development of site management plans for clean up of sites and to assist in mitigating any potential or actual adverse environmental effects the site management plan is being used by member companies and federal and state agencies as a critical management tool in resolving health andor environmental problems created by hazardous wastes in inactive disposal sites superfund implementation as you are all well aware superfund and its implementation is an exceedingly high priority issue for the emc and the chemical industry the resource commitment we have made to date in order to obtain a reasonable implementation of superfund has definitely been a costeffective decision in this regard epa has just recently promulgated cma  the final revisions to the national contingency plan these are con sistent vith the positions that cma has advocated on this natter the key points are no dtal standard for cleanup between fund financed versus privately financed cleanup fund financed cleanups should generally be tied to the priority list of sites and a flexible standard as to how clean a site would have to be under a superfund cleanup initiative although several significant issues still remain to be addressed ie mining site cleanup funding state superfund preenption tort law and waste end studies the industry advocacy effort has resulted thus far in aore reasonable iapleaentation by epa than first indicated after this brief description of six key issues  would like to use a few slides to give you an insight into the aanageaent of issues by the emc ve will focus on areas qf impact resources and results in each slide the issues are listed on the left in the first slide the area of impact is indicated on the right the areas listed are obvious however it is of interest that the emc with cma staff moves effectively across these four areas with a large number of issues as you can see from the slide frequently our efforts have impact in more than one of these four in the next slide the same six issues are listed again to show the key resources used for each of the six of course cma staff is involved in every action but the comparative effort varies from issue to issue in the final two slides we focus on the bottom line justifications are arbitrarily broken into four listings once again we can win in more than one way as an aside we must improve on expressing our actions in terms of positive impact on the environment for instance the plant study shows that procedures already in place have reduced pollutants in water by hundreds of thousands of tons over that expected by epa the industry and the administration are interested in costeffective regulation  as well we should but the public wants to hear what happens to the environment ve must provide that information for our own interest and learn to do it routinely  in our formal comments on legislation and regulation in our casual discussions with the influence people as well as our chemcap program now let us look ahead using the previous format i will discuss the legislative area first in the coming year we can expect amendments to rcra and the cva which are already underway before the next annual report the legislative effort on cescla will be underway vith the caa still uncertain cma  with the makeup and mood of congress presently and in the next year we anticipate ve will be swinging upstream given the other option of sinking however we shall continue to paddle like hell with good technical support and policy guidance through emc we expect to reach our goal of costeffective environmentally responsible regulations the regulatory arena will be active for virtually every major environmental law as wayne jaeschke reported last year it was demonstrated that it takes more effort and resources to participate in a cooperative regulatory atmosphere than it does to object in the hostile environment that existed two years ago now is our chance to be part of the solution the emc thinks there are several watchouts during the coming year some are issuerelated  others are crosscutting let me list some of those groundwaterits hard to predict when a groundwater incident will be used against industry the way pcbs love canal and others did to catalyze tsca and superfund a crosscutting issue is emc members impression of disturbing congressional attitudes on a key subject the banner of good laws and regulations based on good science does not have the isipact on congress that it once did some members of congress are claiming that this is merely an excuse to delay implementation of regulations although the government relations group is responsible for our congressional arena the emc bases its efforts on the underlying principle of good science we must meet this challenge successfully in addition to the federal issues state issues will demand effort from emc members with superfund and disposal sites being major examples national ambient air quality standards naaqsozone revisited for s superfund implementationwill be a continuing area of effort some important issues will be in litigation including litigation in which cma may participate many cleanups will be underway and some completed data will need to be compiled for future efforts to sunset the fund  assistance to state groups on state legislation  tort law with a substantially reduced budget we must select our priorities carefully and review our progress and needs to determine how to organize and direct our efforts we must improve in our coordination with other cma groups such techniques as teleconferences fewer only needed people at meetings elimination of some meetings and better coordination of meetings will be necessary i our requests to you as a result of the written report which you have received and this presentation are i cma  an understanding of the issues end appreciation of the situations an insight into the longterm nature of our work whether legislative regulatory or what the effort extends over several years and the needfor adequate resources in the bad years is there when our resources are limited we become more vulnerable to poorly conceived and executed governmental programs we have to stay active in such times and carefully set our priorities recognition that environmental issues activities will continue to accelerate through  perhaps most importantly we ask for your support in maintaining member company participation at an effective level well try to improve their effectiveness during these tough times we ask that you find the ways to make these outstanding people available  can assure you that you get no better return for your money anywhere for costeffective regulatory management emc efforts are

eec inventory of existing substances and a limit of three years of confidentiality for nondangeroue new substances notified by manufacturers or importers to member states at lags request the trade representatives office asked eec formally for resolution of this potential trade barrier this interest is intense but concentrated in only a few sianufacturers of iladditives photographic film and specialty polymers some europeans are supportive but think the effort futile given the eecs administrative limits and the potential difficulties in amending the  directive sixth amendment scs formal

h report to the cma board of directors on international trade activities august   presented by leo h johnstone vice chairman phillips petroleum company international trade issues continue to be an area of high activity as reported before the current recession has promoted various types of pro tectionisms all around the world the gatt ministerial meeting to be held in november will be extremely important for setting the direction of international trade in the s a prime item on the u s agenda for that meeting is to obtain a recommitment to free trade as well as to complete certain items left over from the tokyo round in addition it is planned that the gatt agreements be expanded into services such as banking insurance engineering and con struction plus an investment code and expansion and redefinition of the generalizations system of preferences trade relations with europe are not at their healthiest state in view of the us sanctions regarding the soviet gas pipeline and the countervailing duty decision regarding steel imports into the united states from europe on the other hand the gatt ministerial could not come at a more appropriate time from the standpoint of trying to head off conditions which could escalate into trade retaliation and a re enactment of the smoothawley bill of the s which magnified and prolonged the great depression there are just a few items i would like to touch on to day which are covered generally in your briefing book some of which deserve some expansion  the petrochemical discussions there have been no more developments in regard to further discussions with the eec although there continues to be some antidumping activities the european chemical industry appears to be more preoccupied with internal condi tions in seeking means of rationalizing the significant overcapacity that exists there has been considerable activity regarding prepara tions for talks with mexico including direct governmenttogovernment tn setting the stage plus two meetings with the department of commerce by the panel of advisors from a number of cma member companies the advisors that your and other cma companies have made available are in deed knowledgeable and experienced and are making significant contribu tions the greatest challenge at this time is to define objectives and reach a consensus on objectives among the advisors and with the department of commerce work is proceeding along these lines and the international trade committee of the cma is actively pursuing this the first meeting with the government of mexico has been scheduled for sometime in october however i made a trip to mexico recently and the task force of the international trade committee has considered the matter and we are recommending to the department of commerce that the cma  october meeting be deferred until sometime after the first of december when the new government of mexico takes office it is not felt that meetings prior to that time would be productive the present chaotic economic conditions in mexico are also a factor in this recommendation there have been no meetings held with japan although we con tinue to hear that a meeting will be requested by them it is also possible that sometime in the near future we will get a similar re quest from canada  competitive assessment studies are being conducted by the international trade commission and independently by the department of commerce regarding the u s petrochemical industry the purpose of these studies is to attempt to assess the impact of actions and policies by other governments on the competitiveness of the u s chemical industry and are significant to us in that they will no doubt form the basis for the attitude of the u s government regarding our petrochemi cal industry in trade negotiations in the future a number of companies have been asked for inputinto these studies and we will hopefully be able to see early drafts in order that inaccuracies and misunderstand ings are not promulgated  a very significant item which is coming from various direc tions including the industry policy advisory committee as well as through other channels is the dangerous and insidious vredeling proposal being considered in the eec governmental system while most of you may be familiar with the vredeling proposal i find that some are not so i would like to describe it briefly this proposal would be a directive regarding workers rights in the community which extends from ec practice of local information exchange and consultation to the world stage it would require annual disclosure of information by management to employee representatives and prior consultation with labor representatives cover ing major corporate worldwide activities and decisions including mergers shifts in production plant closings and even introduction of new tech nology into existing plants this directive is for companies employing at least  employees in ec countries it would require that each year the parent  s company would submit information to the management of its ec subsidiaries which would in turn provide it to the local union labor representatives covering the parent companys worldwide activities related to its economic and financial situation the possible develop ment of the business products and sales it would include production and investment programs manufacturing and working methods including new working methods technological innovations and health and safety the subsidiaries would be required to consult with the employee repre sentatives at least  days prior to any corporate decision which is likely to have a substantial affect on the employees interest with a view to reaching agreement on the measure planned the company must post pone any decision until the union opinion is received or until the day period has elapsed in addition employees at any other subsidiary than the one directly affected may also demand tobe consulted the proposed cma  i directive also contains provisions under which the employee representa tive is authorized to open consultation with the parent company manage ment under a bypass provision the employee representative will be granted appeal rights to tribunal or other national authorities in the event a management fails to fulfill the provisions of the directive this of course has numerous drawbacks which include an extraterritorial reach giving unions the ability to negotiate with multinational com panies on global corporate plans and at the corporate rather than the individual plant level it could involve submission of data which may be in violation of securities law and sec regulations access to corporate confidential or proprietary information and establishing a precedent guaranteeing worker consultation on an international basis this directive is now before the european parliament for a vote the week of september  the ec commission are to reconsider and proba bly redraft the directive for consideration by the ec council of ministers in mid to late  if adopted the individual member states would be required to implement the directive through national legislation this directive has become highly political and represents a major priority for the european trade confederation which has effectively lob bied for it business lobbying on vredeling in the u s is coordinated through the national foreigh trade council the u s council for inter national business the  s chamber of commerce and the nam initially the lobbying took the form that this proposal is so bad that it should simply be discarded present wisdom is that since some form of vredeling will be adopted lobbying should take the form of attempting to revise the proposal to something that can be lived with ivor richard of great britain is the commission member who will be in charge of the redrafting and is the guru of the vredeling proposal having inherited this role from vredeling upon the latters retirement richard has indicated in speeches and other discussions that he is flexible as to the final form at the present time the cma position regarding vredeling is being formulated and should be forthcoming in the near future however in the meantime i would urge you to become more familiar with this proposal and its potentially harmful effects cma cma  exhibit i international trade petrochemical discussions the state of the international petrochemical markets has caused unpre cedented government to government discussions about petrochemicals three eecus talks were held the departtnent of commerce is preparing for talks with the mexican government one discussion on petrochemicals has occurred between the us and japanese governments with additional talks in prospect competitive assesmnent studies the international trade commission is investigating the impact of petro chemical production by oilproducing nations on the us petrochemical industry independently the department of commerce is preparing a competitive assess ment study of the us petrochemical industry as a special project at the be hest of secretary baldrige legislation the growing concerns of the us congress about trade problems are illus trated in senator danforths bill s  the reciprocal trade and invest ment act of  its provisions may well affect trade intellectual property  rights and investment of the us chemical industry vredeling proposal it is likely that a directive will be issued in  or  market that will affect us subsidiaries operating there it is vredeling

in fiscal  overcoming almost impossible odds senate finance committee chairman bob dole rkans held his troops together in the senate to pass a threeyear  billion tax increase shortly before the fourth of july the house democratic leadership confounded longtime washington observers by electing to go immediately to conference on the senate tax bill without attempting to adopt improving amendments the conservative revolt against the tax bill that failed to materialize in the senate showed initial signs of strength in the house led by congress man jack kemp rny the early opponnents of the senate tax program included many of the same representatives who supported passage of the presidents  tax program just as several key business trade organizations announced their opposition to major segments of the senate bill the president committed the prestige of his office and his special powers of friendly persuasion to encourage recalcitrant congressmen to support passage of the senate tax program the senate finance tax package represented a significant retreat from the business tax reforms adopted in  both senate finance committee chairman dole and senate budget committee chairman domenici rnm emphasized these changes were needed to reduce the level of projected federal deficits over the next three years several provisions in this package would place added tax burdens on capital intensive industries especially the chemical industry meeting in marathon negotiating sessions housesenate conferees reached a conference agreement which was remarkably close to the package reported by the senate finance committee the most important provisions of the conference agreement affecting capital formation included o reduction of acrs depreciation and investment tax credit the conference agreement would reduce the basis of property for acrs purposes by onehalf the amount of the investment tax credit andor energy tax credit in general the effect of this provision would be to reduce the value of the invest ment tax credit from  percent to approximately  percent as alternative businesses could continue to take full acrs benefits provided the amount of the investment tax credit was reduced to  percent cma  the maximum amount of tax that can be offset by the investment tax credit would be reduced from  ta  percent of actual tax liability i most importantly the accelerated rates of acrs recovery now scheduled for property placed in service after  would be repealed to chemical companies this was the most important single feature of the  tax legislation o o minimum tax and reduction of corporate tax benefits including disc in addition to the present corporate minimum tax the conference agreement would reduce certain enumerated corporate tax benefits including disc deferrals by  percent section  possessions corporations credit limited j i the section  possessions corporations credit affecting investment by us corporations in puerto rico would be severely restricted in addition the bill would require acceleration of corporate estimated tax payments and would impose additional limitations on corporate pension contributions and benefits the conferees rejected a last minute effort of a business coalition to reduct the bills impact on capital formation and corporate aftertax earnings at present there appears to be no enthusiastic reception from house democrats for any proposal to compromise on this issue in addition there is concern that if action is not taken to reduce acrs this year the budget deficits projected for  and  would be unacceptably high clean air acti outlook bleak for helpful amendments as of august  clean air act amendments are being considered by both the senate environment committee and the house commerce committee in an effort to report bills before the august congressional recess the house markup of hr  resumed august  focussing on section   the point at which chairman john dingell dmi had recessed markup on april  chairman dingell and ranking minority member james t broyhill rnc had said that continuation would depend upon resolution of four issues  prevention of significantdeterioration psd acid rain mobile sources and hazardous air pollutants section  the dingellbroyhill leadership worked with a group j i cma  of swing vote members to produce a compromise package which they hoped would result in a safe margin of votes more democrats were especially needed besides the four who have voted with dingell previously despite the prospect of only a total of  democrats in support of a com promise package dingell indicated the first week of august that markup would resume and the legislative language of the compromise finally was released the cma environmental management committee task group assessment of the two parts of the compromise on which cma has an official position was  on the issue of psd the compromise was much better than present law and  on section  the compromise was within emc policy guidelines cma participated in the clean air working group effort to secure votes for the leadership com promise  on section  the amendment was to be offered by congressman thomas a luken doh the luken language would amend the april  broyhill substitute to florios amendment which provided for automatic listing of substances under section  the outcome on august  was defeat of the broyhillluken substitute by to   abstention the final vote was on adoption of the florio amendment amended by congress man w j billy tauzin dla to provide for a delisting procedure after automatic listing the tauzinflorio language passed  chairman dingell later told a group of industry labor and administration representatives that he must move ahead despite the defeat on section  in the senate the situation in the committee on environment and public works is far from encouraging to date there has been little positive benefit in amendments on nonattainment and virtually nothing useful in the psd and ambient standardsetting secondary amendments in addition an acid rain amendment passed  on july  providing for  million tons reduction in annual emissions of sulfur dioxide in  years while the amendment will directly impact the electric power industry it will indirectly affect all companies utility bills to date the committee has not dealt with section  in markup committee staff have been interested in the language of a bill by senator bennett johnston dla s  introduced july  it provides for automatic listing of substances without specifying the  currently under review by epa if the senate committee does not draw from senator johnstons amendment or the floriotauzin amendment in the house it could decide to approve the pending committee print which is also highly undesirable clean air working group efforts are under way for introduction of a positive comprehensive bill on the senate floor if the current bill is reported out of the environment coimnittee a comprehensive bill could be crafted from the garn byrd and rieglelevin bills none of which have been considered in the stafford committee cma  clean water act legislation the administration has racantly sent its package of comprehensive clean water act amendments to congress for consideration this year cma has a number of major concerns with the administrations package first it does not address bat modification second it maintains national categorical standards for pre treatment third it establishes administrative penalties and felony sanctions another major issue to be considered during the clean water debate but not contained in the administrations proposal is the establishing of federal common law cma is strongly opposed to a part of the clean water act amendments the senate environment and public works subcommittee on environmental pollution chaired by senator john chafee rri held hearings on july    and  cma represented by mr monte throdahl monsanto company testified on july  and focussed primarily on the bat modification issue senator chaf subcommittee is not expected to begin markup until midseptember on the house side the public works and transportation subcommittee on water i resources chaired by representative robert roe dnj held hearings on the clean water act on july   and  qa was once again represented by mr throdahl we presented an indepth explanation of the history and success in implementing best available technology bat chairman roe entered into an extensive discussion with mr throdahl on the bat issue which clearly indicated that the congressman fully understands and appreciates the need for flexibility in the application of bat to avoid treatment for treattnents sake representatii roes subcommittee is not expected to begin markup until september cma has initiated an extensive media effort on clean water legislation  we are also working with the business communitys clean water coalition organized under the washington environmental coordinating cosmittee wecc pending amendments to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the house energy and commerce consnittee has reported hr  which contain a number of amendments to the resource conservation and recovery act which are of concern to cma the bill was then referred to the house public works and transpor tation committee for consideration of section  hazardous wastes mixed with domestic sewage and section  national groundwater coamission mr jeff zimmerman occidental petroleum corporation testified on behalf of cma on may  before the public works committee on june  the public works committee report hr  with changes to these two sections that would delete the reference to rcra in section  and would expand the groundwater study beyond hazardous waste contamination the accompanying report no  part ll also raises many of the concerns expressed in cma testimony during the same time period house commerce subcommittee staff was meeting to attempt to address several issues raised by cma and other groups on june   cma  i congressman florio dnj introduced hr  in response to these issues the bill which representative florio says he will offer as a floor amendment to hr  would change the word substances back to hazardous wastes in section  burning and blending of hazardous wastes as fuel and section  beneficial use of hazardous waste these changes will satisfy a serious concern of cma commerce committee chairman dingell dmich has requested and been granted an open rule which means hr  could be considered on the house floor before the august congressional recess this could allow floor amendments to resolve additional concerns expressed by cma and other groups including revisions to section  small generator exemption section a final permitting conditions and section  creation of federal common law in a new development representative floyd fithian dind received permission from the house rules consnittee to offer a superfund amendment to hr  the fithian amendment would change the financial contribution ratio for municipal dumpsite cleanup the superfund now requires a responsible municipality state to contribute  percent of the money to clean up a site representative fithian wants to change it to only a  percent contribution from the municipality state this amendment would put additional financial strains on the limited resources of the fund and therefore cma is opposed to the fithian amendment uncertainty remains as to how the senate will deal with the comprehensive amendments to rcra contained in hr  on may  the senate committee on environment and public works reported s  which does little more than re authorize and provide twoyear funding for rcra because of the house activity senator chafee held an additional day of hearings on june  to receive testimony on many of the issues in the house bill cma testimony was presented by mr bill moore rohm and haas company on june  senators hart and moynihan introduced s  which would re quire epa to list within  months hazardous waste which could no longer be disposed of in landfills it is reported that senator hart will offer this as as amendment to s  in sumnary after an extremely fast start the process to amend rcra has slowed but not stopped it appears likely that some changes will be made to rcra but it is unclear what form a final bill will take cma continues to bring its concerns to the attention of the appropriate members of congress testimony on safe drinking water act the senate environment and public works subcommittee on toxic substances and environmental oversight gorton rwash held a fourth and final hearing july  on sdwa reauthorization these hearings are important because they will focus on who has the authority federal state or local government to manage ground water resources and the recharge areas mr fred steinberg of ppg industries testified for cma at these hearings in support of some minor reforms to the swda and in opposition to federal management of ground water resources cma  environment safety and health  epa oversight by four house subcommittees on july  and  four subcommittees chaired by congressmen moffett dconn scheuer dny gore dtenn and waxman dcal held joint hearings on epa oversight though ostensibly a review of the first  months of anne gorsuchs administration at epa it was called a political sideshow and a witch hunt by several republican members including congressmen larry winn rkans bob members ably defended mrs gorsuch their willingness to characterize the hearings for what they were  a media circus  had a positive effect on the type and content of the media coverage no new issues were raised as the same litany previously aired in the media was heard again budget cuts personnel changes and morale groundwater strategy liquids in landfills rcra and superfund implemented tsca enforcement efforts lead in gasolinethriftway secret meetings research and development and the like the following conclusions may be drawn first and foremost anne gorsuch more than held her own she ably withstood the political attacks and responded with good points of her own the media coverage was not unfavorable to her one tv report called it a trial not a hearing film clips showed her cool calm and collected throughout and quoted one democrat congressman calling the hearing a waste of time second the chemical industry was not made a target of the hearings cma was mentioned only once or twice for example in connection with our pmn exemptions petition third we believe the hearings failed to achieve the democrats purposes although not permitted to present live testimony olas efforts to work with minority members of the subcoemiittee and with epa paid off cma submitted a statement for the record of the hearing safety and health  cma testifies at senate hearing on tsca oversight on august  senator slade gortons rwash subcommittee on toxic substances and environmental oversight cononittee on environment and public works held a hearing on tsca oversight hamilton hurst vice president of nalco chemicil company testified on behalf of cma socma epas dr todhunter nrdc and the conservation foundation also testified the hearing focused on  negotiated voluntary testing under section   the pmn process in general and cmas exemptions petition for low risk chemicals under section h  epas section a reporting rule and  international harmonization effortsoecdmpd the entire tone of the senate hearing was constructive and not adversarial unlike recent house mediaoriented events reviewing epas first  months under anne gorsuch cma achieved its goals of providing a balanced review of epas accomplishments in implementing tsca and educating the subcommittee as to chemical industry concerns regarding reasonable interpretations of tsca chairman gorton learned of the real progress being made by the agency and of the advantage to the public and epa as well as to the industry that will result from negotiated testing agreements and pmn exemptions barring unforeseen development the subconmiittee sees no need to consider amendments to tsca at this time and  will return to tsca next year  i cma  safety and health  pmn test data congressman james florio dnj has requested the office of technology assessment ota to conduct a review and analysis of the adequacy of the toxicological test data contained in the premanufacture notifications pmns submitted under section  of tsca security procedures have been established to protect confidential businessinformation the study is expected to be completed this fall and depending on its results mr florio will undoubtedly hold hearings either later in the fall if congress is in session or in the spring of next year in connection with tsca reauthorization depending on the outcome of the study mr florio can be expected to push for some type of fixed set of pmn testing for all new chemicals along the lines of the european system oecdminimum premarket data cma is handling this issue with great care we have written to epa expressing our concerns about the handling of confidential business information and about the scope of the review safety and health  animal research testing congressman doug walgrens dpa science subcommittee held hearings last fall and this spring on a bill to promote nonanimal testing and impose limitations on toxicological research stringent limitations would be placed on research laboratories including rigorous accreditation procedures inspection of facilities review by community representatives and veterinarians and recordkeeping on august  hr  was reported by the full science committee of the house so long as the administration continues to oppose it passage by the senate is not considered likely cma is monitoring developments safety and health  comparative risk analysis a house science subcommittee held markup on congressman don ritters rpa risk analysis bill hr  the measure would establish a  month research and demonstration program to improve comparative risk analysis techniques in regulatory decision making and to coordinate risk evaluation efforts among nine federal regulatory agencies the bill was reported out of the full science committee and passed by the house august  the cma regulatory impact special committee supports the concepts of the legislation safety and health  genetic screening the office of technology assessment ota the scientific arm of the congress is studying the extent to which companies are using genetic and cytogenetic screening in the workplace the study was requested by congressman albert gore dtenn whose house science subcommittee on investigations and oversight had previouslyheld hearings last fall and in june of this year although preliminary results of the study show only a handful of the fortune  companies are presently doing any biochemical or cytogenetic testing mr gore seems predisposed toward the position that many companies are rushing headlong into using such screening as an employment tool that would discriminate against certain classes of employees or applicants for employment the ota study is expected to be completed this fall and mr gore undoubtedly will have more to say on the subject a cma member company testified at the previous hearing and we are monitoring developments cma  energy cma testifies in favor of natural gas deregulation on july   cma testified before the fossil and synthetic fuels subcommittee of the house energy and coimnerce committee the cma energy committee chairman james d beatty manager energy  engineering government relations of the procter and gamble company presented the cma viewpoint urging that a phased deregulation of all natural gas begin by a date certain the testimony addressed the serious shortcomings of the natural gas policy act of  citing examples and focussed on supply problems and inequities caused by differing volumns of prengpa gas in the various pipelines the cma testimony came as part of a users panel during the second in a set of seven house hearings examining issues regarding natural gas decontrol the previous hearing was also devoted to receiving the comments of consumers of natural gas and two studies regarding the potential impact of deregulation were released gas distributors and pipeline companies more recently presented testimony in early august further hearings will soon be announced and the federal energy regulation coimnission ferc is expected to testify after labor day cma coalition efforts continue and communication materials are being prepared there are no indications that proposals for natural gas deregulation will progress beyond the hearing stage in this session of congress energy energy taxes andor fees j rather than prepare a separate revenue raising measure the house ways and means coimnittec voted to go directly to conference on the senatepassed tax bill the bill prepared by the senate finance committee in july does not include the imposition of an oil import fee or any type of energy tax however a ways and means committee staff memorandum does include a listing of energy taxes and fees as possible items to raise revenue the scope of conference activity was limited to the provisions of the bill and existing law therefore consideration of a tax or fee on energy were not addressed cma efforts continue in opposition to any additional energy taxes or fees including imposition of a broadbased ad valorem btu tax or oil import fee our advocacy has emphasized the chemical industry dependence on natural gas as feedstock and that federal spending cuts and passage of accelerated natural gas decontrol within the existing tax structure would be more desirable ways to reduce the budget deficit energy i j  emergency preparedness on august  the president signed legislation setting a minimum fill rate for the strategic petroleum reserve spr and extending until december   the antitrust exemption for oil companies participating in the international energy agreement iea public law  requires the filling of the spr presently  million barrels of crude oil at a rate of at least  barrels per day with an ultimate goal of  million barrels the legislation also calls for the president to prepare a plan for withdrawal from the reserve the plan will not be subject to congressional veto and will be triggered in the event of a severe petroleum shortfall cma   cma continues to closely monitor emergency preparedness issues because of the possibility of legislation and adoption in various states of price and allocation plans for dealing with am oil shortage energy reorganization of the department of energy a bill has been introduced in the senate that would merge most of the department of energy functions into the department of commerce a high priority for legislative activity is being sought by the administration but little senate support has been evident in the house no comparable bill has been introduced and some congressional critics have indicated that the administration has not provided the leadership necessary to move the bill forward there is very little likelihood of legislation in this session of congress trade petrochemical discussions the international petrochemical business is in distress this has resulted in unprecedented discussions between governments about solutions to present and expected market difficulties the eec and the us government have had three meetings which focussed on the eec claim that us oil and gas price controls were an unfair subsidy to us petrochemical producers these talks are dormant but dumping charges hav been filed against a number of us products the japanese have similarly claimed injury to the japanese domestic and export markets by us exports of petrochemicals the first govemmenttogovemment talks have been held and more are to follow the japanese are considering  filing dumping charges against us products the us and mexican governments have agreed to petrochemical discussions in the belief that there are difficulties ahead between the two countries the conversion of mexicos oil and gas reserves into exportable quantities of petro chemicals is expected before the end of this decade advisors to these discussions have been selected by the government from candidates proposed by ola they have participated in the talks with the eec and will similarly participate in the japanese and mexican talks trade competitive assessment studies two studies are being made in the government on the future competitive position of the us petrochemical industry the united states international trade commission report investigates the impact on the us industry of expanding petrochemical industries in oil producing nations in the department of commerce a special cma  i office has been created by secretary baldrige for competitive assessment studies of us industries the us petrochemical industry report will be the first effort cha is cooperating with government departments in these studies trade reciprocity legislation senator danforths bill s  the reciprocal trade and investment act of  was reported out of the senate finance trade subcommittee hay  the house counterpart is hr  introduced by representative frenzel provisions include extension of   of the trade law to cover services intellectual pro perty rights foreign direct investment and negotiating authority for hightechnology goods as of august  s  has  cosponsors and several endorsements from business and agricultural groupjs it is expected to go to the floor soon after congress returns from its august  recess concern exists over addition of protectionist domestic content amendments which according to danforth would kill the bill the domestic content bill in the house is hr  and it has  cosponsors the international trade committee at the direction of the executive committee sent its endorsement of s  excluding amendments to the senate finance committee on july  trade export trading company legislation i export trading company legislation has been passed by both houses and is now subject to joint conference the vehicle is s  with amendments  include language from representative st germains hr  if passed into law a new form of joint export effort will be possible the cha international trade committee will determine how to advise member companies on use of the export trading company form of marketing transportation maritime reform proposals delayed j the maritime reform bill reported out by the senate commerce science and transportation committee is still awaiting floor action due to opposition by senators howard metzenbaum doh and strom thurmond rsc the delay has been created because of antitrust implication and because of senator slade gortons rwa opposition to an unrelated bill involving the illinois brick case s  is supported by cma and reflects consensus reached between representatives for shippers and carriers house floor action on the merchant marine and fisheries committeereported proposal hr  has been delayed until the resolution of antitrust concerns by the house judiciary committee jurisdiction over the bill was asserted by the judiciary committee and markup was completed in late july with support from the  administration  negotiations between the two committees continue and the questi cma  now is which version will emerge from the house rules committee cma generally supports the judiciary version and would encourage no further amendments except for language clarification if a unified version is presented to the house rules committee it is possible the bill could go to the floor under suspension or without the opportunity for change passage of a house bill similar to the senate measure would offer the senate leadership the means to adopt the house bill thus foregoing conference cma efforts continue as part of the shippers coordinating committee on maritime reform transportation canadian diversion legislation that would restrict the movement of us made products through canadian ports was unexpectedly sent to the house rules committee last month hr  had been labeled noneontroversial in an attempt to gain the opportunity for house floor consideration  a rule for the bill was not given opposition to the bill came primarily from a group of midwestern congressmen and from cma efforts continue to heep the bill from reaching the house floor regulatory reform legislation the long delay in house consideration of regulatory reform legislation may be nearing an end earlier this year the house judiciary committee favorably reported an omnibus regulatory reform bill hr  danielsondca since that time a new subcommittee chairman congressman sam b hall jr otx has been named for the subcommittee that developed the legislation a on march  the senate passed s  the regulatory reform act s  is an amended version of legislation introduced by senator paul laxalt rnev and is strongly supported by the business comnunity cma was a part of the business coalition seeking passage of this important legislation in july the business coalition stepped up its efforts to secure house consideration of hr  before the august recess speaker thomas p tip oneill and other members of the house democratic leadership had reservations about the legislative veto and judicial review provisions of the bill their problems however may be resolved by amendments which would bring hr  closer to the language of s  although chances for house floor consideration of hr  in august are small regulatory reform legislation may yet be enacted in the present congress cma  i t patents patent term restoration bill reported cma has actively supported passage of patent tern restoration legislation hr  and its predecessor bill hr  kastenmeierdwlsc on july  the house judiciary committee favorably reported hr  to the house y hr  would add up to  years of patent life to products that must undergo governmentmandated testing and review during the markup of the bill by the judiciary committee a technical amendment was approved which would designate the beneficiary of patent term restoration as the product sponsor rather than recipient of marketing approval this change would ensure that the toxic substances control act would be entitled to the benefits of patent term restoration r patent term restoration legislation passed the senate by voice vote last year although hr  has some  cosponsors in the house it is currently opposed by a coalition of organized labor certain consumer groups and the generic drug industry the business coalition supporting early passage of hr  including cma and naca is following the leadership of the pharmaceutical manufacturing association pma which supports early house passage of hr  without further amendment it is anticipated that hr  may be brought up on the house floor under suspension of the rules thus requiring that at least twothirds of the members present vote for the bill representatives of cma member companies have been alerted to contact members of congress urging them to vote for passage of patents employee inventor legislation i congressman robert kastenmeier dwisc has introduced two bills that would govern the patent rights of employed inventors hr  and hr   would prohibit preinvention assignment agreements between employers and employees which transfer to the employer rights to any invention that is not an employment  invention or a service invention hr  also calls for adequate compensation for the inventors service invention on july  the house judiciary subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice held a public hearing to receive support testimony from the institute of electrical and electronic engineers and from the aflcio additional hearings may be scheduled in the future the patent and trademark committee is

associated industries of massachusetts have been engaged in discussions with the administration legislators and environmental groups much of the year the bill in its current form is bond financed and contains no additional liability language michigan hb  has passed the house and is in the senate pending further action although the bill still requires further amendments to more closely link it to federal superfund it is financed from general revenues and does not contain liability provisions the new jersey spill fund will likely be the subject of significant amendments this fall by

director of communications richard l wilson introduction the cma communications department has one primary objective to increase recognition that the chemical industry is committed to act responsibly to protect the public from the health and safety risks of its products  and thereby to develop public support for the industrys public policy positions the depart ment is an integral part of the cma umbrella function of advocacy cmas communications activities are instrumental in shaping public understanding and public support from this understanding and support evolves government controls and issuerelated laws and regulations the department is interlocked with and suppor tive of every other cma department and committee through every step of the public policy process the cma communications committee made up of the top pro fessionals in the industry monitors department activities and helps in program development the comprehensive program includes advertising  the cma twoyear old advertising program produced measurable results as tested by cambridge reports in its third wave public opinion poll earlier this year almost half the political active sample surveyed were aware of the cma communi cation in the magazines in which the ads appeared those aware of the communications gave the industry better marks  percentage points for its efforts on waste disposal than those who were not for the first time since  the proportion of politically active individuals who feel the industry is concerned about the average persons welfare  nearly equals those viewing the industry as unconcerned the current creative strategy  to demonstrate the chemical industry commitment through the personal concern of individual industry people by showing their dual role as concerned parent and worker  will be used for the remainder of this calendar year these ten humaninterest advertisements appear in time newsweek us news  world report smithsonian the new york times the los angeles times

participated in a debate on health and safety issues affecting the chemical industry during the past year the committee met its goals on ma jor regulatory proposals educated the occupational safety and health adminatration osha in health and safety regulatory reform publicised responsible workplace practices employed throughout our industry participated in voluntary standard setting organisations and worked with congressional staff on issues of concern to the legislature some major accomplish ments of particular note include e convincing osha that its labeling objectives could be met through effective hasard communications programs already in use the current regulation is a signifi cant savings over the  billion estimated to be the cost for chemical industry compliance with a labeling rule proposed by the last osha administration e selling osha on use of balancedperformance stand ards the committee drafted a model standard on hasardous materials demonstrating these principles the committee also sponsored a seminar for a large group of agency standard writers on how to prepare performance standards e participating actively in the revision of the agencys carcinogen policy through written and oral presenta tions to osha its advocacy of sound proposals on health and safety matters won the committee professional respect and rapport among osha policymakers this relationship has been built on solid and timely responses to the agencys questions and requests by maintaining the agencys respect and confidence oshc has been able to provide insight and important industry perspective to the osha adminatration as it develops regula tory proposals while occupational health issues receive much of the hype and attention devoted to workplace practices safety issu s represent a substantial component of oshas regulatory pr gram during the past year the oshc advocacy program on workplace safety was expanded to balance its health issues

aeeoaplish the objec tives and fulfill the needs of our industry in having reason able controls on workplace practices cma cma  remarks to cma board of directors chairman occupational safety and health committee january   during the years  and  and  under the leadership of tom evans the osh committee of cma was reorganized reenergized and became recognized by government agencies as a force for industry representation and cooperative effort with this as a foundation we decided to look at the tasks for the year  he decided that initially we should reevaluate the current osha administrations attitude establish cooperative nonduplicative efforts with other interindustry groups establish strong communica tions with other cma committees whose work overlapped and influenced ours and consolidate andor eliminate task groups where feasible the attitude of the current osha administration was succinctly made clear to us by a communication which we received from mark cowan the thendeputy assistant secretary for osha he said after years of stating that industry if given the opportunity is well equipped to address workplace problems industry now in the osha area has an opportunity which may never again be repeated the opportunity exists for corporate america to double and redouble their efforts in this field so as to prove it can be done without undue government interference the chance to demonstrate conclusively that companies sincerely care about their workforce is available should this opportunity be missed or worse should corporations through a deemphasis of safety and health programs give credence to the allegation that the only concern in the boardroom is profit the old osha of days past will rise from the grave with a vengeance now is not the time for corporations to let down their guard nor to relax measures which have resulted in gains in the safety and health area he believe that this gives us a clear indication that the current osha administration will continue in the vein that they have been and that they are open for cooperative efforts from industry groups he are redoubling our efforts to establish closer and more efficient coopera tion with a number of industry groups since numbers of our health and safety people serve on task forces with diverse organizations were attempting to determine who should have the lead role in responding to individual osha regulations in an effort to minimize the time travel and effort required of the members of your company on these various committees the organization deemed most appropriate to prepare the primary response does so the other organizations then adapt the response to their needs he are in the process of eliminating some task groups and consolidating others and will reduce the number of task groups from  to  or  in an effort to stream line the work of the osh comittee and again reduce the time and travel required by task group members however major efforts will continue in the area of carcinogens reproductive hazards respirators targeting health inspections industrial noise performance standards and hazards connunications federal and and state and consunity cma   we have been involved with a number of activities with the government agencies involved with health and safety matters a major theme which runs throughout our responses and testimony related to all osha standards and regulations is the theme performance standards we are constantly advising osha to write their standards with the goals and objectives desired the general processes andor strategy including work practices to reach the goal and to minimize the specifications in the materials and equipment a major effort has been carried out by the safety standards group in this area they have written a model standard for hazardous substances in the workplace in performance language at the request of the assistant secretary for osha they have used this document in a training session for standards writers in an effort to educate them in the writing of performance standards this has been well received by osha and the task group has received a letter of thanks from the director of osha for their activity it is our hope that with this training effort and interaction with osha the new standards will be written in true performance language another significant work effort with osha has led to the adoption of the safety inspection targeting system for routine safety inspections this enables osha to focus their inspections on highhazard industries where theyll do the most good and enables those of us with good safety records to be free of routine safety inspections work is ongoing to apply a similar methodology for health inspections and recently two of our members attended an osha workshop where an effort was being made to devise such a method the method recommended by the cma members appears to have been favorably received by other members of industry the unions and the governmental agencies we shall continue with efforts in this area over the near future another major effort was carried out on the standard for hazards communica tion this culminated in testimony by a fourmember panel of cma on june   ur work in this area was completed when posthearing comments were filed in september  as stated previously were hopeful that a federal standard in this area will reempt a myriad of state standards which currently exist from being enforced and also prevent the writing of standards by states and communities which have not yet done so we presented the argument that osha has the authority to preempt states standards with a federal standard on the basis that a myriad of state standards will present an undue burden on interstate commerce this brings me to the area of states activities task group which is doing yeoman work to track and respond to an increasing number of state and local initia tives dealing with hazardous substances under worker right to know and community right to know statutes it is not clear whether the promulgation of a federal hazardous communication standard will supersede the current states statutes but the minimum we hope to achieve is to reduce the proliferation of further state and community statutes in this area it is worthy of note that the state of california has already announced their position that there is no federal override so long as the state statute is as stringent as the federal further although the federal statute may affect worker right to know laws from proliferating we are unsure as to what effect it will have on community right to know standards considerable work remains to be done in this area in conjunction with the legislative affairs committee cma  the issue of managing reproductive risk in the workplace deserves some comment the reproductive risk issue continues to be active with legislators and in the news media as you are probably aware a recent court decision in the olin caseupheld the concept that prohibiting a fertile female from working in an evnironment which is harmful to the fetus does not constitute discrimination on the basis of sex but is a legitimate work practice cma has had a lead position on this issue for some time and the osh committee will be conducting a conference on managing reproductive risk in the workplace on may  and   it will focus on a review of the most recent information in this field with emphasis on how various companies are addressing it attendees will be restricted to cma members from various line and staff disciplines in the latter half of  conferences will be conducted on worker educatiorf and on process safety analysis in addressing the future the committee determined that it needed a better mechanism for picking and choosing from the myriad of issues which ones it should most appropriately address in an effort to do this we determined that we would look at the issues presented to us from the viewpoint of the likelihood of their occurrence and their potential impact on cma member companies issu s will be submitted to the osh committee by the redesigned future issues task group members of the committee and the general membership of cma in conclusion the osh committee recognizes that the problem of worker community and product liability which is currently being addressed by the executive committee will be a very significant issue for federal and state legislators for some time to come and will be intertwined with hazardous substances communication worker right to know and community right to know regulations cma cma  exhibit b chemical regulations advisory committee executive summary th chemical regulations advisory committee crac has developed policies on governmental control of chemicals at the point of manufacture primarily by guiding spas implementation of the toxic substances control act tsca tsca is compre hensive and significantly affects not only our industry but also parts of society dependent on chemical products the acts pervasive impact therefore makes effective implementa tion a key to managing the regulatory burden on the production of chemical products since tsca was enacted in   crac has guided epas implementation of the act mainly bv comment ing on or proposing major rules the environmental protection agency epa implemented very little of the act before  however because of the industrys persistent interaction with epa many reasonable procrams are now in place or have been proposed for example several final rules on existing chemicals are considerably less burdensome then they might have been without cracs ef forts negotiated voluntary tasting is a reality the premanu facture notification pmn program is functioning well with many pmns filed on cmas pmn form and spa has proposed a pmn exemption program for certain chemicals  largely in response to a cma petition future cma concerns should focus on how the remaining sections of tsca are implemented for example the chemical industry needs to work closely with epa to ensure that the agencys followup programs on new and existing chemicals are implemented soundly the next  months will be a momentous period for crac me have received many signals that tsca reauthorisation and oversight activities will be particularly challenging ready public interest groups such as the natural resources defense council have announced they will push to amend tsca so that it will require base set testing of chemieals it is paramount that cma be aware of and effectively deal with both national and international attempts to modify the act if the chemical industry plans to survive these uncertain economic times and flourish in the future tsca must be implemented and administered fairly and reasonably we must he prepared to meet any challenge that would create additional and unneces sarily burdensome requirements to prepare for those critical activities crac initiated a survey to assess what the industry has done and is doing to reduce unreasonable risks to health and the environment crac plans to use the survey information in the reauthorixation and cma   oversight hearings and la aupportinc cma positions on rea sonable control of chaaicala the information should also b valuable in supporting othsr cma advoaacy programs on environmental issues crac is committed to representing cmas interests to spa as it implements the remaining sections of tca and to work with the agency now and la the future as it administers the law furthermore crac is prepared to dewote its attention and resources beyond tsca as neoessary to moot the boards purpose cma cma  remarks to cma board of directors by e hamilton hurst chairman chemical regulations advisory committee january   it seems like only a few months ago i had the pleasure of addressing this group to outline the activities of your chemical regulation advisory committee crac in the interim we have had a busy but a very productive year i am pleased to be here once again to highlight for you what has taken place and to outline our plans for the coming year in your premeeting books you will find a detailed summary of our activities this has been prepared by the cma staff which has been of great assistance to us throughout the year z will not cover all of the items included in this summary as i want to spend my time here discussing the major events and our future activities there are a few key events that did take place over the last  months which deserve a quick highlight when we talked last the epa had frankly imple mented only a portion of what tsca will ultimately be there was much crit icism of the agencys failure to implement tsca the events of  have changed that and a great portion of the proposed rules have been finalized and put into place reporting requirements of tsca production use and exposure data were required on  chemicals by november  health and safety studies were required on  chemicals by december  testing for  the court mandated a schedule for epa to respond with a decision to test or not to test  xtcdesignated chemicals the efa has made those decisions in  cases with  others imminent in addition to the court ordered schedule epa has made decisions on  other itcdesignated chemicals chemical control rules for regulating pcbs in electrical equipment and excluding cma  some closed or controlled waste manufacturing systems were finalized a third pcb regulation scheduled now for december  will address all other processes which generate incidental new chemicals some  new chemicals have gone through the pmn process with only a handful being regulated the spa reports that approxi mately  of the pmns are of such low risk that they can complete this review in about  days only  warrant extensive review exceeding  days time less than  have resulted in either spa orders or were withdrawn by the submitter because of questions on risks associated with the chemical the agency has responded to cmas petition to exempt certain smallvolume chem icals sitelimited intermediates and polymers from full pmn review based on results of their pmn review experiences epa proposed exemption rules in august  which should finalize by midyear  since the events i have outlined are epa actions and regulations at that you might reasonably ask  well what has crac done to earn our pay  the epa seems to have done all the work  and what we have gotten are regulations i can proudly say  we have done a lot cma has had major impact in each of these areasto our industrys benefit in the reporting area for production use and exposure data reporting the original epa proposals covered  chemicals  about  times what was covered in the final rule cma was successful in convincing epa they should ask only for the amount of data they could reasonably handle and digest on a current basis we were able to avoid data gathering for data gatherings sake the health and safety data in the finalization of these rules we were successful in reducing the amount of data to be submitted we were able to shorten the historical time period for which each company must review their records and submit data testing in the testing area production use and test data information cma  input from the individual companies has resulted in a number of decisions by the epa to not require testing of itcdesignated chemicals in other instances companies have been able to use negotiations to reach agreement with the agency on what testing is most reasonably required crac has promoted the acceptance of the negotiated testing concept as a practical substitute for formal test rules under tsca negotiated test agreements save our resources and result in testing programs which focus only on the most significant needs new chemicals the experience epa has now achieved from processing  pmns has allowed us to isolate facts from this data to demonstrate and convince the epa that exemptions to the pmn system were needed justified and would help both industry and the agency while the agency would always like to have more information and test data submitted on the pmn they have developed review procedures using pmn information and structural similarity studies with which they are satisfied they can carry out their responsibilities for pmn review under tsca it was very refreshing to hear an epa spokesman at a recent presentation of their pmn system remark  we recog nize that the pmn can be a terrible burden on new product innova tion there is no way we should expect the development of complete test data on each new chemical at this stage of their development nor do we need it to make the assessments required by tsca  here again the epa has heard us weve come a long way baby at least with tsca the epa is getting practical while we have our successes we still have some major obstacles in front of us an important priorities for  oversight hearings  scheduled for early  final pmn rules  scheduled by the second quarter final pmn exemption rules  scheduled by the third quarter the development of epas approach to assign priority to and to regulate existing chemicals these forthcoming events dictate our immediate plans for the future and it will require our close attention to solidify our present gains and to continue the implementation of tsca as a workable law the most significant of our future activities is also the one we have to tackle cma  first  the oversight hearings while i had a rather uneventful experi ence of testifying before a senate subcommitte on toxic substances and environmental oversight back in august of  the real game will be played early this spring perhaps in february or march in both the house and the senate we expect the oversight hearings to be particularly tough as our opponents seek to turn around some of the successes we have achieved specifically in the house before congressman florios subcommittee we expect to see the following issues to be pushed by the environmentalists tsca should be amended to require testing of new chemicals since industry is providing test data in less than  of the cases the agency should not be allowed to accept negotiated testing agreements as a substitute for test rules since these agreements are unenforceable the ability of the agency to regulate chemicals under tsca is constrained by the need to balance risks and benefits and make findings of unreasonable risk this requires that tsca be amended to reduce these constraints the environmentalists have indicated they intend to open tsca for amend ments and we believe congressman plorio will be willing to listen congress man florio has already commissioned ota office of technology assessment us congress to make a study on the adequacy of data submitted on a pmj in addition he commissioned the gao general accounting office to study epas pmn review process to include procedural and policy differences between epas and eecs approach the senate has commissioned gao general accounting office to study the merits of negotiated testing versus testing rules so our work is cut out for us within crac we have established an ad hoc oversight committee chaired by myself with carl umland of exxon as vicechairman this consul ttee made up of our task group chairman and coordi nated with the government relations committee through our key man jerry kinney of onion carbide is preparing position papers on these issues and others we plan to enlist the help of our friends on the house sub committee to counter the environmental leanings of congressman florio and others on the committee we will welcome any and all help we can get as we enter this oversight activity our objective is to avoid damaging amendments to tsca while we expect our major confrontation with the environmentalists will be in the house the climate in the senate is also not the most desirable though the senate subcommittee is controlled by republicans the specific members have environmental interests and we will again need to be well prepared as part of our preparation for oversight and for use in other public arenas we are completing our survey on chemical company activity to reduce unrea sonable risk this survey which your executive committee approved at our fall meeting in chicago should provide valuable information for use at the hearings to demonstrate that industry on its own has taken the action needed to reduce unreasonable risks and that the spirit of tsca is working furthermore the data should help us indicate that significant changes to the law are unnecessary we have over  companies participating in the survey so we believe the results will be creditable initial results appear to be following the pattern seen in the pilot survey which we completed early in  the companies have sent in their responses and our contractor is tabulating the information for us now we expect to have an initial tabulation of the results by january th for our review of course we will forward a copy of the results of this survey to you prior to announcing it to the public we expect we will be ready for public release around february st getting back to the regulatory side of our operations the agency has announced they intend to publish final pmn rules by april  and are preparing an active followup program for certain new chemicals we have reason to believe the agency has again heard us and will back off from the extensive pmn forms originally proposed while we have urged the agency not to adopt a form we expect they will require one to encourage consis tency and organization of the pmn data we will be endeavoring to again provide impact in the development of the final form we expect to followup activity will be based upon the implementation of significant new use rules snurs and the various reporting rules for chemicals in commercial production we could see some of these followup programs early this year we expect these will be used in only a handful of cases but we are actively working to assure the criteria used to initiate this activities are acceptable the pmn exemption proposal put forth by the epa follows for the most part the concepts offered by cma in its petition where the agency has proposed more extensive and burdensome approaches we have reacted through comments testimony and facetofaee discussion to offer alternatives which will achieve the epas and industrys goals we expect final rules on exemptions by midyear and our new chemial task group now chaired by jerry hapka of dupont will be working to bring these to fruition cma  the last major regulatory objective under tsca will be the establishment of proper criteria to select and give priority to those chemicals which may become the subject of regulation this is a part of tsca under which the agency is still under criticism since there have been no final rules regulating chemicals under tsca other than pcss which was written into the act itself the agency is working to develop a process for existing chemicals now zn the past year we established under crac a new task group chaired by fred hoerger of dow to work with the spa on this process develop ment there are  or  chemicals that spa is now reviewing and we could expect one or more of these to be the subject of proposed rules by the end of  or early  controlling some aspects of production processing distribution use or disposal he believe we are in a position to make this process a reasonable one as it is developed in summary  saw major advances in the implementation of tsca and major progress on the part of the epa in making the final rules and procedures much more reasonable crac through its  active members and the excellent cma staff support we have received has been instrumental in achieving this we said last year that a window existed with this administration to make significant advances in implementing tsca in a reasonstie way we have gotten number of rules through that window  will present new challenges the most critical of which will be our oversight hearings where we must hold our ground and solidify the gains we have made we still believe tsca is a workable law when implemented in a reasonable and timely fashion we will need to demonstrate that it is working and that the goals of tsca to reduce unreasonable risk are being achieved we will not seek to reopen tsca for asiendment however should this occur we are prepared to offer our suggested improvements i have had the pleasure of chairing the crac comittee for the past year and a half and will complete this assignment and my fourth year of crac membership in june i thank you for the support you have given to your committee and to me personally the work of crac was needed crac has been and continues to be effective in achieving industrys goals to make tsca a workable law as it is implemented cma cma  exhibit c executive summary in  cma through the patent and trademark committee patc has been an instrumental voice in providing industry input to the us government m the development of its patent policies at home and abroad the patc has also advocated cma positions as appropriate directly with foreign authorities during the past year cma through the patc has obtained increased visibility and respect in the industrial property rights area congressional and agency staff persons solicit cmas comments on pending domestic legis lation anticipated regulatory changes and international negotiations committee members in addition to preparing written comments for submission by cma have for example testified before the patent and trademark office on a proposed rulemaking and have served as industry advisors to the diplomatic conferences held this year in geneva switzerland on proposed revisions to the international treaty on industrial property rights commonly known as the paris convention in all these forums the committee has stressed the importance of strengthened patent protection to technological advancement and economic recovery and perhaps as significant in this time of economic difficulties the patent and trademark committee has fulfilled its  activities with almost no expenditures for outside assistance either technical or legal with one minor exception all written comments were prepared and advocacy activities carried out by committee members other designated cma member company representatives and cma staff we also do not anticipate any major outside assistance expenses curing  finally the patc believes that an important part of its role lies in communication with all cma member companies both through the cma board of directors and through other member company representatives on develop ments in the industrial property rights area we therefore work to increase awareness of the importance of these issues among member companies and in return to obtain an understanding of member company positions on these issues armed with this information the committee is able to formulate proposed cma positions for board approval in this communications role in  the patc has informed the board of a number of patent issues including paris convention developments has held an open committee meeting and has communicated with member companies through such mechanisms as action advisories and newsletters this executive summary has been excerpted from page two of the following report the section entitled patent and trademark committee activities and accomplishments overview  i cma cma  remarks to cma board of directors by roy h massengill chairman patent and trademark committee january   the year  has marked three major milestones in the reform and improvement of the patent system better to meet the needs of fostering techno logical progress procedures are now in place to obtain a higher quality patent before issuance to obtain less costly determinations of patent validity without expensive litigation and to obtain more certain application of the patent laws in litigation progress has been more difficult in changing the substantive law to restore a full patent term for products whose introduction has been subject to regulatory delay unfavorable changes in domestic federal law to regulate contracts with employed inventors have been averted so far attempts by developing countries to force early consulsory licensing or can cellation of patents have also been put off so far the year  will bring renewed discussion on all three of these substantive matters patent term restoration employed inventors contracts and compulsory licensing of patents in third world countries it will also bring we hope renewed discussion of two changes in the substantive us patent law regarding inter national trade and renewed discussion about interference practice inventorship in the corporate setting and other matters your cma patent and trademark committee will work to help formulate and enunciate cma policy on these issues and to communicate with cma member companies on developments in these areas i patent reform a examination many cospanies can expect patent costs to go up next year because of the us patent and trademark office pto fee increases effective october   that represent the first fee increase in almost  years in combination with new management at the us patent and trademark office the hiring of more examiners better examiner training better main tenance of the search files and an overdue trial of automated searching these fees will we hope bring a steady improvement in the system under which patents are granted and trademarks are registered in the us we expect several procedural changes to be discussed next year that will enable the additional resources to be used to shorten the period it takes to issue a patent or register a trademark while reducing the proportion that are issued improperly because of such curable errors as prior art references missing from the patent examiners search file b alternative to litigation the reexamination system now in place is designed to provide a quick and lowcost administrative procedure to have an issued patent reviewed by the pto for patentability against printed prior art raising a new question of validity while the courts seem in general willing to defer to the patent office on such issues the use of reexamination has been less than had been predicted by its proponents perhaps more time is needed for patent owners and others to use this system more regularly as an alternative to litigation in any event recent legislation has opened up issues of patent validity and infringement as proper subjects for arbitration  cma   by next year we should begin to know whether or not this new alternative to expensive patent litigation will be used widely arbitration may be the preferred route for deciding if sensitive commercial activity invalidates a patent on either prior use or best mode grounds or avoids infringement for technical reasons which neither party wishes to be made public reexamination will remain the nonlitigation alternative for dealing with printed prior art c litigation improvement a major change in  has been the creation of the court of appeals for the federal circuit which has appellate jurisdiction over all cases arising under the patent laws as well as over appeals from the patent and trademark office by developing a uniform body of interpretations it is hoped that this court will eliminate forum shopping in patent litigation because the court was formed by the merger of  one court with experience in appeals from the patent and trademark office and from the international trade commission and  another court with experience in claims against the government this new appeals court can be expected to show a high level of understanding of the technical and commercial significance of patents ii legislation carried over a patent term restoration the biggest disappointment this year has been the failure to enact legislation extending the term of patents whose effective term has been eroded by years of regulatory delay as dick waterman reported to you last year the cma patent and trademark committee had a principal role in drafting this legislative proposal following the lead of the pharmaceutical manufacturers association we hope to push this bill into law during the next congress the press of other business and opposition by key senators and congressmen prevented this bill from being enacted in spite of majority support in both houses b employed inventors agreements two attempts were made last year to regulate by federal law the contractual relationship between employed  inventors and their enployers we expect these efforts to intensify next year particularly in the area of defining fields in which the employees inventions are assigned to his employer and other fields in which the employer has no investment the topic of statutory compensation to employees when their inventions are used commercially will also be raised these issues will be monitored closelyand reconmiendations for cma positions will be made if congress seems likely to act on either proposal iii international   developments the major developments on the international front have been recent attempts by developing countries to revise the paris convention the basic international treaty regarding patent filing to permit a country to order cancellation or compulsory licensing of a patent not locally worked within a few years while the us government has been supportive of industry in opposing these proposals we have had to work with our counterparts in europe to encourage their governments to take a similar stand cma  i i x a   a changes in the us substantive law regarding extraterritorial application of us patents there are two provisions of us patent law which differ from the laws of most other countries in a way that places a us manufacturer at a competitive disadvantage in international trade when his sole patent protection relates to improved processes for making known products as is often the case in the chemical industry he cannot use the courts to challenge those practicing the process abroad and importing the product his remedy before the international trade commission has many other conditions unrelated to patent issues that he would not have to meet in a normal civil action an analogous provision of us law provides no effective remedy for the holder of a patent on a machine having several components against another party who manufactures the consonants in the us for assembly abroad we will be reviewing proposed legislation next year to remedy both of these problems b changes in interference practice we will also be reviewing proposals to reform the interference practice used by the us patent and trademark office to determine priority among inventors claiming the same invention in order to expedite these determinations a symptom of problems in this area is that a patent is now issuing on crystalline polypropylene that could be enforceable until the end of the century c other issues other areas that we plan to review are the treatment of related inventions by different combinations of inventors in the orporate setting uniform policies for ownership of patents data and software resulting from governmentfunded research and the possible implementation of the examination chapter of the patent cooperation treaty conclusion the current political climate represents an unprecedented opportunity to reform the entire patent system in the us to make patents reliable assets for investors in technology the increased costs and delays asso ciated with bringing innovative products and processes to market make the need for enforceable patents and affordable enforcement procedures more urgent we hope that  brings continued improvements in these areas domestically together with renewed efforts to prevent an erosion of the patent system in the international context cma cma  exhibit d summary of international trade committee report to cma board january   with chemical exports deerseeing and isports increasing in a world swinging toward nor protectionism

petrochemicalrelated discussions between the us government and those of europe japan and mexico representing the committee as well as their individual companies mem bers assisted to the degree possible with six separate government agency studies concerning petrochemical competitiveness and reviewed an american enterprise institute proposal for an overview study of us trade policy to

will increase significantly in the aoatha and years ahead cma cma  remarks to cma board by robert e chairman international january  of directors lory trade committee  this morning ill be reporting to you on the work of cmas international trade committee in  the second year of its formal existence its obvious to all of us that in recent years chemical industry sales and earnings have depended upon large volumes of exports three measurements currently however are on an unfortunate downtrend in  the dollar value of us chemical exports was  billion in  the value slipped to billion for two consecutive years the trade surplus in chemicals  the excess of exports over imports  has decreased the   and  dollar values were respectively  billion  billion and  billion over the same twoyear span the share of industry sales going to the export trade has declined from  percent to  percent the two sides of our current trade reality are clear chemical exports are decreasing while at the same time imports are on the rise theres another trade reality that the us chemical industry has to reckon with as well and that is the swing toward protectionism we are seeing all around the globe  including the us this industry is confident of its ability to compete in world trade  to the extent that we are not blocked from doing so by governmental barriers whether the government be our own or that of a foreign country while the words of the international trade cosnittees charter may say it more color fully a shorttext version of our mission is to work to remove existing barriers and to derail attempts to create new ones with this mission as our focus this morning ill be covering what i see as the committees major accomplishments during the year and the major issues before us in  first a word on organization in  two task groups were refocused and a new task group created  bringing our task group number to five we broadened the mission of the north american trade policy task croup to include all import matters affecting cma member companies the task groups name was changed to import policy task croup we expanded the membership of our multinational corporations task group and changed its name to the intergovernmental organizations task group to better reflect its proper focus early in cma  the year we formed an investment policy task group to more adequately cover this policy area and to provide support to dexter baker who is now chairman of the investment policy advisory committee set up by the trade representatives office since i plan to cover  accomplishments by task group area of concern the investment group is a good place to start shortly after its formation the group focused on the subject of bilateral investment treaties through its work we were able to give the associations view on a model treaty to united states trade representative ustr ambassador brock investment treaties specific to egypt and panama were also discussed with ustr this group also prepared and distributed to member companies a survey on foreign investment to provide the committee with member input on specific problem areas that should be addressed fiftythree companies responded and the data provided is now being analyzed by the task group i turning to the intergovernmental task group a main concern of its members last year was the socalled vredeling proposal in the european coonunity as leo johnstone reported to you in october the thencurrent draft of the proposal called for advance consultation with workers on a variety of management decisions  including investments in other parts of the world the association supported the joint national foreign trade couneilus council position on the issue and the heavily amended version that was approved by the european parliament was clearly a defeat for its backers and was viewed as resulting from effective lobbying by us multinationals a major reason behind the formation of this task group was the variety of activities concerning international companies going on in various agencies of the united nations during  these activities were priori tized from the us chemical industry perspective and a number of meetings with un officials took place  including one with us ambassador kirkpatrick while developing countries often seem to be the loudest voices in the un they are also loud in their demands for special treatment by individual industrialized countries  notably the united states and particularly with respect to our treatment of the products they wish us to import the general system of preferences gsp is an important us recognition of this demand the system offers dutyfree entry of a wide variety of commodity and finished goods gsp became effective january   and will expire on january   the ustr administers gsp and it and the congress are expected to be holding hearings this year on its renewal preparatory to our active involvement with this issue the import policy task group prepared and distributed to selected cma members a questionnaire designed to gather data on member awareness of and concern about gsp our position is now in the early development stage i i  cma  the us tariff schedule in general is getting cma attention due to the program to harmonize our schedule with the customs corporation council nomenclature which is used by most of the worlds other industrialized nations late in  the international trade commission released chapters  and  of the new code these deal with commodity inorganic and organic chemicals respectively chapters  dealing with enduse chemical products are expected to be released in february the entire project is scheduled to be concluded by july   with imple mentation of the new harmonized code set for mid while unable to take positions on individual products cma recognizes its potential importance to members as some products will see significant tariff increases or decreases because of this we sponsored  with socma and spi  a trade seminar on the subject that was attended by  industry representatives we will continue to supply timely information and procedural guidance to member companies on a matter specific to this hemisphere the import policy task group reviewed the administrations caribbean basin initiative which was a threepronged program of trade tax incentives and supplemental aid to the caribbean basin countries to assist their economic progress cma did not take a position on this subject in that the bill currently drafted does not offer significant chemical investment potential either as an opportunity or threat for us producers however we continue to monitor the bills progress another piece of legislation on which we took no specific position was the export trading company act which is now law this legislation may however be helpful to smaller companies and through the cma news we informed members who might be interested in the subject about commerce department and us chamber seminars dealing with it during  a host of protectionist cries were raised in washington many of which prominently featured a new buzzword reciprocity our export policy task group was active in an industry coalition supporting senator danforths bill s  which provides for extending section  of the trade law to cover services intellectual property rights and foreign direct investment in july cma endorsement of the danforth bill  without amendments  was sent to the senate finance committee no real action took place on this bill in  but ill consent further on its outlook when i cover  issues a position specific to the protection of intellectual property rights was developed and forwarded to commerce secretary baldrige the export task group also prepared a position dealing with antiboycott regulations this however has not been issued externally as yet as we are awaiting action by the business roundtable and the us chamber who have the leads on this issue cma  our fifth task group has bean dealing with one specific policy issue  that of the export of socalled hazardous substances the rescinding of president carters overly restrictive executive order was a direct result of chemical industry efforts and a number of cma suggestions have been incorporated in the present acceptable form of the proposed new order now in the white house our objective all along has been to keep this as a simple notification scheme  without any form of government control and not tied to specific shipments so far weve succeeded to put the industry stake here in perspective the wrong outcome on this one would immediately put into jeopardy some half billion dollars worth of pesticides exports in addition to issues worked mostly within our task groups the committee has been active in a number of other areas a primary area of activity has centered on petrochemical discussions between the us and other governments while discussions with the connon market were dormant during  cma provided two groups of advisors to assist the os trade representative and the department of commerce respectively in preparing for and carrying out talks with japan and mexico us efforts in the japanese talks were directed toward giving them a better understanding of what they considered to be our unnatural advantage in natural gas pricing mexican focus while not yet clarified is expected to be on the export of their products into the us leo johnstone has led the cmafielded groups of industry advisors with excellent results to date with respect to the mexican talks the committee formulated a set of proposed us objectives and passed these to commerce one thing these discussion activities highlight is that us industry with all its problems is far from being alone in searching for solutions last month delegations from cma and cefic met  at the europeans request  to discuss common views with respect to a number of inter national trade matters a familiar response to a perceived problem is to initiate a study during  six separate studies regarding various aspects of petrochemical competitiveness were progressed by various us agencies these include the commerce department the international trade commission two studies the ustr the world bankimf and the office of technology assessment the committee and member companies assisted to the degree possible with each in connection with one of the international trade commission studies  on investment performance requirements  the committee prepared a statement for the record on the shortcomings of the questionnaire designed to provide its data base the use of these various studies bureaucratic study often is not a precursor to but more times than not a substitute for meaningful action cma  if these governmentinitiated studies were not enough last year the committee reported to you that we were working to develop a study of the chemical industrys international trade problems this was dropped as a chemical industry project but an ad hoc group of industry members have interested the american enterprise institute in conducting a wider study of us trade policy cma has reviewed and taken no exception to the initial effort to scope the study the association will not be participating as a financial supporterwith governmental and media interest in trade at seemingly an alltime high the committee felt it worthwhile to develop for its own use a set of general communication guidelines which put current and future trade policy matters in perspective on a related topic the development of positions is effective only insofar as they are communicated in addition to the specific targeting of position papers ive mentioned earlier late last year the committee put together a compendium of its positions and background papers this was distributed at our october open meeting and subsequently mailed to each member company trade contact additionally throughout the year trade contacts were provided with information on a wide variety of trade related topics whats ahead for us this year the short answer is more of the same governmenttogovernment petrochemical discussions still will be with us mexico is currently anticipated to be the most important in  but japan talks could be reinstituted at any time canada also at any time could initiate a request for discussions while in recent months european talks have been dormant these too could awaken with respect to the export of hazardous substances issue  should the presidential executive order be as we expect acceptable to industry this subject will still demand close cma scrutiny in its subsequent legislative and regulatory phases we also will be closely monitoring developments as ostr and congress formulate their policies regarding renewal of the generalised system of preferences we can expect protectionist voices to continue calling for reciprocity legislation with other groups cma will continue to push for s  without amendments this isnt going to be easy and i cant say the outlook is very favorable we will continue to work closely with ustr and others as appropriate on bilateral investment treaties and other investment related issues  cma  the un moves slowly but given its role as a forum for developing countries and given these countries attitudes about multinationals and their role in the new economic order and a host of views that boil down to an it is more blessed to receive than give posture selective monitoring of un activities is clearly warranted and well no doubt have some surprises from legislators and regulators  both here and abroad  as they seek to further their individual causes at chemical industry cost for its work in  the committee has the resources it needs it has an active and knowledgeable membership its task groups have excellent participation and management committee and task groups benefit from excellent cma staff support  and from the active and effective partici pation of industry leaders such as leo johnstone and dexter baker who with conmittee members and cma staff have maintained close ties with key government people he have excellent rapport and high credibility in this general area of trade where industry objectives are similar to those of the administration in closing i would however ask each of you to consider the active participation of your trade experts in our committee task groups if you perhaps have no one in your organization who you would judge to be such an expert i submit that you seriously consider developing that expertise i further submit that membership on one of our task groups is a costeffective way to obtain it i firmly believe you need this expertise in past years trade as such may not have been all that glamorous a subject but if one measures glamor by the amount of news media attention a subject gets that past truth is truth no longer glamor aside im hopeful that my presentation this morning has helped underscore the subjects importance to this industry today  and more important tomorrow cma executive summary in  the major tax problems faced by the chemical industry were presented in the context of legislation to reduce growing federal budget deficits in significant part by increasing taxes on business tax measures which are considered in this political context are judged primarily on their ability to raise federal revenues rather than on merit or reason during this past year cma and its member companies were successful largely by limiting legislativetax losses rather than by obtaining new tax benefits although these achievements were made in the context of legislation which substantially reduced the income tax benefits of investing in chemical plant and equipment they were nonetheless important these achievements include o o o o rejection of proposed alternative minimum tax maintenance of foreign tax credit and deferral of tax on current foreign income of foreign subsidiaries maintenance of domestic international sales corporations disc provisions with current benefits reduced by  percent maintenance of accelerated cost recovery system acrs with reduction of  percent of acrs benefits when full  percent investment tax credit is taken on acrs property with federal budget deficits for fiscal  and fiscal  now projected to exceed  and  billion respectively we anticipate that the adminis tration and the congress will again seek in the th congress to reduce th s deficits through tax increase legislation the problems encountered in  by cma and the chemical industry are likely to be repeated in  in this environment the tax policy contittee will direct its efforts in  to the following major tax goals and objectives o o o o o o o o o monitor tax and funding aspects of public compensation legislation and consult with other cma committees on appropriate action maintain tax incentives for us exports which are at least equivalent to disc maintain present treatment of foreign tax credit and deferral of current income of foreign subsidiaries maintain and improve accelerated cost recovery system acrs and investanent tax credit resist any increase or expansion of minimum tax on corporations improve and extend tax credit for research and development extend statutory moratorium on treasury regulations   which require allocation of research and development expenses to foreign income provide chemical industry connnents on treasury regulations when issued interpreting cercla taxes on chemicals and petroleum provide chemical industry cosnents on treasury regulations when issued on  erta and  tefra legislation cma cma  remarks to cma board of directors ay glenn w whits chairman tax policy committee january    was not a good year for the chemical industry in terms of us tax policy changes in us tax law adopted as the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of  tefra now place the chemical industry in a position worse than when this administration took office it is important to note that the tefra changes were not as adverse proportionately for other industries such as basic metal production or oil refining how bad were the  changes in  the superfund legislation was adopted many observers in the chemical industry viewed that event as one of the worst that has ever befallen this industry superfund calls for the collection of about  billion over a year period this is an aftertax amount of about  million per year of which the chemical industry is paying  percent or  million per year in fact actual collections are somewhat less because of low industry operating levels the  percent reduction in investment tax credit costs the chemical industry over  million annually more than twice as much as superfund remember the reduction in investment tax credit was only one part of the adverse changes in tefra ironically much of the adverse impact from tefra may not be felt by the industry in  because of the poor overall condition of the us economy on the positive side several adverse proposals did not become law the proposed alternative minimum tax was not adopted there was no legislation making significant adverse changes in the us taxation of foreign source income the acceleration of depreciation from  to  years that had become law in  was preserved although the future improvement in the rate of depreciation that was to have become effective in  and  was lost with an impact in those years of more than  billion in cash for the industry having set the stage with these comments on the state of tax affairs let me assure you that the tax policy committee is alive and well and doingits best in light of the help we get from our friends in government the committees membership presently stands at  committee meetings are generally attended by moreindividuals than that number all of the members are active and each one brings a valuable perspective and insight to the conmittae cma  we have three operating task groups capital formation foreign taxation and value added taxation we are in the process of establishing a new task group in the area of state and local taxation this latter area has become of more concern with the concept of new federalism and the concommitant need for more funds by the states in the task groups we make an effort to include persons other them committee members this gives an opportunity for a larger group to participate in industry tax affairs it also provides the committee with an opportunity to obtain the special talents of experts and an opportunity to see prospective future committee members in action the role of the tax policy committee is to keep you advised of all relevant developments in the tax area to do this we carefully watch proposed legis lation the promulgation of new regulations prospective treaties and new litigation where any of these facets of developing tax law alert us to changes that affect the industry we will advise you on the implications of such developments where appropriate we will suggest policies the industry may wish to follow in developing new industry positions we work towards a consensus view after all a position cannot be that of the industry unless substantially all of the members find it at least acceptable that means the debate is occasion ally crisp nonetheless we generally can reach quick accord because we recognize the other side is the government and it wants our money tax legislative policy probably presents a different problem than any other issue the industry faces tax legislation is an everpresent issue that is not resolved by a legislative enactment instead the federal tax law is under ongoing review by the senate finance committee and house ways and means committee and the various staff organizations as well as the individual members staffs there has been some sort of serious tax legislative thrust posed in each congressional session since  significant laws were enacted in         and  because of the ongoing nature of these enactments and because of the peculiarly complicated and highly technical nature of this legislation it is necessary to provide continuous review and contact particularly with the staff persons in congress and treasury who are responsible for developing new legislation member companies carry out this activity on an individual basis both through their technical tax staffs and government relations offices the continuity in the tax policy connittee as presently constituted better enables us to follow and adopt sound positions in the everchanging matrix of technical proposals cma  cmas staff representative for the tax policy committee came to us from the house ways and means committee and as a consequence can and does assist the committee in being aware of what is happening in the staff arena sk ne ipatw t f ry i the committee continues to use the law firm of miller and chevalier as outside counsel messers sherfy and heyde from that firm provide valuable assistance in drafting position papers for the committee after the positions are establish ed they and other members of the firm provide valuable insights on a variety of tax issues as new situations develop during  we foresee development of a number of serious tax issues with a budget deficit in excess of  billion it is almost certain an effort will be made to raise taxes including the corporate income tax several areas are likely to be affected probably there will be a second bite at the investment tax credit apple if recapture of the whole credit is taken out of basis the credit would be reduced to about  percent with an additional cost to the chemical industry of  million there is a sentiment to tax employee benefits such as medical and other insurance premiums and perhaps some forms of deferred compensation not presently taxed there seems to be a renewed interest in taxing the overseas operations of us corporations fter a new tax thrust is posed by the socalled public compensation legislation the tax watch on this legislation is critical in my view this could be a legislative catastrophe for the industry is jd ss it is likely there will be changes during  in the way us exports will be taxed it is clear that the members of the gatt council are convinced that the existing domestic international sales corporation disc is in breach of the subsidies code our deputy trade representative has agreed the adminis tration will prepare legislation in this area although treasury has rec ommended that the disc be repealed and that no tax substitute be established in its place there is good sentiment for a continuation of tax support for us exports the tax policy committee will press strongly for a tax system that provides export assistance at least equivalent to the disc  here i pause for my only coranercial we of dow hope youll support an effort to revise the system so the presently accrued disc earnings will not be taxed in the future believe me it is more important to most of you than it is to me end of commercial  we await regulations interpreting the tax law in several important areas mo regulations have been issued for the windfall profits tax or for superfund regulations are due any day now on the foreign tax credit of course ive been told that consistently for more than nine months i guess youd call that an inhuman gestation period almost no regulations have been issued in connection with the  erta and  tefra legislation cma  we stand prepared to comment on all of these regulations as they come forth in proposed form this past year we undertook a new activity for the committee we filed an amici brief in support of a member companys attempt to get to the us supreme court this issue involves the availability to the internal revenue service of the corporate analysis of its tax reserve account that account establishes the potential liability of the taxpayer on issues in the tax return about which there is some question cma is supporting the taxpayers effort to get a review of this matter by the supreme court we propose to continue to provide support to you in all of these tax areas we are willing to undertake any other efforts you the board the executive committee or members request we do have a favor to ask in return if we accepting or rejecting it so we can take an freeze us by inaction remember we want to in the strongest and best way we can find find a new position more acceptable to you propose a policy help us by effective position please dont represent the chemical industry if a position is rejected we can i have had the pleasure of working with many excellent tax committees and tax organizations the cma tax policy committee is outstanding it has been my pleasure to be its chairman cma cma  executive summary exhibit f cmas communications program reflects ths shift in direction to an issueoriented balanced industry communi cations program this advocacy campaign draws on the com bined resources and perspectives of the associations government relations technical and communications departments providing a stronger force with which the association can communicate with legislators other associations and industries and the general public cmas focused costeffective communications program is aimed at developing an equitable environment in which to develop public policy the communications committee its task groups and the cma staff are the backbone of this communications program together these groups create elements that include news relations and general public relations activities mews media activities are designed to voice industry and association policy and programs to the press these reflect the departments close relationship with government relations and the associations shift to targeted efforts this program element grows in importance as our relationship with the press consistently needs nurturing both from a national and local community level the media tour program reached more than cities by the first of january including  television  radio and  newspaper interviews with cma staff and science advisory group members clearly this kind of activity enhances cma and industry relationships with the press and gives us one more positive step toward achieving balanced reporting another approach to broadening press relationships is the placement of cma officers and executives on major speaking platforms such as the detroit economic club the world affairs council of pittsburgh and the executive club of chicago the first of these featured cma chairman simeral speaking on the policy agenda for the chemical industry in  focusing on the economy international trade and environmental regulation twenty reporters from national and trade publications partici pated this kind of activity creates a positive profile for the industry the news media section will be instrumental in helping to develop major communications efforts over the course of the year focusing on specific critical issues such as hazardous waste disposal and public compensation these efforts will include many aspects of the ongoing cma communications program ie special press kits to be used at the local level radio broadcast and telsvision programming issues advertising and speaker engagements an example of this kind of specialized issue effort is the clean water program currently in effect and targeted for four congressional districts this effort includes media tours which began in december in areas of west virginia new york state and kentucky these will be followed by radio broadcasts and issues advertising when the clean water act reauthorization is introduced in congress this communications strategy is successful in reaching the cma  representatives of these districts it will be used with other issues alsawhara cha broadcast network continuas to axpand it includes the report a series of threeminute newsfeatures distributed biweekly to a  station network spontaneous newsfeeds with actuality sent to anywhere from  to  stations second television newsfeatures and expanded activity at the american women in radio and television awrt and the national farm broadcasters association nafb conventions a prime example of the good that comes from such efforts is the press and broadcast activity surrounding the livingston loui siana trainderailment in september chemtrec cmas chemical transportation emergency center was notified of the incident within minutes of the derailment the director of chemtrec participated in  telephone interviews these efforts were supported by the chemtrec newsfmature which was flown to seven local stations and the cable news network reaching an audience of more than  million people producing balanced reporting while diffusing negative reactions toward the chemical industry although the national print advertising has been termi nated some localized issues advertising on specific topics is being prepared for use in targeted areas currently a clean water ad to be signed by a national coalition is being developed to support the clean water efforts in congressional districts in west virginia and new york state the cma advertising task group has allotted  to the special clean water work group for this effort other issues advertising is being developed on an as needed basis in support of other program activities in the last  years cmas catalyst awards program has honored  college junior college and high school teachers with national awards some of these winners have displayed outstanding speaking talents and will be considered for pos sible speaking engagements to further cmas contact with various educational and consumer groups this is an inexpen sive way of tapping a greatly underused resource production of four public service announcements psas are targeted for completion in the spring these psas will be in keeping with the new issuefocus and will be

number of pages and a reader survey of each is also being considered cheaecology special reports continue to be included in special news media packages for the press cma is supporting a pilot regional communications pro gram in louisiana with the louisiana chemical association this program reflects the associations focus on state and local issues the national purpose of this pilot program is to develop a model plan that other states and areas can use as well as to create a more positive public identity for the chemical industry in louisiana limited to one state the program is molded to that states communications needs and will be carried out by the state chemical industry council or its equivalent along with the support of companies that make up the council cma is providing  for the pilot and will offer guidance to lca and its public relati ns director the program is being put into place this month and will be evaluated after one year the cma communications program was funded until now by a separate chemcap assessment which stood at  percent of member company dues with the dollars saved by the eli mination of the national print advertising program added to existing carryover funds cma was able to reduce the  assessment to  percent beginning in fiscal year  the special assessment will be wrapped into overall dues the assessmentwrapin reflects the industrys commitment to an industry communications program that is wellbalanced costeffective and a necessary support to all association activities cma cma  remarks to cma board of directors by william m metten jr chairman communications committee january   the communications committee appreciates this opportunity to bring you uptodate on our industrys communications pro grams priorities and problems in the next few minutes i would like to outline a new direction in the focus of our communications program share with you several examples of how cma communications activities support our industrys goals and lastly touch on the future communications challenges facing our industry but first a brief overview of how the public perceives the chemical industry may be of interest the negative perception that the public has of our industry has not changed the public believes that the industry is irresponsible in its management of wastes and is unwilling to deal with critical environmental issues unless forced by federal and state legislation the publics perception of us as bad guys is influenced and reinforced by a news media which is steadily chipping away at the private enterprise fabric of our societyby docudramas that protray business and businessmen as dishonest and motivated by money aloneby the outcries of environmentalists and selfstyled protectors of the public interest its no wonder is it that opinion survey after opinion survey shows such a negative public attitude toward our industry with the hazardous waste issue the foremost issue preoccupying the publics perception and like it or not perception equals reality in the publics mind our cause is not aided either by the fact that the admini stration because of economic and other political considerations has not been able to provide the leadership necessary to influence legislative activities to deal with the problems of our industry within the past six months cmas communications program has undergone a significant change in direction three factors are primarily responsible for bringing about this change one will certainly come as no surprise to anyone in this room  the economy has not been kind to our industry in this adverse economic climate the communications committee recognized the need to reduce communications expenditure a decision consistent with actions taken by many member companies as you know a substantial reduction in cma communications expenditures occurred in the print advertising area as a result of eliminating the national print advertising program the  chemcap assessment has been reduced from  percent to  percent the second factor contributing to a change in the direction of our communications program is a closer liaison with cmas government r lations committee cma  a strong relationship between government relations and communications is essential when you consider the necessity for our industrys communications to be focused around and in support of the legislative issues facing our industry a stronger bridge has been built between the communications and government relations committees for crossfertilization of ideas and planning communications strategies and building constituencies this is a relatively recent marriage at this point both partners are enthusiastic about the opportunities for coordinating cma communications more closely with government relations objectives we look forward to the day when this approach bears fruit the third element of the new direction in our industrys communications activities is a desire to try new and different approaches in our ongoing commitment to reshape the publics negative perception of our industry we recognize that we are locked into a constant and shifting battle for the publics under standing and support results are difficult to come by victories are few but we must vote present on the issues and use every means at our disposal to communicate the industrys accomplishments and commitment on industry issues we have initiated two activities which illustrate the use of innovative communications approaches to accomplish these objectives one involves a pilot regional communications program in cooperation with the louisiana chemical association this program will be tailored to that states communications priorities and the leadership is being provided by louisiana chemical association and its member companies funds are being madti available from our communications budget for one year the louisi ana experiment begins this month we hope that the experience gained will be useful in developing model communications programs for use in other states to develop public policy support at the grass roots level  another innovative approach involves a grass roots communica tions program in support of clean water this is the first time that we have targeted a single message within key congressional districts to build a coalition of supporters and activate a public relations campaign at the grass roots level here again this is a learning experience and we are hopeful that it will produce results which can be applied elsewhere personally speaking i am excited about these new approaches and the new direction that our communications program is taking i know that our communications committee shares this feeling the members of our committee  your employees  have contributed greatly to shape and guide these new communications activities now i would like to touch on the other communications activities which continue to play an important role in cmas overall communications program cma  i am referring to such activities as cmas media tours which are planned around a specific issue and targeted for maximum impact in geographical areas and congressional districts media tours consistently delivered results and we are increasing the tours in  broadcast communications is another resultsoriented communications activity cma now broadcasts a regular series of threeminute radio features dedicated to major issues of the association and distributed biweekly to  stations e the balanced television newsfeed continues to be a key ingredient in our news activities for example we fed a recent feature on superfund via satellite to more than  stations e consumer information programming  this activity con tinues to generate results and good will for our industry and maintains mutually beneficial relations between cma and consum r public interest educational and other influential groups th objective here is also to advocate our position on major issues as well as provide a forum for member companies to talk about their individual product benefits at conventions like the american women in radio and televi sion industry experts are interviewed on a variety of subjects in the aftermath of the train derailment at livingston louisiana cmas chemtrec staff and news service department turned some adverse circumstances into a positive media experience in the time remaining i would like to take a prospective look at the major issues confronting our industry and suggest some ways that our communications committee is considering addressing the issues in support of our industrys position the biggest single issue which adversely affects the publics perception of our industry is hazardous waste disposal notwith standing efforts by our member companies and an ongoing program by cma itself the public perceives that they are at great risk from chemical wastes the hazardous waste issue has such a grip on the national consciousness that this single issue affects the publics perception on other industry issues such as clean air and clean water later on today i will have the opportunity to ad dress the public perception of hazardous waste issues as part of a waste management plan presentation to be considered by the executive committee in closing i would like to acknowledge the contribution of individuals on our committee and thank you for contributing their advice and counsel on the tough communications problems our incustry is facing their efforts continue to make a real contri bution to our program i also wish to acknowledge the efforts of cmas communications staff whose enthusiasm and commitment on behalf of our industry is a key element in the progress we have made in recent months cma cma  exhibit g biomedical and environmental special programs advisory committee charter purpose the biomedical and environmental special programs advisory committee spac will ensure that all programs are conducted in a manner consistent with cma policy

by dr e h blair tha dow chemical company the international affairs group lag was formed by approval of the cma board and of the soola board in november  a record of the activities of iag can be found in the minutes of the steering committee meetings and a copy of the charter exists in the cma office copies are available to those who wish to have one iag is concerned with the international consequences of efforts by national governments groups of governments andor international organi zations to manage the identification and control of chemical risks to human health and the environment the us chemical industry trade associations and their member companies have actively supported a constructive domestic policy on the identifi cation and control of chemical risks to health and the environment such matters may cross national borders as does the flow of chemical substances and chemical industry investment there is growing inter national initiative in the health safety and environmental arena thus it is necessary that the us chemical industry via iag develop and support a constructive international policy to meet the need for increased international understanding of and commitment to these objectives during the past three years iag has held numerous meetings with the european council of chemical manufacturers federations cefic com prises many national chemical industry trade associations including those for countries within the european community this past year members of iag traveled to japan to conduct discussions on matters of testing and control of chemical substances with the japanese chemical industry association jcia and through jcia the ministries of international trade and industry miti and health and welfare and labor in addition to the multiplicity of laws affecting the trade of chemicals between various nations is the everincreasing activity of supranational bodies these include the european economic community eec the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd chemicals programme the united nations environmental program unep and a host of technical and scientific programs that fall under various united nations and other global governmental programs cma  possibly the most important evidence of iags activity is in the oecd arena at the recent high level meeting ii the united states succeeded in its two year attempt to avoid imposition of testing requirements for new chemicals in the form of oecds minimum premarketing data set mpd these requirements would have been placed on new chemicals prior to manufacture in the us for domestic use under an agreement worked out november  spearheaded by epa administrator anne gorsuch oecd delegations endorsed a us proposal that would allow individual oecd nations to select their own approaches for reviewing new chemicals this success is due to a large part to iags activities working closely with those of oecds business and industry advisory committee biac while in fact providing much of the muscle and advocacy behind bxacs positions to ensure that us industries were not shorted in the international arena in effect our success at these recent oecd meetings means that the us industrys requirements for premanufacture notifications on new chemical sub stances will remain unchanged for the present tsca will not have to be amended in this respect because of international pressures and commitments other agreements which the us delegation obtained were good laboratory practices to provide a reliable basis for mutual acceptance of testing data protection for confidential business information agreement to consolidate and evaluate continue to expand oecd work on chemicals data interpretation guides for initial hazard assess ment of chemicals rather than we are now at the beginning of a  year experience in which the japanese requirements will coexist with tsca section  law with the european community baseset systems in its ten member states and with the oecd mpd system as it is or will be implemented in other oecd countries such as australia and possibly canada i ag will have a major role in participating in this comparative experience in the interest of international trade and against the increasing demands for protectionism if any changes in tsca section  are seen to have merit on review of the next  years global experience with new chemicals iag should have a critical role in that evaluation similarly assessing the risk of existing chemicals will require monitoring of the various national programs to minimize duplication to assure that trade disincentives are not created and to speed understanding of new information testing procedures etc how much of this iag should or can do remains to be determined cma  international compliance programs where iag can provide guidance are those of labeling waste disposal occupational health and possibly transportation again the extent and depth of lags involvement in these activities in terms of participation with other domestic and international chemical industry groups needs to be determined other lags activity in the confidentiality of identity issue in the european inventory of existing commercial chemicals einecs taught us the importance of increasing direct contacts as early as possible with the individual national chemical industry trade associations while at the same time coordinating with the regional groups especially cefic this lesson can be used in the continuing aspects of this issue now directed at the pmn systems and probably also in the several different labeling systems which need to be made compatible and ultimately harmonized these conflicting systems are now developing in different countries differences are evident in the methods by which chemicals are classified by their delayed effect hazards such as cancer the same is true for the language used on labels to warn about these hazards for example there is the potential of warning about a cancer hazard in europe but not in the united states the implications of this difference for product liability are substantive iag has formed a work group to develop a route to an international consensus on this question this group will coordinate with the aihc and cmas osh committee as well as counterpart organizations in the industry during the coming months and years iag must continue to formulate and implement programs to deal with international chemical controls we will need to identify and analyze national and international health and environmental issues of concern to the us chemical industry as rising expectations and concerns develop worldwide on chemical contaminations w will need to develop positions responsive to these concerns develop strategy and action plans and use and coordinate appropriate industry resources in managing these issues we must do more to establish and maintain national and international relations necessary for effective dissemina tion and exchange of information to do so means working with other trade associations in the us and in foreign lands working with the appropriate agencies and representatives of the us and foreign governments wherever appropriate and with international organizations such as unep oecd etc in our activities we continue to examine new channels for the flow of information in order to identify issues and to develop positions on these issues as in the past we will develop numerous position papers where needed reports and documents and bring them to the attention of foreign chemical industry trade associations and where necessary to continue our direct trade association personal contacts cma  in conclusion there is much for iag to do in the next  years the critical question remains how to balance iag resources and capabilities with the needs as they develop i and my associates will continue to keep you informed on these matters and to seek help and guidance when needed if you have any questions time i would be pleased to accept them at this thank you for your continued interest and support cma cma  exhibit i treasurers report seven months ending december   this

industrys position on public compensation our industry is committed to protecting the public from the health and safety risks of chemicals and waste disposal sites several government and private organizations have studied the impact of chemicals and waste disposal sites on public health but none has established on a scientific basis that there is a broad health problem therefore the chemical industry strongly supports and encourages continued data collection and analysis to determine the extent of any possible health effects in this area such data collection is already mandated by existing statute until the nature and scope of this issue is better understood it would be unwise to create a broad new public health compensation system in the meantime current compensation systems such as social security workers compensation the courts and private insurance should be adequate to protect individuals who may have a legitimate basis for seeking relief the chemical industry is prepared to cooperate in the collection analysis and interpretation of information needed to establish a sound understanding of the health risks associated with waste sites j  would your industry support the asbestos coalition proposal the chemical industry will not support the chemical supplement to the asbestos proposal since data does not exist that indicates any major health effects from chemicals it would be totally erroneous to group chemicals with their very different characteristics and effects together with asbestos chemical manufacturers association board of directors m etmg cma  exhibit m member services department status report to the board of directors january   member services is two years old this month since the report of a year ago state chemical groups activ ities have accelerated at that time there were eighteen organizations with which we worked today there are  in  states the iberville chemical industry council was formed in louisiana it like the councils in river parishes and lake charles serves in an autonomous satellite capacity to the louisiana chemical association a chemical industry committee under the wing of the associated industries of kentucky was organized in november we now have relationships with two local councils in ohio  cincinnati and cleveland the ohio chemical council is working with them as independent satellites and hopes to aid in the formation of other similar local groups an effort was made by companies to establish a group in south carolina while well supported by a large majority of concerned firms the matter is now on hold there was definite opposition from a few companies who felt interests were being served by the state chamber of commerce and the south carolina textile manufacturers association marketing considerations also were involved in the decision we are in a handholding stage with an illdefined fledgling group in wisconsin which did send a representative to the second annual meeting of state organizations in chicago last october states with viable organizations excluding south carolina and wisconsin include alabama california connecticut delaware louisiana kentucky michigan illinois missouri new jersey new york ohio pennsylvania tennessee texas virginia and west virginia nearly every group either has greatly expanded its scope of operations or is well along in planned expansions notable examples are california illinois missouri and ohio all groups however are concerned with the need to increase cma  membership and institute a dues structure which will make possible carrying out projects in support of their programs they are making ever greater use of cmagenerated mater ials and are calling on me and others in the cma departments for assistance similarly they are now drawing progressively more on each other  exchanging information and copying successful projects without any feeling of damaged proprietary interests there has grown a sense of unity between state groups and with cma the relationships are good and they no longer feel challenged or harbor the fear that cma is attempting to take them over the latter point however always must be borne in mind there have been a few instances when cma committee members or staff have been perceived as dictating to a group these have been due to misunderstandings at times on both sides and rather quickly corrected during the past year  have met on invitation with the boards of the ohio and california councils committees of those in ohio and louisiana attended and spoke at the annual meetings of councils in louisiana new jersey texas and ohio i also worked on site in organizational or restructuring meetings in california south carolina and kentucky cma has assisted or will assist in membership drives in new jersey california kentucky ohio alabama illinois and missouri usually a letter is sent to cma member companies in a targeted state urging participation it is signed by president roland further he and vice president geraldine cox are sought after as speakers and as representatives to meet local reporters in all media branches t obviously a great deal of contact is maintained by letter and telephone plus visits to cma by state group leaders the local leadership newsletter is one of our prime means of contact copies of the last two issues will be distributed at the board meeting one summarizes the second annual meeting of state organizations the other analyzes on page one the critiques of attendees at the meeting it also provides in sight into the input we receive from the groups and the cross fertilization taking place since the first issue january february  circulation has grown to  from approximately  as state groups and cma member companies have requested additional copies originally it was thought four issues a year would suffice the amount of information forced us to produce six we now are faced with the possibility of issuing  and probably  a year to report all the activities on a more timely basis cma  despite economic conditions attendance at the second annual meeting of state organizations was down less than nine percent those attending were most enthusiastic and look forward to the third annual to be held in conjunction with cmas semiannual meeting in new york this coming november they were pleased that lou fernandez spoke at the dinner meeting just as they were that bill simeral did so the first year your attention is called to the critiques of the meeting in the newsletter in september corky caldwell reported to you on general ized plans for a cma membership drive it was decided then to delay implementation until the economic climate improved meanwhile progress is being made on the development of mater ials to be used we are not depending on ideas generated solely within cma but also are studying campaign materials used by other organizations hopefully  will show enough economic improvement to launch a drive shortly research will begin for the production of our third analysis of  states considered to be of prime interest to the chemical industry this is a statistical study which ranks each state as to the chemical industrys e e e e shipments in dollars value added number of employees percent of employees to all manufacturing employees percent of employees to state population number of cma member

of government relations william m stover taxation tax and budget developments following the november midterm congressional elections president reagan sought to regain legislative momentum in washington by returning to the area of tax and budget issues where he had won substantial victories during his first  months in office in an effort to restore public enthusiasm for his economic program the president proposed to accelerate the scheduled third year individual tax rate cut from july to january of  however strong early warnings from republican leaders on capitol hill convinced him that he did not have the votes to support such a step congressional concern over rising unemployment and federal deficit figures cast serious doubt on whether any tax program could be passed in the postelection special session the president also moved to demonstrate his concern over unemployment and the administrations willingness to develop an effective jobs program sensing that the highway program was the only available legislative vehicle that could be passed in the postelection session the president threw the full weight of his office behind the transportation departments proposal to extend the highway trust fund and to increase the federal excise tax on gasoline by  cents a gallon  these revenues intended to complete and re build the nations bridges and highways on december  the house passed the administrations proposal with relatively few changes and senate approval was expected to follow but not without a fight taxation disc under review behind the scenes the administration was confronting another major issue of tax and trade policy in early september the us trade ambassadors office represented before the gatt council in geneva that the administration would introduce legislation to meet the objections to the domestic inter national sales corporation disc provisions of the internal revenue coda voiced by european and canadian members it was reported that in the meeting of the administrations cabinet council just before thanksgiving there were strong differences over the proper scope of any legislation to amend or to replace the disc provisions trade ambassador brock and commerce secretary baldridge strongly supported maintaining us tax incentives for trade similar to disc equally strong in their opposition to disc and any continued tax support for american exports were treasury secretary regan and budget director stockman in view of this disagreement the cabinet council deferred taking final action on this issue cma  throughout tha fall business representatives in washington have moved to develop a united position on disc in general there is a strong consensus for continued tax incentives for us exports at least equal to disc since there is currently no legislation which has administration support the business community has maintained unity through adherence to common principles to be included in amendatory legislation cma has been active in the effort of business and allied trade representa tives to maintain an effective tax program for exports our tax policy committee has reviewed and rearticulated our position on disc so that our spokesmen can continue to participate in the dialogue on this crucial issue energy congressional quick fix sought on natural gas prices a series of bills have been introduced during the postelection session that would essentially freeze the wellhead prices of natural gas and extend price controls legislation proposed in both houses would also provide assistance to the elderly and those on fixed or low income who are adversely impacted by increased natural gas prices some legislative proposals further abrogated existing contracts by calling for the renegotiation of certain provisions or altering of the price escalator clauses proponents of accelerated and complete deregulation of natural gas are now faced with reregulation pressures various citizen and labor groups are suggesting that natural gas decontrol is a matter of heating or eating and that rhetoric is being taken up by a number of congressional members dear colleague letters are being circulated and a concerted effort is being made to attach language that would freeze gas prices to either the highwaygasoline excise tax measure or a continuing resolution for appropriations the senate finance committee has been the forum for a good deal of the debate on whether the highway tax should be amended to include a natural gas price freeze the house has already passed a different version of a highway gasoline excise tax to increase jobs senate floor action on the highway tax is expected to begin december  or  and that bill could be the target of a natural gas control floor amendment senator thomas f eagleton dmo is spearheading the drive the administration has not taken a visibly active role in opposition to the various legislative proposals that would reregulate gas on an interim basis but a presidential veto could occur if a highway tax bill passes that is loaded down with negative amendments several key members of the senate energy and natural resources committee have expressed opposition on jurisdictional and procedural grounds to any quick fix approach to the complex issue of natural gas pricing a hearing on pending legislation has been scheduled for december  in that committee but the limited witness list is heavily weighted with senators and groups that advocate a gas price freeze cma  on the house side a hearing has been scheduled for december  in the fossil and synthetic fuels subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee only members have been invited to testify full committee chairman john d dingell dmi and subcommittee chairman philip r sharp din have generally indicated that a quick fix approach is not appro priate and that the federal energy regulatory commission should deal with natural gas issues in the shortterm cma has sent to every senator and every house member a letter in opposition to freezing of natural gas wellhead prices and extending of price controls as part of a coalition effort we are also meeting with key senators to discuss the deficiencies of existing law regarding natural gas and the need to deal with natural gas issues in a comprehensive manner in the next congress environment clean air act amendment unlikely in the congressional postelection session there has been no action on amendments to the clean air act despite statements by president reagan and administration officials that continue to cite this as a top economic priority white house pressure for a bill has not materialized senate majority leader howard baker and other senate leaders interested in clean air act amendment needed to be convinced by the white house  not just industry  that passage of a bill this year is essential but several very controversial issues made agreement on a short bill impossible thus the only senate vehicle continues to be the unsatisfactory bill reported november  by the senate environment and public works committee s  report no  this bill otherwise known as the stafford bill is opposed by the industry coalition as well as the administration the section  hazardous air pollutant acid rain and psd prevention of significant deterioration provisions are especially damaging since the november  reelection of environment committee chairman robert stafford rvt who would shepherd s  on the senate floor he has shown no interest in further consideration there already are indications that environment committee staff are preparing improvements for the bill next year the senate committees loss of two northwestern members replaced by another new englander and a midwesterner probably will be helpful to industry next year in the house the industry and administrationsupported luken bill hr  severely damaged during markup relative to psd and section  has been pending in the energy and commerce committee since august in the new congress it is unclear whether the committee balance of power will remain the same or how and when a comprehensive clean air bill might be introduced furthermore we do not know whether congressman james broyhill rnc can continue to prevent passage of a committee bill containing adverse psd cma  or section  provisions we do know that congressman billy tauzin dla intends to actively address section  again tauzin cosponsored with congressman james florio dmj the section  automatic listingdelisting amendment to hr  it is entirely possible that this committee will have an even stronger environmental tilt next year i i by mid the effort will be made to pass some type of clean air act amendment in order to stave off epa enforcement of sanctions in areas not attaining primary ambient air quality standards these sanctions including construction bans and withholding of federal funds for transporta tion and sewage treatment projects become effective december   but are not immediately enforceable environment clean water act amendments stmjed f earlier this year epa leaders determined there was not enough time for congress to consider a comprehensive package of clean water act amendments that they had proposed as a result the agency advanced a set of scaleddown amendments in the hope of making some changes now however the announcement of the special postelection session roused some hopes that time might be available for consideration of a more comprehensive package epas sudden switch in tactics created confusion over what they want in the way of amendments t i i under the short bill epa is considering major changes to the pretreat ment program npdes permits for  years with a reopener clause partial delegation of the npdes program to the states bat deadline extension to july   with the possible option of  to  months to comply with the bat deadlines and the consideration of dams as point sources also being considered is a study of the bat modifications issue which is of prime importance to the chemical industry the study provision is a recognition that the bat issue is important but the chemical industry feels that a modification scheme should be legislated now the senate environment and public works committee chaired by senator robert stafford rvt held a general business meeting on december  and did not consider or report on any of the comprehensive clean water amendments with only a very short time remaining for congress to take action it appears unlikely that any clean water amendments will pass this year adding to this conclusion is the plan by senator john chafee rri chairman of the environ mental pollution subcommittee to hold a hearing on december  focusing on the future of the clean water act and public opinion polls senator chafee has indicated that clean water amendments will be his number one priority in  and he will try to report amendments from his subcommittee by march  the government relations committees clean water act task group will con tinue to work for the necessary legislative changes particularly to the best available technology bat and pretreatment programs through an aggressive hill contacts and focused communications program to assist in these efforts i i i i i i f i cma  cma has developed an extensive package of material on the history of the chemical industrys successes under the clean water act and substantive material which is supportive of our industrys proposed changes to the act environment resource conservation and recovery act passes house dies in senate on september  the house by a vote of  to  approved hr  the resource conservation and recovery act reauthorization this bill authorized appropriations for twa years and makes significant changes in many sections of rcra before final passage the house agreed to a substitute which altered the bill originally reported by the house energy and commerce committee and incorporated modifications advocated by the house public works and trans portation committee the revisions contained in this substitute solved many but not all of the problems that cma initially had with the bill the house also agreed by voice vote to three amendments that were offered on the floor the first offered by mr fifthian dind will increase to  percent the share of cleanup costs provided by the superfund for waste sites owned by a state or municipality but operated by a private contractor an amendment by mr rinaldo rnj will increase the felony penalties under rcra and an amendment by mr dannemeyer rcal will clarify the eligibility of courts to award costs by recorded votes the house rejected amendments by mr gramm dtx to restore the small quantity generator exemption and by mr dannemeyer rcal to delete the section which broadens common law pro visions the action shifted to the senate environment and public works subcommittee on environmental pollution which reported a new package of rcra amendments on september  since a number of issues contained in this amendments package are very controversial landfill van mandatory inspections and small generator inclusion the committee staff spent the next couple of months attempting to develop a consensus on language under pressure to reach a consensus on these important issues senator robert stafford rvt set the rcra amendments aside until  senator john chafee has indicated that he will make rcra amendments his number two priority in  and will try to report a bill from his sub committee by the end of march regulatory reform legislation probably stalled very little possibility now exists that hr  the omnibus regulatory reform bill will be passed in the closing hours of the th congress the business coalition which supports passage of this legislation had apparently secured house leadership support for a compromise that is close to the acceptable language of s  which passed the senate last spring this compromise would be presented to the house by an amendment in the nature of a substitute which would be offered by congressman sam m hall dtx and congressman tom kindness cma  t i late breaking opposition m the house rules committee to granting a rule to permit floor consideration of hr  and the hallkindness amendment has all but foreclosed the possibility of passage in the th congress j j patent term restoration blocked in rules committee passage of hr  the patent term restoration act is only a dim possibility in the postelection session of congress this important legislation would extend the term of a patent by up to  years for the period during which commercial use of a product or process is delayed because of government mandated testing and review the principal obstacle to passage of hr  is obtaining an appropriate rule from the house committee on rules to bring this bill up for a vote on the house floor it is anticipated that hr  which earlier received only  votes less than the twothirds required for passage of bills considered on suspension of the rules would then be passed by the house the business coalition and cma are seeking a modified closed rule which would permit consideration of the bill and germane amendments on the house floor j j i the outlook is bleak because two powerful rules committee members pepper and bolling oppose the bill as does house speaker oneill transportation filibuster threatens maritime reform bill the biggest obstacle to passage of a maritime reform bill in the post election session seems to be a threatened filibuster by senator howard m metzenbaum doh senator william proxmire dwi has indicated that he will support an effort to prevent passage of the legislation and senators max baucus dmt and j james exon dne may also register opposition previous opposition to the bill by senator strom thurmond rsc has been with drawn even though there is only limited opposition to the shippercarrier agreed upon bill sufficient time may not exist to consider the bill the senate leadership have advised surface transportation subcommittee chairman slade gorton rwa that floor time will be scheduled to bring up the measure but is is evident given the otherissues present and items scheduled that there may not be enough time for a floor vote floor action is scheduled for december  yet the bill could well be carried on the agenda for the remainder of the session the senate bill under consideration has been revised and more closely reflects the house passed version the revisions are supported by cma the shippercarrier coalition and the administration additional cma proposed technical and substantive amendments have also been basically incorporated into the substitute senate version clarifying floor statements have further been prepared and the bill has in essence been preconferenced with members and staff of the house merchant marine and judiciary committees m i i cma  in the event that a maritime reform bill is not adopted during the postelection session there is little likelihood of a bill going forward immediately in the next congress consensus among coalition members is doubtful and the arduous drafting process to date has left in question many of the basic principles involved there is no doubt however that shippers have averted what was initially an unbalanced carrier relief bill nearly a year of negotiations with legislative sponsors carrier representatives and the administration have resulted in substantial agreement on the direction of legislation affecting the us maritime fleet it is believed by all parties that progress has been made trade reciprocity legislation there is concern in the congress about the  billion trade deficit with japan and a growing concern about us trade policy the failure of the gatt ministerial meeting in late november  has caused a further deepening of this concern senator john danforth rmo of the senate finance committee and chairman of its international trade subcommittee focused congressional trade policy interest in the reciprocal trade and investment act of  s  it provides for presidential authority to deal with unfair trade practices pro tection of intellectual property rights and inequitable investment restrictions by other governments the bill was generally acceptable to both the senate and the house on its merits the senate finance committee reported the bill but potentially crippling amendments threatened and the maneuvering to eliminate them prevent d a floor vote the bill was than added by the senate to a housepassed miscellaneous tariff bill hr  the international trade and investment act however the house ways and means committee did not act on s  except to hold hearings the chemical industry took a great deal of interest in this major piece of trade legislation a number of chemical companies were leaders in an industry coalition effort to get the bill passed cma adopted a policy of approval of the bill and opposed amendments of particular concern was the proposed frenzel amendment hr  section  of the trade act of  to include extension of the presidents authority to further reduce tariffs the th congress will take up legislation of this nature at this time it is not clear whether it will be in the same form as s  in any case the new congress is likely to be more protectionist than the last one this poses serious problems particularly if the bill requiring all cars sold in the united states to use up to  percent american parts and labor hr  continues its current popularity in the congress trade bilateral investment treaties the united states has established a program of negotiating bilateral cma  investment treaties with developing countries egypt and panama have recently signed such treaties there are twentysix other countries under active consideration by the trade representatives office for future treaties cma has been provided with the list of prospective countries the cma international trade committee believes the bit program holds considerable promise for resolving some of the foreign investment problems of the future for this reason an active liaison has been established between the cma investment policy task group and the trade representatives office this group expects to provide advice and aid to the trade representatives office as additional treaties are negotiated the industrys ability to be effective in the investment area is enhanced by the membership of mr dexter baker air products on ambassador brocks investment policy advisory committee trade  report of hazardous substances federal policy formation of an administration policy on the export of hazardous sub stances remains active and close to a conclusion on february   president reagan revoked a president carter executive order which put controls on the export of hazardous or restricted products the major stake for the chemical industry was about  percent of  billion of exports which are not registered in the united states the president at the same time requested from the secretaries of commerce and state a proposal to improve the export notification system already existing in various laws a joint proposal from secretaries baldridge and haig was cleared by a trade policy committee chaired by trade representative ambassador brock the close liaison of the international trade committee with the two agencies in development of the proposal was continued with the visit of a small delegation to the white house staff person responsible for the white house course of action subsequently the draft proposal for a new president reagan executive order was published it calls for new regulations and legislative proposals the draft proposal is acceptable to the chemical industry in its present form con siderable difficulty lies ahead due to the complexity of the many existing laws and regulations to be affected trade usmexican petrochemical discussions the us department of commerce has been fully informed by cma that petro chemical difficulties lie ahead between the us and mexico this will result from a large expansion of petrochemical capacity in mexico canada and saudi arabia in the face of existing extreme overcapacity in the traditional pro ducing countries after a discussion between president reagan and president portillo of mexico a joint commission on coirenerce and trade jcct was formed and industry discussions on five sectors including pertochemicals were agreed upon cma subsequently provided a group of expert advisors to the government who are participating in a governmentcontrolled advisory committee this group is i k cma  currently working on objectives to be sought by the us government in future discussions there have been two governmenttogovernment orientation meetings without industry advisors further discussions have delayed until the new de la madrid administration is fully functioning the cma international trade committee has been maintaining close liaison with government on the petrochemical discussions it has constructed its set of objectives for the discussions which were approved by the executive committee and forwarded to the department of commerce these objectives will be considered fully along with those of the official advisors group early in november it was discovered that the us and mexican governments had quietly negotiated a new bilateral trade agreement the intent of the agree ment was to reduce mexican subsidization of industrial goods in return for application of the injury test in us countervailing duty actions against mexican imports this injury test is not now applied to such imports because mexico does not belong to the gatt and therefore cannot sign the gatt sub sidies code on learning of the trade agreement cma immediately made known its views that the industry was not properly consulted on the trade agreement the trade representatives office convened a small meeting within two days with representatives of several industries present to discuss the text of the agree ment on hearing of this development the mexican government withdrew its support of the agreement the us department of commerce apparently intends to submit the agreement to the industry consultative process and approach mexico again while the draft trade agreement had the well intentioned objective of reducing mexican subsidization the agreement a written clearly would not accomplish this tsca ota report on pmn program expected in january the final report on otas review of the quality and quantity of the infor mation contained in premanufacture notifications submitted to epa under section  of tsca is expected to be completed early in  ota undertook this review at the request of congressman florio dnj expectations were that the final report depending on the study results might be used by mr florio in a campaign to require a fixed set of testing for all new chemicals similar to the europeans th amendment and oecds minimum premarket data preliminary indications are however that otas conclusions do not seriously attack epas administration of the pmn program tsca gao study of pmns underway congressman florio recently requested another study of the pmn program this one by the government accounting office gao this study will analyze epas process for reviewing pmns and making decisions of unreasonable risk the level of epas enforcement efforts and on site inspections regarding pmns and the procedural and policy differences between the us and europeans approach including testing exemptions and follow up procedures one part of the gao study is expected to be done by february with the balance to be completed by the end of the summer cma  tsca gao study on section  testing completed in the meantime gao has completed a study for the senate environment and public works committee on epas implementation of selected aspects of tsca this study focuses on epas use and legality of negotiatedvoluntary testing agreements in lieu of formal test rules under section  of tsca the asbestos control program and procedures for conducting risk assessments the gao study is due for release on december   and no bombshells are expected it may be factored into tsca reauthorization hearings held in  i tsca reauthorizationoversight hearings in  congressman florio dnj anticipates a comprehensive review of epas implementation of tsca in reauthoriation hearings in the th congress no dates have been set and all subcommittee chairmanships and jurisdictions must be approved early in  nevertheless mr florio is expected to continue to chair the subcommittee with responsibility for tsca presently commerce and transportation he is likely to hold tsca reauthorization and oversight hearings in the februarytomarch timeframe depending in part on his schedule for dealing with other important issues before his subcommittee including superfund rcra groundwater railroad legislation and the like mr florio is said to be weighing amendments to tsca and cma is preparing to counter efforts to open up a law which given reasonable implementation is a viable and effective approach to regulating hazardous chemical substances in the senate on the other hand some uncertainties surround the environment and public works committee senators slade gorton rwash who chaired the toxic substances and environmental oversight subcommittee and frank murkowski ralaska have chosen to leave this committee replacing them will be senators gordon humphrey rnh and dave durenberger rminn one of who may chair the subcommittee with jurisdiction over tsca formerly headed by mr gorton however the subcommittee jurisdictions have not yet been settled and some rearranging is possible thus it is too early to know whether when and by whom tsca reauthorization hearings will be held in  by the senate osha reform i task group

during the last few months of  was generally slow since most states had adjourned before the november elections however lame duck sessions continued well into december in california massachusetts new york and michigan to resolve unfinished business particularly related to budget shortfalls in addition the new jersey legislature continued to meet in their regular  session among its other distinctions new jersey will be the only legislature to carry bills over into next year sy early january the vast majority of state legislatures will be reorganized and beginning the very busy first year of their biennium legis lative activity is expected to be extremely heavy during the first six months of  and will probably peak in april state election results the november elections brought much larger shifts for the democrats in the states than it did in congress the democratic party now has complete control of  state legislatures in addition to  governorships further democrats now control both the legislature and the governorship in  states the situation in individual states is as follows the democrats captured legislative houses from the republicans in delaware illinois iowa maine montana ohio north dakota pennsylvania and washington republicans will control both chambers in alaska arizona colorado idaho indiana kansas new hampshire south dakota utah vermont and wisconsin the parties will share control of both chambers in montana new york north dakota and pennsylvania the democrats wrested control of the governors office from the republicans in the following states alaska arkansas michigan minnesota nebraska nevada ohio texas and wisconsin the republicans scored upset gubernatorial victories in california and n w hampshire committee and task group activity major projects by the sasc and its task groups were geared toward ensuring that the state affairs professionals in the industry are adequately prepared for the onslaught of the  legislative sessions the following represent major cma  activities that are distinct from particular issues or bills or regulations which are discussed in some detail subsequently three regional state affairs seminars were held in new york atlanta and chicago during october and november total attendance was approximately  and interaction with cics and other state groups was high sasc task groups developed and presented program segments on hazardous waste right to know hazardous materials transportation state cancer policies and air and water quality in addition major corporate epa regional and state lobbyist representatives were featured speakers although numerous ideas for improving the programs have developed from these sessions these seminars represented another significant step in cmas state affairs program outreach efforts another series of seminars is contemplated in late  the network task group is involved in several projects designed to enhance the industrys ability to impact legislative and regulatory activities in specific states first the cma state network formed during  is being reviewed and strengthened to ensure that key industry issues the existing network is being surveyed as to how participants utilized the material distributed to them in  and what kinds of assistance would be most helpful in  in addition a state government relations resource survey is in the draft stage which is designed to identify chemical industry lobbying resources in key states and to pinpoint individuals and organizations that can be utilized in state activities finally the task group is following and encouraging cic development in states such as massachusetts kentucky and florida the electronic services task group completed contract discussions with the vendor for state computer based legislative and regulatory tracking services discussions continued through december on implementation of the agreement state issues update state right to know remains legislatively active in

of extensive public hearings around the state in october these hearings were characterized by highly emotional testimony cma  demonstrations ard other media directed activities the instigators of these activities were local environmentalcitizen groups and to a lesser extent organized labor although it appeared originally that committee markup might take place in november or december further action has been postponed until after the first of the year in the interim the new jersey chemical industry council and chamber of commerce are working jointly on industrys response in  we expect

waste support task group on develop ing a mechanism to provide direct technical and legal support to industry representatives on state hazardous waste bills andor regulations legislative activity on hazardous waste during the last few months of  was limited to only a few states the outlook for state superfund in massachusetts remained uncertain as the year ended although industry was dissatisfied with the king administrations cma  revised proposal which was circulating in december the perception of prob able legislation that would emerge in  was even worse michigan enacted hb  into law during november this superfund bill was by and large acceptable to industry although the actual source of financing in future years is still not clear discussions have continued in new jersey on ab  which contains compre hensive amendments to the states spill fund there is a good chance that the tax will move away from feedstock to some sort of waste end fee it is likely that the fund will remain a combined oilchemical spill fund action is not likely until  industry groups in tennessee continue to work on drafts of state superfund and siting bills for consideration in  in california the department of health services continued to push forward its proposed regulations to limit the landfilling of certain categories of hazardous waste the current regulations represent a marked improvement over the executive order originally put forward by governor brown in  air and water quality a priority for the state affairs special committee environmental task group for  is the development of a policy paper on state regulation of hazardous air pollutants the task group has begun preliminary work on the concepts involved and will work with the appropriate emc groups to reach an acceptable position this activity has been spurred on by the california air resources boards attempt to finalize hazardous air pollutant regulations by the end of  the california legislature unanimously passed a resolution urging them to hold off final action until the new administration took office the task group will also be working with the emc groundwater task group on promoting cmas new groundwater policy and strategy in the states during  finally the task group will be monitoring cancer and other chronic disease issues in the states and will work to ensure that the industrys technical expertise is made available where appropriate hazardous materials transportation cma staff and member company representatives participated in a hazardous materials transportation conference in denver sponsored by the national conference of state legislatures this conference was part of the continuing dialogue on the appropriate roles of federal state and local governments in regulating

expected to pass before the end of the year discussions are continuing with the interindustry coalition on advocating a consensus good samaritan bill in  progress has been good and we anticipate a coordinated broad based effort to pass this legislation to take place in many states next year to support this effort the hazardous materials transportation task group is working with the distribution committee on developing good samaritan advocacy materials for distribution to our state contacts finally the proposed alabama regulation requiring prenotification of shipments of hazardous waste has

behalf of the superfund funding task group in respect of its charge to study further the arco gross receipts tax proposal the task group after due consideration again rejected that tax proposal previously the tax policy committee had also rejected the proposal before the executive committee and board of cma at this time is a modification to the existing position on superfund funding specifically cma would modify its existing position to include support for the use of borrowing as a safety valve to support actual site cleanup after the trust fund revenues had been exhausted borrowing in any one year would be limited to  million and repayment of any borrowings should be amortized over a year period installments of principal and interest should be paid first from cost recoveries and then to the extent needed from the trust fund this proposal tightly limits funding as does cmas present position earlier mr holmer had testified on reauthorization in the senate and his testimony reflected an  million total annual funding i recommend for your approval the task groups proposal i would like to further suggest that cma get busy and address the issue before the tax writing committees of congress legislation will soon come out of the congressional committees concerned with environmental issues and pass to the committees cma  t concerned with raising revenues while we can support the cma position i am convinced that we must address a more i serious longterm issue the chemical industry faces a major problem a problem so severe it shakes cma and many of the companies obvious conflicts of view that are serious there are they are serious because each tax proposal can have a major adverse impact on j j some of the companies within the industry our argument can be that this industry supports reauthorization at the  million level with a limited annual borrowing authorization however this industry does not have the r venue capacity to fund the major societal cost of a new welfare program j j i no one especially our legislators should be allowed to lose sight of the fact that a complete cleanup of all hazardous waste sites in the united states is another w lfare program and that becomes particularly true if the victim compensation legislation is married to this program t we must make the cogent economic arguments and make them in terms that are both believable and realistic even at a  billion annual funding level the chemical industry does not collapse however the real effect when the tax becomes centered on a very narrow revenue base of give or take seven chemicals and give or take  companies is that an erosion begins that moves production of the particular chemicals off shore erosion may be more pernicious than collapse that cma  erosion will soon begin because for most of the affected chemicals there is worldwide excess capacity from the point ofview of the chemical companies the fact that the production may move from united states sources to foreign sources may be good news or bad news depending upon the individual companys worldwide capacity situation and worldwide market position from a united states government viewpoint any movement of production out of the united states defeats the revenue raising capability of the tax thus the tax simply wont work as its rate goes up revenue base this tax commits suicide by killing its moreover its erosive effect diminishes the general income tax base as well the staffs of the committees responsible for raising revenues can be made to understand this argument however we must articulate it carefully and without overstatement because overstatement will be followed by complete disbelief and we cannot afford that consequence we can make a strong positive argument for a wasteend tax based on its equity and fairness equity in that it compels people to do what they ought to do that is simply dispose of their waste in an environmentally safe fashion fairness in that all those who dispose of waste pay a reason able amount of tax while we as an industry can fund most of a reasonable program we cannot fund grandiose schemes such schemes must be considered in the great revenue debates that will occur beginning in  and carry on into a new congress and adminis tration we must convey this message in washington cma t gentlemen it is time to quit feeding maidens to the dragon and instead go find us some good st georgetype defenders i do not merely advocate that we try harder but instead that we try smarter j lets mobilize the resources of the industry to canvass capitol hill in a joint industry effort to destroy this theory that one industry can cure a vast societal problem i specifically recommend that we put together twoperson teams that would include one person with j governmentallobbying experience and one person with a tax economic background to lobby the staff and members of the ways i and means committee and finance committee carrying the message i i have outlined above i  specifically recommend that we train these people with the message that we want conveyed to the hill and that we dedicate the numbers of people needed to do a thorough competent job if we are defeated on this issue it must not be because any staff or congressional member can i j legitimately say no one from industry told him there was a problem i have already discussed this matter generally with the cma government relation committee leaders now i know there are some who believe the deal has already been cut by the democractic majority in the house and that the senate will offer no effective resistance to that deal if this is so then nothing we do whatever course we decide to follow will make any difference rather than assume we are defeated i would prefer to see us proceed with an activitist campaign r member if you are going to get your throat slit it makes v ry little difference if they draw the knife right to left or left to right this industry cannot bear the impact of cma  s ever growing frontend wasteend or other tax mechanisms it must convey the message that it will support a reasonable reauthorization of superfund but that it will resist in the strongest fashion the broad expansion of that legislation we must tell the story in an honest responsible and direct fashion if that should include a massive grass roots effort then lets get at it then lets be stronger if it means a stronger lobbying effort whatever it takes lets get on with the business of protecting this industry cma cma  exhibit cl alternate sources of superfund revenue discussion in april the executive committee and board of directors approved the recommendation of the superfund funding taste group for supplemental revenue options for the superfund site cleanup program in brief the recommendations adopted were o to impose a tax of  per dry weight ton on the disposal of hazardous waste to produce the first  million in tax revenues for the superfund site cleanup program o to raise revenues over  million maintain the existing feedstock taxes with three principal amendments  a adoption of technical amendments package b specifically exempt hydrocarbons used in gasoline from separate taxation as chemicals c freeze level of revenues to be raised from the current taxes at approximately  million per annum o to continue funding from government general revenues at  percent or approximately  million per annum o to provide epa borrowing authority of up to  million per annum task group to develop details the executive committee and board of directors directed the task group to study further an arco proposal to tax certain corporate gross receipts on may  edwin c holmer testified on behalf of cma before the senate committee on environment and public works on superfund reauthorization in that testimony mr holmer presented a proposed funding mechanism to match annual epa spending needs of approximately  million that proposal includes the components discussed above and would raise  million in addition he noted that  million would be provided from cost recoveries and interest for total superfund revenues of  million in response to the directive of the executive committee the task group met on may   to determine what is the preferred mechanism to fund or to finance an additional  million per annum the executive committee specifically requested that the task group present a recommendation on whether cma should adopt the arco proposal to impose a tax on corporate gross receipts or if not what alternative financing mechanisms should be adopted to raise this additional revenue after extended discussion a majority of the task group declined to recommend a tax on corporate gross receipts as an appropriate means to raise  million it should be noted that the task group was closely divided on this issue and that the minority strongly supported the gross receipts proposal in this respect congress may consider the gross receipts tax the value added tax and other general tax increase proposals in  to reduce the federal budget deficit cma   the task group agreed that the preferred mechanism to finance the next  million increment for the superfund program would be to provide epa with safety valve borrowing authority in that amount the task group modified its previous proposal on this subject the basic elements of the new proposal include expanded borrowing authority should be considered a safety valve that is the authority to borrow would be available only to finance actual superfund site cleanup expenses after the revenues in the trust fund have been expended expanded borrowing authority would be limited in any given year to  million repayment of amounts borrowed should be amortized over a year period installments of principal and interest should be paid first from cost recoveries and then to the extent needed from trust fund revenues the new borrowing authority would be repaid from cost recoveries and through trust fund revenues from contributors to the fund thus this new authority would leverage tax payments to meet current epa spending needs with the implied commitment of fund contributors to repay these amounts over time the second preferred option would be to appropriate from general government revenues an additional  million per year the task group views the added contribution from general revenues like the tax on corporate gross receipts as a means to expand contributions to the fund from industry and the public at large the third preferred option but which is not endorsed by the task group would be to modify or to expand the present cercla taxes possible modification could include o taxing benzene toluene and xylene used in gasoline separately o increasing the per barrel tax on petroleum from the present o cents per barrel level o doubling the proposed tax on hazardous waste disposal o expanding the list of feedstocks subject to the cercla taxes to include products named in recent legislation o increasing all cercla feedstock taxes to not more than  percent of sales price cma   it should be reemphasized that the task group does not recommend anjr of these tax increases at this time but that they may be preferable to doubling the existing cercla taxes recommendation that cma endorse expanded epa safety valve borrowing authority of up to  million par year to finance superfund site cleanup costs action required approval cma cma  exhibit d economic impact of cercla funding proposal  waste end tax at its may   meeting the cma executive committee was informed of the existence of the superfund economic impact working group which is examining the impact which fees included in different proposals for superfund re authorization would have on the chemical industry a paper presented at that meeting argued that the petrochemical sector would be the industry sector most affected by an increase in cercla feedstock taxes and those taxes would likely exceed the petrochemical industrys ability to pay them the cma executive committee has requested that the superfund economic impact working group consider the affect of the imposition of a  per ton tax on the industry such an analysis has been conducted based on a survey where some  cma member companies reported on their total amount of waste and its disposition the analysis used the amount of waste disposed of in  as reported in the aforementioned survey and compared the  per ton fee with  sales and earnings with one exception waste end taxes would be less than  percent of profits and less than  percent of sales action required for information only w cma  exhibit dl suferfumd economic impact study discussion an interim report of the superfund economic impact study group was reviewed for the executive committee on may  the report concentrated on the petro chemical feedstock tax which provides the largest portion of the hazardous waste trust fund revenue and has the greatest amount of analytical data avail able in the public domain the executive committee approved the summary paper on the economic impact of increased feedstock taxes for use by association representatives in superfund reauthorization discussions with congress additionally the group was directed to broaden the study to include the impact of wasteend taxes which exceeded the  millionyear of the cma proposal and to also include other revenue proposals currently before congress subsequent to this directive hr s was introduced with a feedstock tax and a wasteend tax on disposal as the principal funding vehicles  rates were four times greater than those proposed by cma for the feedstock tax and at least three times greater for some major disposal categories in the wasteend option it is therefore apparent that a cma economic impact statement must consider how cmas feedstock and wasteend tax concepts are economically superior to cercla taxes the cercla feedstock tax has been in effect for three years and irs provides data on collections quarterly which is analyzed by product and number of tax payers it is possible to compare the taxes paid with information in the public domain on production rates sales revenue and profits for the industry sector under cercla the industry paid taxes on  primary petrochemicals of  million dollars annually although this tax revenue is about  percent below legislatively projected collections it amounted to  percent of sales revenue collections could not be compared with profits since those products showed a net loss for  and  combined hr  would increase annual taxes to more theui  million dollars and set the rate at more than  percent of sales cerclas postclosure tax is a wasteend tax which is somewhat comparable to cmas proposed wasteend tax it differs in tax rate and covers fewer waste disposal categories it has been in effect only since the fourth quarter of  and collection results are minimal nevertheless when these collection data are adjusted from cmas higher proposed tax rates st and greater coverage it supports the potential for a wasteend tax revenue of  million annually cmas wasteend tax proposal in order to get a rough assessment of the impact of a wasteend tax on cma membership waste disposal quantities on a dry weight basis of  member company respondents out of  us cma member companies were compared on a cma  confidential basis with sales revenues and earnings of those companies staff analyzed potential ssost dry weight wasteend tax liability of cma member companies using  waste disposal and  chemical salesprofits with the cma wasteend tax proposal as the tax vehicle responding cma member company impacts on an annual basis would be the following j cma o comparison with anticipated revenuesw expected that  cma member companies would pay  million of the  million annual sst dry weight tax  members in the respondent group would pay  million or  percent of anticipated taxes for the entire cma membership o concentrationten of  respondents would pay  million of the  million total o economic impactof the top  taxpayers two lost money in  a third company would pay  percent of earnings and the remaining seven would pay  to  percent of earnings none of those taxpayers would pay more than  percent of sales outside of the  top taxpayers none of the remaining  would be taxed in excess of  percent of earnings i i j hr  wasteend tax when data on industry averages are used it appears that the wasteend tax of hr  could cost cma members as much as  percent of cmas sst proposal since hr  would tax dilute streams with low solids content on a liquid basis rather than a dry weight basis the  to metric ton tax on the liquids basis could be as much as  to st on a dry weight basis companies disposing of streams more dilute than average would of course pay even higher rates and be penalized for water added to make the waste disposal safer and improve operability jobsimportsexportsbalance of payments two econometric models which we hoped to adapt to show the impact of higher taxes on petrochemical investment jobs and balance of payments were found to be not sufficiently sensitive or convertible on a timely basis for that purpose we are revising methodology to use an empirical approach to analysis of past data to develop projections of economic impacts the results will likely rely on examples rather than completely quantitative results but will demonstrate that excessive superfund taxes will adversely affect jobs international competitiveness and balance of payments in petrochemicals action required ec d for information only hugh irvine cma  exhibit e report on public compensation to the executive committee as requested by the executive committee the public compensation task group has continued to analyze various issues related to public compensation in this report the task group has defined advocacy alternatives for waste site compensation that might be appropriate for several possible outcomes of the study of the health effects associated with waste sites being done by the universities associated for research and education in pathology uarep the task group has also prepared a brief summary on workplace disease compensation that includes advocacy concepts still under review this report has three sections o section i status of public compensation legislation provides a brief update of federal and state legislative initiatives in public compensation o section ii compensation for waste site injuries outlines advocacy alternatives that might be appropriate for various uarep study scenarios o section iii workplace disease compensation includes brief background information on the subject a description of other advocacy groups activity in the issue and a list of options that the task group is still reviewing by way of an additional update the uarep study is on schedule and under budget uarep has adopted management practices that enable the study to stay on track the uarep executive science panel met on may  and  to assemble the separate chapters of the study into an initial draft this draft was then reworked into a review draft at the end of may because the terms of the contract guarantee uareps complete independence cka has no knowledge of the drafts substantive content the board of sponsors has suggested that uarep conduct a peer review of the draft document before its release for general public comment a peer review would take  to  weeks and would move the documents public release to late july or early august a work group of company representatives and cma staff are preparing a communications program to discuss the uarep study results cma  t i j i status of public compensation legislation rep florios new superfund reauthorization bill hr  on may   congressman florio introduced a new compromise superfund bill this staff product of rep florio dingell and other key members was prepared after the house commerce transportation and tourism subcommittee voted  to reject the original florio bill of february   hr  hearings on the bill have not been held but ve expect markup to take place on may  the bill will then begin moving through the house for action this year because of compromises made by key congressional members and its broadbased sponsorship the bill does not create an administrative scheme or provide funding for personal injury claims there are no shifting burdens of proof for proving causation the bill would create a new federal cause of action however allowing persons alleging injury from waste sites to bring a tort suit in federal court liability under the bill is strict joint and several with provisions allowing courts to apportion damages and defendants to show that responsibility for damages was divisible despite the strict joint and several liability provisions in the bill some congressmen and advocacy groups are reluctant to support this portion of the bill because the administrative fund concept has been deleted politically they believe the federal cause of action giving victims injured by waste site substances a viable federal avenue of redress would weaken the case for an administrative fund the bill itself is a recent development and deserves further study i  j i j i i j i j i senate hearings on superfund reauthorization on may   mr edwin c holmer testified on behalf of cma on various superfund reauthorization issues including public compensation cmas testimony which paralleled comments made in the past called for separating the compensation issue from waste site cleanup and for obtaining more scientific information on possible waste site disease relationships j j although no companion bill to mr florios hr  has been introduced in the senate sen staffords committee on environment and public works asked cma to address public compensation issues similar to those raised by rep florios its unclear whether the senate will act on a public compensation measure this term although the prospects for such action at this time remain unlikely the senate leadership legislative priorities and limited time remaining in this session make it difficult for public compensation advocates in the senate to act j massachusetts study commission on waste site compensation a study commission established by the massachusetts legislature has been holding hearings on compensation for waste site injuries the commission is examining the adequacy of existing legal remedies in massachusetts for  these injuries and the necessity for an administrative fund the study of health effects at the woburn site is fueling the debate in this state cma  members of the task group and cma staff have worked with the state industry representatives to brief them on cmas public compensation activities and to help elicit testimony before the commission from key individuals hearings will end on june  a preliminary report outlining issues will be released in the early summer and a final report will be published by spring  dr bruce karrh dupont is scheduled to testify before the hearings finish at the end of june new jersey victims compensation bill victims compensation legislation was introduced in new jersey earlier this year which would establish an administrative compensation fund financed by industry fees which would also have the potential to adversely impact the tort system originally hearings had bfen expected to be held as early as march however committee activity is now not expected to begin before june and possibly not until the summer or early fall despite the delays in moving the legislation the potential for the passage of onerous and precedent setting legislation remains high if the sponsors decide to aggressively move the proposal with this in mind state affairs committee members and cma staff have been working closely with the new jersey chemical industry council preparing for the possibility of hearings and substantive discussions on the bill new jersey cic representatives have met privately with the sponsor to determine his schedule and priorities with with respect to the bill activity on both the federal and state fronts will continue to be closely coordinated to the maximum possible extent to ensure consistency in the chemical industrys position ti cma  ii compensation for waste site injuries the uarep study has proceeded under conditions which precluded cmas acquiring knowledge of its direction or potential conclusion to minimize surprise the task force has postulated four scenarios and discussed cmas possible actions in response to each the scenarios are as follows o scenario i a major national public health problem exists as a result of exposure to hazardous waste sites a substantial population is at risk a substantial number of exposed persons have manifested chronic disease of a type reasonably related to the exposure a substantial number of persons have been exposed and have not as yet manifested a chronic disease or its symptoms latency group but realistically fear the onset of chronic disease o scenario ii a minor public health problem exists as a result of exposure to hazardous waste sites a small population is at risk a limited number of persons have manifested chronic disease of a type reasonably related to the exposure a small number of persons have been exposed and have not as yet manifested chronic disease or its symptoms latency group but realistically fear the onset of chronic disease o scenario iii the data generated by the study is incomplete equivocal or unverlflable so that no inferences may be drawn concerning human health effects resulting from exposure to hazardous waste sites o scenario iv no public health problem exists as a result of exposure to hazardous waste sites in any population nor will any population in the future suffer adverse health consequences as a result of exposure to hazardous waste sites while cka has no information from uapep on the studys conclusions the task group believes scenarios i and iv are unlikely and that scenarios ii and iii are most probable nevertheless scenarios i and iv were considered in order to be complete in preparing for the studys release sthe chart below summarizes how the various advocacy options that the task group has considered might apply under the four uarep scenarios iarep final report  possible scenarios major problem  widespread exposure and problems with disease ii minor problem  limited exposure and few problems with disease iii incomplete data  no conclusions need for additional data collection iv no problem of public health parep scenarios i ii iii iv x x cma options cercla s  health surveillance xx private insurance x administrative fund x federal cause of action xx x xx o public health surveillance at waste sites most of the proposals related to victims compensation have attempted to deal with the issue in one of two ways  establish a nofault federal adminis trative fund to reimburse alleged victims and  change existing tort law to shift the burden of proof to a defendant and force him to prove a negative the task croup recognized that both of these changes were attempts to deal with the problem of causation or the relationship between exposure to a hazardous substance and a disease causation has been the central issue of debate on victims compensation cma  after two yeers of struggle with the causation issue the task group has been unable to develop any system that would change current standards of scientific and legal proof yet still be intellectually acceptable past experience with federal administrative funds clearly illustrated the dangers of gradually increasing coverage along with an almost geometric growth in fund size changes in burden of proof does violence to scientific notions of cause and effect there is moreover a real danger that such a change in the tort law will be carried over to workers compensation and product liability the task group agreed that a middle ground was needed our goal was to develop a positive program chat would deal with public perceptions of the hazardous waste exposure problem we recommend that cma support a revision of section  and s of cercla to provide for more site specific health studies and medical monitoring at old hazardous waste sices our proposed changes to the statute would give the centers for disease control cdc new authority to investigate health concerns around waste sites in situations chat posed less than a public health emergency only public emergencies can now be investigated cdc would be able to conduct health status surveys and screening programs of people exposed to hazardous substances our approach treats the public perception that old waste sices are causing disease and illness as a public health problem rather than a problem of how to deliver compensation under the current or any proposed legal system the objectives of our proposed changes to section  are provide greater flexibility than now exists to utilize that section for medical surveillance limit the surveillance to individuals demonstrating actual exposure from hazardous substances as defined in cercla and restrict ing application of tha section to site specific exposures from old  sites rather chan ambient exposures the proposed statutory change allows the administrator hew discretion in developing the protocols for such surveillance it was the cask groups consensus that we would be better advised not to put too much detail in the statute end instead work with the applicable agency on the proper protocol or scheme used to carry out the statutory mandate further this approach allows us to build on the uaref study under any of the possible results of that work the approach suggested here could be used o insurance coverage for people exposed to waste site sub stances in the event government health officials determine that people adjacent to waste sites have been significantly exposed to hazardous substances the longterm health status of the exposed population would be uncertain to those who were exposed the uncertainty of contracting a chronic disease will likely persist in the form of fear and anxiety cma  the task croup is recommending adoption of private party insurance policies for people exposed to hazardous waste substances these would be similar to the structured settlements of cort suits that some companies have used to resolve environmental litigation cases the task group is not recommending legislative changes at this time but is studying further whether federal government involvement in this matter would be appropriate the insurance policy would apply to people exposed to waste site substances but who have not manifested disease at the election of responsible parties who are identified and connected with a waste sitethe exposed population would be offered a fullypaid insurance policy this policy would cover periodic medical testing and examination for evidence of a designated chronic disease or diseases likely to be caused by the exposure these examinations would continue for the life of the individual if the disease develops the policy would pay all medical expenses lost wages or earnings burial expenses and a lump sum for anxiety and psychological trauma associated with the disease an individual accepting the insurance coverage would waive hisher tort rights against the responsible party or parties providing the insurance coverage the task group believes the private party insurance approach affords companies several advantages including reducing the fear compo nent accompanying the exposure two of these advantages are eliminating litigation costs and obtaining epidemiology data to better understand cause and effect relationships between exposure to waste sice substances and chronic disease it offers the exposed population the obvious benefits of medical examinations and if the designated disease ensues health care and money the utility of this option will depend on the extent to which people have been exposed to waste site substances and therefore the number of people who potentially would qualify for this insurance plan the task group plans to work with insurance representatives to determine the costs of this option o administrative fund if it should become necessary to establish a separate system to compensate people for chronic disease caused by waste sites the cask group recommends adoption of the concepts and principles provided the executive committee in april  cma would be prepared to argue chat the principles of eligibility damages causation exclusivity funding and delivery mechanism chat we prepared last year should apply in any administrative fund that the government tried to set up the task group has modified the original damages principle proposed to the executive committee in  the change involves capping any damages award to an eligible claimant and offsetting it with money he received from employment or ocher entitlement programs other than for damages the waste compensation principles proposed a year ago for an administrative fund remain intact cma  members of the task group believe an administrative fund for hazardous waste compensation would be appropriate only under uarep scenario i where the study shoved a major national health problem exists past experience with other government programs involving industry  financed funds eg the black lung program warrants proceeding with an administrative fund only where other legal remedies prove inadequate such a situation might exist where large numbers of claimants injured by waste site substances would swamp the tort system and other compensation alternatives until this occurred though the task group believes a federal administrative fund should be avoided o federal cause of action in its simplest form a federal cause of action would give plaintiffs a right of access to federal courts to pursue their tort claims for injuries received from exposure to waste site substances such a right exists today under federal statute for many claimants in modified form a federal cause of action might be accompanied by other elements affecting liability such as causation presumptions shifting burdens of proof and strict standards of liability once a federal cause of action became law court interpretation and congressional tinkering could easily modify the federal right as originally conceived by congress and adversely affect companies liability for these reasons the task group believes there are significant risks in endorsing a federal cause of action provision in any legislation on the other hand if our companies were forced to choose among options such as a federal administrative fund changes in burdens of proof or causation presumptions the task group would prefer a clean federal cause of action t l j i i i i j j i i a federal cause of action might be appropriate under any of the four uarep scenarios depending upon other legislative proposals in contrast to the recommended cercla section  change cma would be more hesitant to advocate adoption of a federal cause of action most likely it would be a position to which cma would retreat in the face of other more onerous legislative proposals i cma  iii workplace disease compensation background the workers compensation laws of all  states provide broad coverage for disability or death due to occupationally related disease the administrative system in place in the states are fairly efficient in their operations and are designed to deliver prompt benefits at a low transaction cost benefit funding mechanisms in use by selfinsured employers and insurance carriers are reliable and reasonably efficient no state program has yet experienced unmanageable numbers of occupational disease claims while the existing workplace benefit systems are sound there has been a growing perception that workplace disease victims are not treated fairly under workers compensation laws although state laws vary considerably criticisms of the existing system suggest  that benefit amounts paid are coo low  that arbitrary notice and filing limitations operate to bar many otherwise valid claims and  chat proof of occupational causation is too difficult or costly to obtain some or all of these views are shared by organized labor some other employee groups some employers some legislators and some prominent academicians from an employers or manufacturers perspective it is clear that workplace disease claims are with increasing frequency finding their way into the tort system in the case of a workplace exposure to a known or suspected toxic substance a tort theory of recovery may be sustained against a manufacturer of the substance or in some instances against the employer itself on the basis of traditional products liability concepts or various creative theories which seek to avoid the exclusive remedy protections in state workers compensation laws resorting to the tort system with its potential for much higher awards higher attorneys fees and sympathetic jury verdicts appears to be a course that is pursued with increasing frequency reform activities dissatisfaction with the existing workers compensation systems of the states coupled vlth the asbestos disease litigation crisis which has materialized has genarated considerable activity in the past year the most prominent of these efforts are as follows o in  and again in  congressman george miller d calif introduced legislation to create a federally administered occupational disease compensation program funded by employers and to some extent by product manufacturers this legislation which focused on asbestos and radon daughters but could easily be expanded to other substances is now dormant but is not abandoned o in june  the crum and forster insurance company issued a set of comprehensive proposals to reform state workers compensation programs cma  o the insurant industry trade associations together with state workers compensation program administrators are now involved in an effort to propose comprehensive system reform o the aflcto industrial union department has assumed an active role in pursuing broadbased reforms and favors a federalized benefit system and continued access to the tort system o the us chamber of commerce has announced its support for reform of state workers compensation systems o the business round table is commissioning studies of workplace disease reform funding and mechanisms for determining occupational causation of disease o a number of asbestos manufacturers have drafted legislation to create a supplemental federally administered compensation program for asbestos disease victims the proposal has no congressional sponsorship at this time o the kasten bill s which would establish mandatory federal standards for product liability suits proposes to integrate workers compensation and tort remedies cmas public compensation task group has monitored all of these activities and had undertaken an independent investigation of the matters at issue from the prospective of the chemical manufacturing industry it appears that there are substantial industry interests at stake and that those interests are focused primarily on tha increasing spillover of workplace disease claims into the tort system a better integration of tha two systems and more rational mathods for distributing workplace disease liabilities are objectives which merit the careful attention of the industry the obligation to promote the equitable compensation of chemical industry workers afflicted by occupational disease and the prevention of disease are also identified as areas of substantial interest however these aspects of the universe of workpiece disease concerns cannot be addressed apart from the interests of other involved groups in addressing the larger context the committee has identified  general target principles to aid in the evaluation of tvolving workers compensation reform proposals target principles and objectives for workers compensation reform v prevention if occupational disease compensation reform proceeds the reforms agreed upon should actively promote disease prevention and involve employers and employees in prevention initiatives federalization the creation of a new federal occupational disease compensation system is not warranted delivery system occupational disease victims should be equitably compensated within existing state workers compensation systems exclusive remedy workers compensation must be the exclusive remedy for disability or death caused by workplace disease a workers compensation claim must be pursued prior to any effort to seek tort recovery against a third party and that recovery should be reduced by the current value of workers compensation benefits including medical care benefits employers subrogation rights and thirdparty rights  to contribution or indemnity should be abolished workers compensation reform should be consistent and integrated with product liability reforms endorsed by the chemical industry it is appropriate to explore proposed mechanisms to eliminate tort suits altogether in workplace disease claims through manufacturer participation in workers compensation benefit programs eligibility disability or death attributable to an occupational disease should be compensated but eligibility decisions must be based upon established and uniform scientific standards with sufficient flexibility co encompass the extraordinary case causation occupational causation should be determined by occupational disease experts using established uniform scientific criteria davalopcd by scientists in light of the best information available presumptions and similar arbitrary legal devices are incompatible with evolving sciencebased standards and are inappropriate multiple causation a disease traced to multiple causes is not compensated unless its occupational origins are medically significant statute of limitations a claim should be filed within one year from the date of actual or imputed discovery that an occupational disease has been manifested or within one year from death due to an occupational disease notice and definitional limitations arbitrary notice of claim requirements and unscientific or unfair definitional limitations which preclude recovery in occupational disease claims should be repealed disabilitydeath an employer should be liable for disability compensation only to the extent that the disability is caused by occupational factors death benefits are appropriate only if death was significantly related to or materially caused by occupational disease disability and death inquiries are properly made by medical experts benefits cash benefits paid should be computed in light of actual wages lost subject to statutory maxima and minima in latent disease cases benefits should not be unreasonably low solely because the last exposure occurred years earlier medical care should be available without arbitrary restriction retirees disease compensation benefits are properly reduced only by social security old age benefits liability disease compensation benefits are properly paid by the last employer exposing the worker to a hazardous substance or condition funding benefits liabilities must be insurable through existing workers compensation insurance mechanisms retroactivity occupational disease compensation system reforms should be prospective however any retroactive application of reforms must carry back exclusive remedy protections if benefit obligations are extended to cover past incidences of disease alternatives and options under review at this time there is no apparent need to support or propose substantial changes in the occupational disease compensation systems of the states current recommended options are a o take no action to change existing systems o support modest state system reforms in statutes of limitations medical causation etc o continue to monitor ongoing efforts pursued by others develop and refine cma positions and alternatives o oppose federal involvement in occupational disease reform if more extensive occupational disease reform proposals gain momentum and there is a likelihood chat some will in the next year or so the development and consideration of creative alternatives may be essential to a realization of chemical industry objectives a number of promising alternatives and options have surfaced within the committee and are the subject of continuing discussion these include cma   o a proposal to combine a disease prevention and health surveillance system with traditional state workers compensation programs through a scries of economic incentives and disincentives which are designed to encourage employer and employee participation in disease prevention initiatives to reward employee participation with increased benefits and to justify employer participation with improved protections from tort suit other benefits which might accrue in this approach include lover transaction costs better medical records compiled by employerselected medical specialists for use if disease occurs and an increased likelihood of early detection prompt treatment and a return of the worker to gainful employment o proposals which may facilitate the integration of all workers compensation and tort liabilities which may arise out of occupational exposures to hazardous substances with a view toward limiting chemical manufacturing industry liabilities arising from workplace disease o proposals to seek federal health agency participation in the development of medical standards for use in claims action o approve the recommendation to amend cercta section i to provide for more site specific health studies and medical monitoring o review other options for waste site compensation and principles for workplace disease compensation cma v cma  exhibit f report

reduction provisions of hr  the federal boat safety act and the focus for the senates deficit reduction budget package a housesenate conference on the tax provisions in hr  and those in hr  the omnibus tax legislation which passed the house earlier this year should begin by mid to late may the senate amendment to hr  contains several key provisions that are of great importance to the chemical industry o the administrations foreign sales corporation fsc provisions to provide a gattlegal alternative to replace the domestic inter national sales corporation disc provision of the internal revenue code o a twoyear extension of the moratorium on treasury regulations  that would require allocation of overseas research and development expenses to foreign source income o provisions to modify and to make permanent the research and experimentation tax credit although these provisions would be of greatest benefit to the chemical industry there are other important provisions in this legislation for example both the house and senate bills would impose much tighter control over premature accruals the senate bill clarifies the all events test in present law and would provide generally that no deduction for federal income tax purposes would be allowed until economic performance occurs the senate bill also contains an election to allow a less restrictive method in the case of the reclamation and closing costs of mines and in the disposal of liquid and hazardous wastes from disposal sites other than superfund sites this provision could be of crucial importance to the chemical industry the total fiscal impact of this legislation on the chemical industry is difficult to project however the value of the provisions for the foreign sales corporations the extended moratorium on the  regulations for allocating versus research and development expenses to foreign income and to modify and to make permanent the research and experimentation tax credit are estimated to exceed  billion because of the many provisions in this important legislation that would affect corporate activities cma advised representatives of member companies to review this legislation carefully and to contact house and senate conferees about their concerns cma is working closely with allied trade associations and business groups to urge the housesenate conferees to retain the provisions in the senate bill to establish the foreign sales corporation and to extend the moratorium on the  research and development allocation regulations cma  national economic policies patent term restoration for almost three and a half years cma has participated in a washington business coalition under the leadership of the pharmaceutical manufacturers association pma to support passage of the patent term restoration act this important legislation would extend patent life on products that must undergo prolonged periods of governmentmandated testing and review the organized opposition to this legislation has focused on the impact the legislation would have on the generic drug industry to resolve this opposition and impasse pma earlier this year proposed a twotitle bill that would contain both patent term restoration and abbreviated new drug provisions that would enable generic drug manufacturers to enter the market more easily than under the present system pma reached an agreement in principle on this proposal with congressman henry waxman dca as of may  pma and congressman waxmans staff were unable to reduce this agreement in principle to acceptable legislative language on april  representatives glickman dks and dewine roh introduced hr  the agricultural patent reform act this legis lation would provide patent restoration for pesticides animal drugs and

language can be worked out in this session energy and feedstock suppliest natural gas legislation the house energy and commerce committee reported on april  a natural gas bill hr  designed to put a cap on natural gas prices until  and allow pipelines to escape from contractual obligations major provisions include a freeze on above market prices until january   forced renegotiation of certain highpriced gas and a twoyear ceiling on indefinite price escalators in gas contracts unless the contracts are renegotiated takeorpay obligations are limited to fifty percent of contracted volumes minimum bills between pipelines and distributors are eliminated and a prudency standard for pipelines purchasing gas is established hr  was sponsored by representatives ril and thomas j tauke ria and represents a dramatic turnaround from the earlier subcommittee reported version the objective of the  members supporting hr  was to report a bill quickly without amendments commitments were obtained by the chairman to support the package and all amendments were defeated proponents of cma  decontrol and producingstate democrats have labeled the bill a pipelinebailout and have pointed to the regional economic disparities the legislation would create the bill is similar in many respects to earlier american gas association and citizens labor energy coalition clc supported versions with the bill being reported without amendment commitments may not hold and considerable debate could occur in the rules committee and on the house floor chairman dingell may not be committed to the bill as drafted but he has termed the prospects reasonable for getting a vote from the house on the bill in july the house energy committee report has not been filed and a rule has not yet been requested the rules committee could report the bill in such a way that permits all sides in the controversy an opportunity for amendments or substitute versions the house majority leader does not support the bill as drafted with its recontrol aspects on the other hand the speaker of the house has indicated some support for an even more restrictive version cma together with other user trade associations is strongly opposed to hr  and every effort will be made to prevent passage of the punitive legislation in its present form cma has stated the status quo is preferable to the sharp bill and opposes a rule sending that bill to the house floor producers are even more adamant in their opposition and have indicated that hr  cannot be amended to lessen the negative impact of price caps and freezes the administration has also registered its opposition and predicted that if the bill were enacted new gas production would be discouraged and a serious gas shortage could be created once the current glut is used up energy secretary donald p hodel together with republican members of the house energy and commerce committee is expected to seek changes in the legislation activity in the house is being closely watched by a coalition of senators who are trying to develop a compromise bill senate energy committee chairman james a mcclure rid is working to continue the negotiating process the house reported bill runs counter to many of the principles supported by the senate leadership and the recent proposal under discussion but passage of a house bill could return natural gas legislation to the senate floor a series of quickfix natural gas amendments to unrelated legislation may be attempted in the senate proponents of deregulation could also filibuster any effort to pass a bill similar to the present house version national economic policiest trade remedies legislation the house ways and means committee reported out the trade remedies reform act of  aka the gibbons bill in early april it is expected that the bill will be considered on the house floor under a modified rule which allows only committee approved amendments the bill as reported was essentially the same as the subcommittee version with the only substantive change being the deletion of the section dealing with nonmarket economy imports the senate finance committe has held hearings cma  t  on a bill to address this issue but no markup is currently scheduled the most controversial section of the gibbons bill establishes the authority to impose countervailing duties against imported material manufactured from raw materials priced below export or fair market values this same section of the bill establishes a mechanism to deal with industry targeting by foreign governments and provides a remedy for downstream dumping the administration is opposed to these provisions and attempted unsuccessfully to strike them at the committee markup cma member companies continue to hold very strong opinions on both sides of the issue causing the cma executive committee to take no position on the gibbons bill while no floor action is currently planned on the gibbons bill in the house it is likely that the bill will come to the floor for action in june and will pass the house a senate counterpart still does not exist if the bill were to pass both houses of congress there is widespread belief that the president would veto it cma has no position on the gibbons bill but continues to explore possible revisions to the trade remedy laws focusing on sections    and  of the trade act national

scheduled to continue on may   and possibly beyond that the chances of reporting out a bill are uncertain due to considerable controversy debate continues over the federal governments proper role in a petroleum shortfall other issues of concern include preemption of state laws and antitrust and conflict of interest exemptions for energy companies and executives called to government service during an energy emergency many amendments are being prepared and are expected to include standby federal oil price and allocation controls and emergency financial aid to the poor and others likely to suffer during an oil shortage the administration has suggested changes to the mcclure bill in support of appropriate legislation without price and allocation authority in  president reagan vetoed a standby petroleum allocation bill cma supports the basic free market approach of the mcclure bill and several parts of the bradley bill the cma viewpoint is however that social programs for the economically disadvantaged should not be mixed with national energy policy the durenberger bill is not supported by the cma energy committee commercial production of chemicals tsca in the senate david durenbergers subcommittee staff continues drafting a tsca amendments package which will becirculated piecemeal as cma  staff drafts the first piece should be available in the next month and we expect unfriendly proposed changes in the following areas  the section  test rule process perceived as too slow and unwieldy under present procedures  a pmn test data requirement on a rebuttable presumption basis for new chemicals  an attempt to reduce claims for confidential business information alleged to be excessive under present law and  some means of getting cpa to make greater use of section  control actions on existing chemicals in response to these proposals we have shared with senate staff the following concepts o negotiated testing agreements have improved the section  process and ought to be recognized in the law o a hazard evaluation statement to be included in a pmn provide greater assurances as to the adequacy of the pmn review in essence the statement would evaluate the potential human health and environmental effects for each new substance under anticipated conditions of manufacture use and exposure o industry be given more time to deal with confidentiality problems through an educational process designed to limit claims to only that information truly confidential cma is working with other trade associations in developing positions to be used at the appropriate time to improve the outcome of senate and house efforts to amend tsca in the house mr florios bill to amend tsca hr  is in a holding pattern pending developments on superfund reauthorization occupational safety and health disease compensation the senate labor subcosraittee hearing april  focused on occupational disease in general and asbestos in particular the hearing was the first of a series that will be continuing through the months of may and june senator kennedy as expected called industryafailure to protect workers from asbestos and other deadly substances a public health tragedy the usual grim statistics were reported by a colleague of dr selicoffs such as the  asbestosrelated deaths to date and he predicted    deaths per year from  to the year  finally a rand study reports that asbestos victims receive only  of the dollars paid out while  goes for legal expenses noteworthy however was the way in which chairman don nickles rok framed the issue by asking first is there a national asbestos crisis and second if so what should be done about it balance was brought to the hearing which cast some doubt on the assumption that asbestos is a national crisis two eminent medical research doctors made a strong case for the critical need for sound medicalscientifie criteria as a basis fo compensating asbestos victims fred baron a leading attorney for asbestos victims and active in the trial lawyers association conceded there is no current litigation crisis and our tort system has evolved rapidly and responsibily to deal with asbestos victims he blames insurance companies cma   as the primary causa of problems but says that may soon be solved through the wellington groups proposed solution he concluded by saying x believe it would be unwise at this time to consider a legislative restructuring of the benefit delivery mechanism now in effect while chairman nickles hearing initially focused on asbestos we are watching closely for any broadening to other substancesdiseases in particular we are watching senator quayles effort to find a sponsor for the asbestos manufaeturersusers coalition cec bill limited to asbestos and an as yet unseen proposal by senator kennedy not limited to asbestos congressman millers bill hr  remains status quo in the house old waste sitescercla representative james florio dnj has recently introduced his third edition of superfund reauthorization legislation hr  florios subcommitteewill markup the bill on may  and report it to the full committee the florio bill is still unacceptable but has a few changes such as reauthorization for five years an amendment to cercla no administrative fund for victims compensation but a federal cause of action and an attempt to codify existing case law on the issue of joint and several liability the legislation has been cosponsored by at least  members of the house including a few influential house democratic committee chairmen and key house republicans house speaker tip oneill has told the democrats he wants the superfund work completed in the committees and ready for floor vote the beginning of august oneill has told the democratic house to force this issue into the national limelight to make it a presidential election issue against president reagan and the republicans representative robert roe dnj has begun superfund hearings in his water resources subcommittee of the public works and transportation committee roe who is a cosponsor of florios bill will not resume the superfund hearings until mid june and cma will testify at these hearings the other house committee with jurisdiction over superfund the ways and means committee will not begin hearings until the second or third week of june cma continues to pursue a very aggressive lobbying effort aimed at the key members of these three house committees the cma grassroots effort is also very active back in the home districts of the key members of these committees cma is working on the issues of funding level and mechanism joint and several liability how clean is clean victims compensation plus other key issues senator robert stafford rvt has begun the senate reauthorization hearings in the senate environment and public works committee cma testified on may  and mr edwin holmer president of exxon chemical corporation and chairman of cmas board of directors presented the industrys superfund positions of interest to members of the committee were our positions on cma  r i o the annual laval of funding which the superfund needs and epa can administer o joint and several liability o the economic impact of a substantial increase in the feedstock tax o the viability of a wasteend tax o taxing chemical feedstock imports and o victims compensation stafford will introduce a superfund bill after he completes his may hearings it is possible he may have additional hearings on the legislation in june resource conservation amd recovery act rcra senate consideration of the rcra reauthorization bill s  has been postponed perhaps until after the congressional memorial day recess since the bill was originally reported from the environment and public works committee a number of controversial amendments have surfaced which would requir considerable time to debate on the senate floor with the shortened congressional calendar due to the upcoming democratic and republican conventions the senate leadership apparently is unwilling to dedicate several days to the rcra reauthorization bill the more controversial amendments which have delayed consideration of s  include senator durenbergers leaking underground storage tank lust amendment and the questions of whether or not mining wastes are subject to rcra regulations there are some    other amendments to the bill which together would require substantial time to consider cmas efforts continue to be geared toward adoption of a reasonable surface impoundment amendment the latest draft surface impoundment amendment encompasses most of the major provisions endorsed by cma however equalization ponds or ponds in which no treatment is occuring would not be exempted from the double liner requirement cma has approached the senate environment and public works committee staff with proposed language to exempt equalization ponds if the contamination could be contained however it does not appear as though these ponds will be covered in the final version of the committee surface impoundment amendment the amendment to be offered by senators cranston dca and humphrey rnh to require that up to  million of the superfund is to perform health studies of populations surrounding landfills and surface impoundments continues to be reviewed by cmas technical staff cma will be discussing with the senators the suggested changes in their amendment should they be deemed necessary cma   clean water act the housepublic act amendments on may chairman james howard subcommittee on may  works and transportation committee passed clean water  the bill hr  was introduced by committee dnj last summer amended in the water resources and the cull committee on may  hr  contains few significant improvements over the existing clean water act for the chemical industry the best available technology bat compliance date extension was included a bat study provision has been substituted for the bat modification provision which cma originally recommended the pretreatment study provision in the bill could yield good information but not quick enough to support the local pretreatment program there are several adverse amendments in the committeepassed bill including postbat requirements epa administrative civil penalties authority and felony sanctions cmas technical and government relations clean water act task groups provided the house subcommittee and members and staffs with language which reflected cma priorities for improvement in the bill however chairman howard with the cooperation of subcommittee chairman robert roe dnj basically held the line on his bill house floor action on hr  depends upon the limited time remaining on the house calendar in the senate the committee approved bills s  and s  providing for clean water act amendments could be considered anytime the passage of a house committee bill may provide impetus for senate floor debate cma continues to support an amendment to s  allowing local pretreatment programs which senator symms rid is prepared to offer safe drinking water act sdwa senator durenbergers bill s  to reauthorize the safe drinking water act was introduced on may  the senate subcommittee on toxic substances and environmental oversights held a one day hearing on may  cma will testify sometime in early june senator durenbergers bill appears to be a substantial improvement over the house version of the safe drinking water act hr  the senate bill does not change the definition of a drinking water source nor does the bill substantially restrict the use of underground injection wells as does the house bill although the bill contains language in its goals and policy section which refers to the protection of groundwater sources  from contamination there are no broad groundwater provisions in the bill cma believes the groundwater issue should be separate from any safe drinking water act legislation an area of concern with the senate bill is the absence of cost considerations in determining feasible technology it is possible that s  will be reported from the committee on environment and public works and maybe considered by the full senate sometime this summer in the house congressman waxman chairman of the subcommittee on health of the energy and commerce committee has given no cma  indication that ha will schadula hearings for hr  in tha foreseeable future clean air act on may  the house health and environment subcommittee considered the hazardous air pollutant sections of hr  this bill was introduced by subcommittee chairman henry waxman dca congressman john dingell dmi chairman of the full energy and commerce committee offered a positive substitute for the onerous hazardous air pollutant provisions of hr  the subconsaittee can vote on the dingell substitute whenever waxman reconvenes the subcommittee hr  consists of hazardous air pollutant provisions only since may  when the acid rain provisions which industry opposed werevoted out in subcommittee cma and the interindustry group on section  of the clean air act hazardous pollutants are working to win at least one vote necessary for approval of the dingell substitute cma also is developing materials to assist in any full committee consideration of hazardous air pollutants in addition cma and industry continues to urge that constructive amendments on psd and nonattainment for example be included in any clean air bill that moves in the house this year in the senate the committee report to accompany the comprehensive clean air bill s  was issued on may  s  now appears on the senate calendar for floor debate lack of consensus among the full senate on acid rain control such as s  contains and lack of house progress toward a comprehensive bill explain senate inaction at present state level communication and coordination state legislative activity for the balance of the year some states will be addressing issues of great importance to our industry in pennsylvania and michigan the industry is trying to work out a compromise on right to know new jersey and massachusetts are working on the public compensation issue and louisiana is promoting a large number of hazardous waste proposals tha cics industry personnel and cma will continue to work on these issues there has been some restructuring and strengthening of some of the existing cics along with the hiring of experienced legislative counsel in some states many organizations have been extremely successful with their legislative activities the upcoming annual matting of the national conference of stata legislatures will prasant discussions on environmental conflict managamant worker right to know groundwater superfund and public compensation the national governors associations annual meeting will include soma discussions on acid rain groundwater and toxics integration state affairs committee programs underway members of the environmental task group will be participating in an air toxics risk assessment workshop sponsored by the northeast states for coordinated air use management nescaum the purpose of the meeting is to illustrate how toxic air contaminant risk evaluation processes are employed topics will include toxicological concepts review of risk assessment models risk assessment case studies and risk management practices the hazardous materials transportation task group participated in the annual conference of the hazardous materials advisory council hmac which was held in arlington virginia the conference was attended by federal and state regulatory officials state legislators and members of industry discussion centered on restrictions on hazardous materials transportation and cooperative efforts to find solutions key issue superfund and hazardous waste although a number of state legislatures have already adjourned some states continue to be active in the superfund and hazardous waste area amendments have been introduced to the new jersey spill compensation and control act to change the existing front end tax to a waste end disposal tax other favorable changes include the followingt o broadening the base of taxpayers from approximately  to  firms o providing for exemptions from the proposed new tax for beneficially reused or recycled material o providing companies which transport hazardous waste to another state which levies a disposal tax with a  credit on the new jersey tax amount in alabama hazardous waste legislation would allow no extension or changes in disposal techniques or sites without legislative approval this would also apply to industries who dispose onsite a separate bill would allow onsite inspectors at all hazardous waste sites who would be funded through fees on industry cma  a substitute bill has been introduced in michigan to replace legislation which would have required all handlers of hazardous waste and material in underground tanks to carry liability insurance claims could have been made by people exposed to the hazardous waste the new legislation as modified is much more acceptable to industry it is anticipated that this bill will pass before the july recess key issue right to know although the briefing schedule has now been finalized for the litigation on the federal hazard communication standard no decision is expected before next year plans are also moving forward under the auspices of the new jersey state chamber of commerce to challenge the new jersey state right to know law in the near future in other states the deadlock in the michigan senate labor committee continues over the competing labor and industry right to know bills while negotiations are continuing no movement of the labor bill is foreseen at this time a house floor vote is expected in pennsylvania in late may on an industry backed bipartisan amendment to the onerous bill which has passed out of committee the chances of the industry provisions being accepted have increased significantly in recent months t the governor has signed legislation in iowa and another bill in maryland is expected to be signed in the near future neither of these proposals will have a significant adverse impact on the chemical industry other legislative activity is ongoing in louisiana illinois delaware rhode island and florida the louisiana and florida bills are the most significant regulatory activity is still pending on onerous statutes in new jersey massachusetts and illinois j key issue i public compensation the state public compensation situation has stabilized during the past month new jersey remains the only major threat to pass legislation this year however as more time passes before the hearing process begins the likelihood for passage this session diminishes significantly in other states the study commission in massachusetts continues to meet and take testimony weekly a report is expected before the end of the year with serious discussions of legislation very likely in  activity in new york is focused on changing the existing statute of limitations for tort claims from the present restrictive rule to the more liberal and generally accepted discovery rule other states with the potential for activity this year are california and illinois l i j  i cma  key issue air development of the massachusetts air toxic program is nearing completion a chemical health effects methodology chem provides for the ranking of chemicals based on the severity of potential health effects with regulations and standards adopted for those substances which are ranked highest on the list the final result of this methodology could be an enforceable ambient emissions limit for a given air toxic the state regulatory agency has generated possible ambient numbers for  of  chemicals identified as potential massachusetts air toxics industry members feel that a more complete description is needed on how cancer potency is derived and there is a need to develop a system which allows for the review of new data the air toxics program is scheduled for completion by july of this year maine will begin to develop an air toxics program sometime this summer it is anticipated that the program will focus on modeling rather than ambient monitoring key issue water florida has adopted regulations described as the toughest in the country to insure safe drinking water for the ten million people served by community wells in the state because no guidelines have been set by the environmental protection agency the state relied heavily on the findings of experts in the toxicological field the rules impose standards on eight contaminants and require monitoring of  other toxins they require that all water systems serving more than  customers be tested every three years for traces of vinyl chloride and benzene known carcinogens as well as five other volatile organic chemicals suspected of causing cancer in humans key issue chronic health activity in the chronic health area at the state level continues to increase legislation which has been introduced in california would create a center for disease control to identify and research diseases caused by environmental agents michigans bill if passed would require the department of public health to maintain a cancer registry to aid in complete epidemiologic surveys of cancer related diseases and to apply appropriate preventive and control measures a number of other states including massachusetts minnesota new jersey and new york have introduced similar legislation key issue transportation transportation legislation has been introduced in pennsylvania would would place additional requirements and restrictions on many industry shippers industrys concerns with the bill include the following o transporters remain under the right to know licensing requirements and must obtain a license for hazardous chemicals handled on quantities greater than  pounds or  gallons cma  o hazardous materials transporter with no origin or destination in the city may not leave the interstate highway this appears to preclude stops for repairs meals and change of drivers o the fire commissioner is directed to write regulations reasonably restricting the transport of hazardous chemicals o shippers and receivers are required under penalty of law to notify suppliers and transporters with whom they do business about requirements the pennsylvania chemical industry council has been very active on this issue and will be the coordinating mechanism for future action on this bill as it becomes

to the board of directors september   executive summary major accomplishments the environmental management conittaes  year van once again full diversified and productive the committee effectively and successfully managed environental matter before regulatory agencies congress federal courts and the public in addition the wc is working closely with the state affairs committee to address evolving aate environmental issues a description of the imcs major accomplishments is set forth in qiapter z a swaary of these accomplishments includes  o the mc in conjunction with the government relations committee has actively advocated reauthorisation and appropriate amendment of the full spectrum of enviroimmntal legislation  superfund resource conservation and recovery act rcra the safa drinking water act clean air act and clean water act the end result of the  efforts was a comprehensive amendment of rcra cma efforts resulted in significant modifications to the rcra amandsents to make several require ments more palatable we hevei  proposed sound legisla tive alternatives  promoted aendaents that assure costeffective requirements and  have opposed amendments that impose unjustified restraints on industry operation and potential growth or those that offer little or no commensurate environmental benefits at this time there is a real likelihood that mendments to the clean water act superfund and the safe drinking water act will be enacted this year o one of the key elements of cmas haxardous waste management program is to establish industry trends in member company hazardous waste disposal practices to achieve this objec tive the oic conducted for the third year a survey of waste disposal practices for  and is managing a similar survey for  the three year survey results show very favorable disposal practice trends the survey results have proven to be a vary valuable element in otas superfund legislative and communications progrms and as a part of the full spectrum of solid waste advocacy activities o during the past year the rapidly escalating issue of air toxics has taken up an increased level of activity and has great significance to the dic and the industry in the past year the img managed a survey requested by congressman dingell on monitoring and detection systems for chemicals and emergency respons systems at chenieel industry plants in a cma  rwlated uptcti the emc has established an ad hoe group to davalop a comprehensive work plan for air toxics although wa ara still in tha initial phasas of this activity cmas efforts hava already begun to obtain results wa ware prepared to address in a constructive yat forceful nature tha first of what could be a series of legislative proposals on air toxics enissions this activity will be one of tha critical issues cmaimc will be addressing in the next few years o a second area of increased activity is in the groundwater area the emc has had in place for the past year an ad hoc groundwater coordinating coesaittaa to assure overall coordina tion of cma ccsmittee activities in implementing cmas groundwater work plan the implementation of the work plan is necessary to address groundwater related issues at both the state and federal level cmas activities have been effective in assuring that the reauthorization of the safe drinking water act does not became the vehicle for addressing groundwater issues cma is viewed by members of congress and zpa as being in the forefront on groundwater matters and is looked to by other industry groups to play a leadership role o cma continues to promote a reasonable implementation of the existing and recently mended pcra hazardous waste require ments one of the key emc activities was to conduct three educational seminars on the new rcm amewhants and compliance with pcra substantive and procedural requirements the seminars were held in conjunction with the council of chemical associations on the regulatory issues cma efforts have

requirements in light of the new ac pa regulatory requirements we anticipate a vary high level of activity of the acaa regulations task group in addressing the new imple menting regulations to assure that they are needed technically characteristics and transport of contaminants ebr states where groundwater quantity is a concern this may not be separable from the quality issue states may choose to regulate the withdrawal of groundwater as may be appropriate to protect groundwater quality as part of its state groundwater quality protection program cma does not see a federal role in state evaluation of water quality impacts of withdrawal programs and statutes under some circumstances such as in vulnerable hydrogeological areas state or local governments may choose to implement planning of the use of the land for future activities overlying the aquifer or the recharge zone to assure protection of groundwater quality land use and soils information should be used in conjunction with aquifer mapping to develop appropriate land use management decisions such controls may include zoning restrictions requirements for septic tank placement requirements for the siting of new facilities where potential adverse impacts from groundwater contamination are especially significant restrictions on other activities related to land use that may potentially affect groundwater quality cma  t tha federal government should continue to usist states in the development guidance and technical assistance lating land uses hydrogeology and soils with potential groundwater impacts kill also assist stats and local government in making land use decisions where necessary cma believes the federal government should not involve itself in land use decisions f quifar mapping and soils information where point source discharges to groundwater are not currently permitted under existing regulations states may choose to incorporate a permit system under their groundwater quality protection progrms to

presented to the board op directors op the chemical manufacturers association gary s furman chairman september   cma  introduction relative to other cma issues energy is not a major concern at this time crude oil prices have dropped fuel oil prices have remained stable natural gas prices have declined the supply of oil gas coal and electricity is not a current problem under this type of environment the energy committe charter to ensure equal access at competitive prices to supplies of feedstocks and energy moves in the direction of stewardship the meeting schedule has been reduced and we have worked to establish energyoriented ad hoc coalitions as a cost effective means of promoting cma energy positions despite this apparently benign energy environment issues remain that can impact the chemical industry now and in the future  comprehensive gas legislation is unlikely this year but some form of gas legislation may come up as an amendment  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has become the battleground for key gas issues not requiring legislation such as transportation pricing access to supply and establishment of an interstate competitive gas market  the governments search for additional revenue continues thus the possibility of new energy taxes  efforts are under way to establish protectionist trade barriers for refined petroleum products  traditional costbased pricing of electricity is being further challenged before the ferc in the proposed rule making for electricity  increased government energy data collection is likely i cma   t

technical issues which includes electricity energy conservation and government reporting f  natural gas issues f in the fourth quarter of  cma successfully opposed congressional legislation to reregulate natural gas this marked the last serious legislative effort in natural gas and no comprehensive gas legislation is likely this year there is however always the risk of fragmented natural gas legislation as amendments to other bills since deregulation  january   of approximately  of wellhead gas pricing under the natural gas policy act the battleground for gas has shifted to the federal energy regulatory commission  i ferc because of the quasilegal atmosphere and the associated high cost cma established procedures for cooperative efforts with other industrial gas consumer groups involving the shared use of outside legal counsel in responding to a broad public inquiry by the federal en rgy regulatory commission on natural gas transmission and pipeline ratemaking the ferc will decide this matter i in the fourth quarter of this year objectives for    the cma will continue to advocate legislation which will bring about a free market and enhanced supply ie deregulation of wellhead ceiling prices and removal of all market restraints the major effort however will b directed to ferc regulatory reform to enhance natural gas market competition which by its nature is dependent upon equal access and transportation of natural gas supplies stake assurance of natural gas as a source of energy and feedstocks on a competitive price basis foster associates a

th ir dedication to meet the objectives set by the    energy committee cma  report of the engineering advisory committee to the cma board of directors september to  good morning im delighted to have this opportunity to talk a little bit about the engineering advisory committee your program book contains our formal report and i dont intend to go over that in detail i will use one or two specific examples from that report to illustrate some points i would like to make and of course will do my best to answer any questions it engenders  or questions arising from anything else for that matter but i would like to editorialize a bit upon the bare listing of specific activities to leave with you the following ideas first eacs major role namely that of dealing with codes and standards is an advocacy activity although it is not the type of ad vocacy you will read about very often on the front page of the new york times and it may or may not be dealingwith a government entity it is nevertheless an advocacy not dissimilar to cmas main thrusts the second important thought is that cma is uniquely positioned to perform that advocacy in discussing this point id like to take you through the criteria eac uses in selecting the tasks where that advocacy is an essential element and lead you to the final thought namely that the eac activities have a high payout for a very modest expenditure to those who are not close to standards activities it might seem that setting standards should be a straightforward technical job or pure science if you will about as controversial as      that the only problem should be to arrive at the best technical solution to which all rational experts would readily subscribe oh would that it were so it is perhaps appropriate to spend just a few minutes to refresh our memories on the general framework of the standards system in the us standards are voluntary or consensus although in many in stances one or more governmental jurisdictions give them the force of law after they are prepared  the national electric code is a classic ex ample as a voluntary standard it represents good engineering practice but all or parts of it have also been enacted into law by virtually every local state and federal governmental body involved with the regulation of either construction or personal safetyfrom local building codes to osha the umbrella organization for the voluntary standards system is the american national standards institute known as ansi for short ansi does not write any standards what it does do is oversee the consensus process when   deternrlnes there has been a reasonable opportunity for all interested parties to voice a contribution and that all valid objec cma   tions have been either resolved or adjudicated it will adopt the document as an ansi standard there are perhaps  or  thousand of such ansi standards of these i would guess that something in the range of  to  thousand are of direct or indirect interest to the chemical in dustry in addition there are many standards of interest that have never gone through the ansification process just to name one the standard of the tubular exchanger manufacturers association or tema which forms the backbone for most of the industrys shell and tube heat exchanger purchases remains as a manufacturers agreement not ansi document how then do standards get into the ansi system there are several acceptable procedures the three most comnon are  consensus conmittee  accredited organization or  canvass the consensus conmittee approach was originally predominant in the ansi system in using this path an adhoc committee is convened inherently containing consensus that is the conmittee members are carefully selected to represent parties of interestclassically manufacturers users techni cal experts the public and any special interests the committees out put is subjected to public comment and when all negative conments have been resolved the document is adopted as a standard many of our basic process industry engineering standards were developed in this fashion for example b process piping bflanges  ays pumps etc however this mode is gradually shifting over to other forms major in put to the content of such standards must come primarily from parti cipating on the working conmittee at the moment cmaeac has only four representatives to such conmittees so you can see we have been highly selective over the years member company direct participation has been high in such activities and still forms the backbone of chemical industry input it is only where member company direct participation cannot accomplish the goals that cma participation is undertaken most often this occurs when only organizations not individuals or companies are admitted to membership ill say more about this subject a little later the second procedure recognized by ansi is that of the ac credited organization here ansi certifies that the procedures of the sponsoring organization provide for achieving consensus essential elements include public access to the work and requires broad based com mittee participation notification requirements rights of appeal recordkeeping and mechanisms to resolve any conflict many of our most used standards are developed this way including the asme boiler and pressure vessel code and our favorite example  the national electric code which is under the aegis of the national fire protection association cma  in many aspects it is difficult to perceive the differences between the consensus coumittee and the accredited organization work on the nec for example is carried out by  codemaking panels each of about  members plus an equal number of alternates cmaeac partici pates on the  panels which most closely affect the chemical industry  total representatives provided by member companies at member company expense code panel composition includes representation from equipment manufacturers government officials trade unions technical societies the building industry contractors consumer advocates metal industries insulation manufacturers other trade associations nema btc vendors the utility industry and probably others i missed as i skinmed the list the motivations in such a diverse group obviously differ there are many opportunities for honest differences of technical opinion based on the diverse perspectives represented  that after all is what the consensus system is all about but it is also possible for pet ideas or even special interests to be pressed beyond the point of justification just one example at the last revision of the nec certain interests sought to include a requirement for a motor disconnect switch physically at each motor  offering as justification the safety of persons working on the motor for most users this is a matter of in difference not so in the process industries where such a local switch would normally have to be explosion proof it is cmas position that current tag and lockout procedures on remote disconnect devices provide demonstrably adequate protection and that the proposal creates greater safety hazards than the one it is intended to correct if the proposal were adopted we estimated the cost to cma member companies at  msyr based on the then current rate of new construction although the amount of new construction varies we observe that the normal time interval between adoption of a standard for safety applicable only to new con struction and the first voice of regulation suggesting retrofit is generally measured in milliseconds in this case no estimate of retro fit cost has been made one feature of the ansi system intended to minimize obsoles cence is that each standard must be revised or reaffirmed within a  year interval the proposal on motor disconnects was turned back at the working conmlttee level for both the  and  versions of the nec current activities are aimed at the  nec once again the proposal has failed sufficient committee support for adoption tie vote how ever this time appeal has brought it forth for public comnent prepara tory to a floor fight at the nfpa convention the immediate task at hand is to encourage sufficient public conment to lay the foundation for a successful floor fight if it is carried that far the electrical task group is currently organizing such a campaign among member companies and other sympathizers the nfpa membership assembled in convention is the cma  court of ultimate appeal in so far as technical content of the nec is concerned although members of the nfpa are obviously interested in safety only a small percentage will be technically versed in matters electrical i think the parallels with other forms of advocacy are obvious it is also obvious that a single decision does not make a threat go away like bad pennies these things keep coming back and back in addition to the consensus committee and accredited organi zation modes of adoption there is a third in frequent use  the canvass method here the document is prepared by nonrepresentative means then submitted for public comment and acceptance all negatives must be re solved typical organizations using this approach include the under writers laboratories the api and our old friends the national board of boiler and pressure vessel inspectors most of the activities from this source with the exception of the national board are less demanding on the committee per se but do impact on cma staff continued partici pation however is a necessary prerequisite to our credibility when claiming to represent the chemical manufacturing industry in other matters let me turn away from the ansi tutorial to the question of how eac selects its tasks in a very few cases only organizations such as cma representing identifiable blocks of interest will have access here obviously if it is worth doing cma should do it the option is absten tion there are only seven official cma representatives plus two alter nates in such categories i mentioned before that the major standards effort comes from direct member company participation rather than cma participation eac does attempt to track participation in areas of significant interest and maintain an informal liaison with member company reps this contributes to a broader coverage and less redundant effort where the tracking indicates a lack of coverage in an area of interest we try to encourage some member company to fill the gap it was this gap identification effort that some years ago spotted the fact that there was no user industry participation on the nec panels in this case the task was so complex that a more formal response was judged to be needed and a coordinated effort was mounted which has been highly effective the bulk of the effort is still provided directly by member company volunteers but without the coordination available only through cma the total industry cost to participate would have been much higher and is unlikely to have been as effective  companies  member each on tg  reps to nec the strength of a well thought out unified industry position has been amply demonstrated cma  just because  standard is used by the chemical industry does not make it an issue the eac does not worry about nor deal with the dimensions of bolt threads we dont care much about flanges so long as the flange we will buy next month will mate with the one we bought last month but if there is an effort at significant change as with the metrication thrust of a few years ago even flange dimensions can become a key issue these crises come and go the eac relies primarily on its informal liaison with member company representatives as well as its own membership to surface the problem areas which are appropriate for cma attention appropriateness is measured by potential impact on the industry and whether cma is needed as opposed to member company rep handling the matter with some support the net result is the very selective direct involvement by the eac mentioned before but a much wider behindthescenes impact with both indirect and direct savings out of proportion to the modest budget i dont want to leave you with the impression that looking at a few standards represents the sum total of eac activities response to pertinent regulation and legislation is a clear mandate for example this year we had expected two osha proposals on electric safety topics we were not disappointed when they didnt issue  but they will be one of our concerns growing out of several years of arm wrestling with the national board of boiler and pressure vessel inspectors and the relatively satisfactory outcome at the national level is that the arena will shift to the state level the national board is after all composed entirely of senior state level appointees and the state capitals are their natural habitat the eac has been working with state affairs  vision to attempt to work out an effective early warning system that will be both comprehensive and cost effective a necessary adjunct will be the necessary backup and support to the local cic if and as required the eac has for a number of years sponsored a computer user forum at two year intervals these educational sessions in a rapidly moving technology have been extremely well received and are generally selfsupporting this year in partial response to the bhopal incident the eac undertook to conduct a similar forum on inspection and maintenance and instructed a newly formed task group to focus on safety through inspec tion and maintenance procedures and techniques this group will be holding its third meeting next week and seems well on the way to creating an informative and constructive session cma   for the coining year we plan to continue the programs already in place especially those related to the nec and the two forums planned we need to continue to strive for a comprehensive and cost effective mechanism for dealing with state level regulation of pressure equipment in preparation for the storm of regulatory legislation that in the wake of bhopal and later incidents now seems in evitable we need to position the eac to support the association most effectively some parts of this can and will be undertaken at eac initiativefor example an in creased interaction with and support to the safety and health committee seems appropriate but the eac by the nature of the subjects it deals with and the normal working assignments of its members is essentially a reactive not a proactive group therefore the majority of issues needing attention will necessarily flow from the association to the eac for supporting contribution andor prime responsibility thank you for your time and attention in this expurgated version of eac activities i hope ive left you with some key thoughts  e the whole participation in standards activities is closely akin to more obvious advocacy initiatives e by careful selection of topics and leveraging returns a hefty payout on funds expended the eac plays a coordlnative role not replaceable by another organization or the member companies acting individually the eac and finally a that the eac can and will be responsive to the associations needs in the coming times thank you cma cma  sound and costeffective o superfund and its implementation

that as an association vs develop forvarding thinking policies that allow ths industry to get ia front on an issue so that vs end up managing the issue rather than the issue managing our limited resources we have made progress in how we are viewed by te public congress and da in that vs are considered a constructive factor on key eaviromental issues eg superfund acm surface water if the chemical industry is going to continue to be successful in its advocacy before spa and congress it is asential more than ever that vs not only develop proactive positions but provide spa and congress the necessary alternatives ndor supporting data in this regard all levels of da and congressional staffs continue to request industry data andor information as part of the congressional and regulatory development process a meaningful response by industry will require significant member company and staff resources if we want to effectively edvocate positions before da we must continue to make this resource camitaent such efforts will result in limited regulations andor mrs costeffective regulations for the chemical industry that also  will provide a substantially improved environment the nc will be challenged during the next year to develop proectlve positions to rsspond to the da and to adequately support legislative and judicial issues as they arise in this regard the me will need company comitments of adequate resources to address new regulatory and legislative initiatives concerning groundwater air toxics acm wendsents implementation in addition we will need to support oia activities concerning possible wendments to the clean air act and development of a new piece of groundwater legislation there will also be extensive regulatory activities to address on implementation of ell environmental statutes this activity also includes possible litigation related to implementation of the clean water act clean air act acm safe drinking water act end superfuad many environmental issues addressed at the federal level will become ore important at the state level and poaslbly at the international level the mc will therefore be ia e continuous process of sotting priorities and concentrating our resources where they will have the fastest likelihood of positive impact for the chemical industry cma cma  exhibit  report to cma board of directors gf fort monsanto company chairman cma state affairs committee september  s good morning  i am garth fort from monsanto my purpose today to report on the state affairs committee which has the responsibility of serving as the watchdog for the chemical industry jnt rest at the state level this committee was formed four years age so were in the same position as a politician completing his first term in office and running for reelection on the record in the case of this committee that record is a good one so far the stakes have been high at the state level congress passes major environmental legislation  the clean water act clean air act resource conservation and recovery act safe drinking water act and superfund but all of these are minimum requirements and the states are permitted  and even encouraged  to go farther daniel bean writing for the policy studies journal underscored the rising importance of state governments he said they are no longer regarded as horse and buggy governments as they were in the s and are coming once again to be viewed as laboratories of innovation and democracy the conservation foundation has pointed out that environmentalists of a decade ago generally sought federal solutions to pollution problems they now look frequently to the states recognizing that washington has no monopoly on environmental virtue examples are numerous california regulations on hazardous wastes were copied in last years rcra reauthorization california laws passed by sher and katz in  and  were models for the present federal regulations of pits ponds and lagoons very recently the league of women voters initiated a program on household hazardous wastes focused at the local level the effort quickly spawned twenty bills this year at the state level and promises to attract the attention of us epa if not congress even today new jersey state legislators are directly affecting the congressional debate on community righttoknow and catastrophe prevention cma  four years ago as cma responded to the increasing importance of state issues they recognized the challenges  the political playing field is geographically spread over  states  there are thousands of key players  seventyfive hundred legislators alone with staffers and executive agency personnel numbering thousands more  there are  bills introduced each year which could affect our business  timing for political action at the state level is measured in days not months or years as is frequently the case in congress to meet these challenges cma developed a unique program that is built on sound managerial and political principles set priorities on issues to make the most of limited resources get involved as early as possible in the political process to maximize effectiveness develop position statements and supporting arguments before the issue surfaces to keep up with the fast track political emphasize local involvement for early alert and political effectiveness those on the scene have the best chance of knowing whats developing and politicians listen best to those who elect them to implement this program a network of state chemical industry councils and trade associations was chosen to be the cornerstone of cmas field marketing force to sell our positions on priority issues but it was clear that the network needed lots of support and direction as jim murray reported last year activities were planned to cultivate that network by making cma a focal point of information m cma  gathered from the collective national resources of our industry many f these activities are well underway and have truly turned cma into a center of excellence for state issues member company personnel and state trade associations are routinely turning to cma for advice and guidance other industry trade associations like american petroleum institute and the national agricultural chemical association are contacting cma on mutually important state issues associations of elected officials like national governors association national conference of state legislators council of state governments and even the national association of towns and townships are turning to cma for input on policy positions agenda ideas and speakers these indications of success are gratifying but most importantly the cma approach has clearly helped produce bottom line results for member companies our system was severely tested this year and it worked lock at some specific results lets by june of last year community righttoknow was targeted for priority coverage for the then upcoming  legislative session drawing on two years of experience with this issue at both the state and federal levels cma staff efficiently pulled together a wealth of information position papers with backup arguments copies of all previous state laws and regulations and copies of testimony that had been given before congress and at the state level in addition cma state affairs group held regional information seminars on the subject to educate members of the cics network when bhopal hit in december the cma state affairs organization as a whole was well prepared for the unprecedented flood of state hills that were promptly dumped into the legislative hopper when the dust settled this year over  bills on this subject had been introduced in  states and over  states passed some righttoknow provisions state legislators had developed new proposals to force governmental control on our plants and tried to move the issue far beyond the cma position although battles are still being fought in california new jersey and michigan to date all the laws passed this year are generally consistent with cma policy we have retained our trade secret protection rights and successfully avoided costly requirements for unique labeling environmental emission monitoring and independent risk management audit public compensation was another priority issue where the results were good it was an active issue in five states  california massachusetts new jersey minnesota and rhode island cmas position was that no administrative public compensation program was needed and cma  tort law should not be changed the cma policy committees marching orders to the state troops in the field were clear  hold pork chop cma staff and member company representatives helped guide the strategy in these states the uarep study results were effectively used in conjunction with expert testimony provided by personnel from centers for disease control academia the insurance industry the legal profession and our own companies we were successful in four of the five states and marginally successful in the fifth only minnesota passed a public compensation bill which established an administrative fund  and it was very limited in scope the situation there was unique in that local industry supported the legislation because it solved some severe insurability problems created by an earlier  minnesota superfund law the results on another priority issue  state superfund laws  also were good we successfully prevented both the adoption of unacceptable liability language and the inclusion of provisions for personal injury compensation state superfund fees were held within reasonable limits although some increased significantly cma also played a role in preventing further proliferation of unique state regulations of toxic air contaminants as an example massachusetts has been slowed down in their effort to regulate  compounds in six months by shortcutting good science reason has prevailed despite massachusetts impatience with the federal government for only promulgating regulations for six  hazardous pollutants since  progress was even made in the transportation are  cma helped orchestrate the passage of a couple of more good samaritan laws bringing the total to  states cma member companies took the lead in these cases our preparation over the previous three years paid off and our network delivered but we cant rest on past success the outlook for the future is one of increasing challenges additional releases of toxic substances since bhopal continue to erode our privilege of selfregulation instead of being innocent until proven guilty industry now can look forward to trying to justify its existence and its very right to operate in the neighborhood cma  cur challenge will be to prove that our operations will not create a problem the burden of proving this kind of negative is limited only by reasonableness as defined by state authorities whose survival in office depends on their response to political winds at the same time the political climate is policy is turning the spotlight on state and issues  groundwater regulation and toxic air will be handled primarily by the states if the deteriorating federal local programs two contaminants control  when epa announced its groundwater strategy it was  quote  based on tradition deeply ingrained in our legal and institutional history the states have and should continue to have fundamental responsibility for protection and management of the resource itself states will be deciding when and how much industry pays for multimillion dollar programs related to  cleaning up groundwater under existing plant sites  providing alternative sources of drinking water for the public  requiring retrofit capital for existing facilities to ensure better groundwater protection states will maintain the right to ban the use or sale of certain ehemical products if groundwater is threatened the story is similar for air toxic control on june  lee thomas announced a substantially new approach for reducing public health risks from airborne toxic pollutants federal standards for individual contaminants will no longer be the prime tactic for control of air toxics epa plans to provide financial assistance for strengthening state programs for control of air toxics from large point sources having localized impacts we will have to address the issue not in washington but at the numerous locations where problems are felt to exist no longer will states have to wait for us epa to act before they can require new emission controls on toxics tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars for additional emission controls are at stake clearly groundwater of our top priorities for in january our opponents of the same issues we had and toxic air contaminant issues will be two next year in addition when the bell rings will be back for the next round on several last year cma  sufepfumd some have estimated that by  total state superfund program costs will exceed those of cercla as states tackle more abandoned sites not on the national priority list and pay more for longterm sits maintenance righttoknow our opponents will push for what they did not get this year  emission monitoring and independent audits of our plant safety programs public compensation minnesotas action this year will cause some states to play catchup in addition plaintiff lawyers will continue to push to reduce burden of proof for chronic health cases their carrot is hundreds of millions of dollars of court settlements hazardous waste disposal practices the push to phase out landfills and deep wells will continue hazardous substance transportation issue postbhopal analysis of risks will focus on transportation of hazardous materials routing restrictions and additional fees will be considered cur planning conference in june identified these as priority issues and we have established some specific objectives to improve our effectiveness in tackling them  expand our computerized early alert and information network to improve staff productivity  setter use of public relations or advocacy communication at state level  establish twoway electronic mail capabilities with key chemical industry councils to better meet their needs our action plans for next year remain consistent with the original premise of the cma state affairs program basically we target to do what we do better cma  last year jim murray stood before you to ask for additional cma staff support for the state program you responded and i think the results speak for themselves the team has performed on behalf of everyone who was out there in the trenches i want to borrow a slogan used by the united way a cogple of years age and say  thanks to we have built a national network that is stronger than any one of us could have done on our own by leveraging our position we have produced very good returns on our rather limited investment the cma state affairs effort needs your continued support next year in four basic areas maintain cma staff support at the same level as last year provide additional active member company personnel to serve on state cma task groups established for the priority issues support state trade associations and chemical industry councils with dues and experienced people bill wood will expand on this request in his presentation which follows involve senior chemical industry executives in state matters with follow up provided by local personnel with your continued support in these areas cma state affairs committee should do an even better job next year as the watchdog for our industry at the state level cma cma  f exhibit c executive summary state chemical organizations status report background during the past several years there has been increasing interest in the status programs and collective capabilities of the various organizations representing the chemical industry at the state level these organizations include state chemical associations state chemical industry councils cics and chemical industry committees of state manufacturers associations in addition there has also been interest expressed concerning how the evolving state and local involvement of cma fits with the existing programs prior ities and capabilities of the state organizations formation oe work group to meet this need an ad hoc work group was assembled composed of member company state and public affairs professionals who both individually and through the corporations they represent had played a key role in the development and evolution of state organizations around the country objectives the work group identified the following objectives for this report prepare a comprehensive status report on the current objectives structure finances programs plans and needs of the various state organizations assess the collective current resources and capabilities of the  state organizations  draw some conclusions about the overall operation of the state groups identifying particularly those elements which make successful cic programs successful and those elements which inhibit success develop and communicate recommendations for both cma and member company actions relative to improving and supporting the state organizations and their existing missions the following were clearly not the objectives of the report evaluate or judge the performance of any individual state organization assess or develop an overall cma program for expanded involvement at the state and local level this could follow however based on this groups report and utilizing a broaderbased range of interest and expertise cma   personal survey of state organizations in order to carry out its objectives the group developed a survey which sought information and opinion from and about each organization in the following areas organization including structure funding staffing and member participation issue coverage advocacy programs legislative regulatory publicmedia communications education grassroots etc commu nications and imagebuilding activities and future plans and needs the group personally interviewed a range of individuals in each state to seek their input and this material was then compiled and analyzed by the work group summaries of the state surveys are contained in the full report and are presented in chart form following this executive summary conclusion from survey organizational classification the  state organizations may be classified into four organizational categories needs for cics in states of primary importance the chemical industry needs to have a network of strong cics either independent or affiliated with other state business associations with multiple capabilities to achieve not only the primary goal in each state which is minimizing inappropriate legislation but also the national goals of the chemical industry as well which include independent with an all volunteer effort alabama and delaware independent largely volunteer but with a parttime staff consultant andor lobbyist pennsylvania florida michigan illinois missouri affiliated with state trade association utilizing principally trade association staff but may have own parttime staff consultant or lobbyist new york connecticut ohio tennessee kentucky west virginia massachusetts independent with one or more fulltime staff members together with a multicommittee structure responsible for individual programs texas louisiana new jersey california uniformity in state legislationregulation avoidance of bad precedents for federal legislation support for federal grassroots program support for regional communications efforts on national issues support for caerncric programs and any other industry initiatives which require local implementation or support programs and capabilities collectively the  state groups represent a broad spectrum of programs and capabilities while a few can be deemed fully functional organizations with multifaceted programs many are still seeking their identity or are otherwise in a state of transition or growth it is also important to point out that many still see their role restricted almost entirely to direct legislative and regulatory advocacy much progress has been made in the last five years and more will follow with the proper leadership member company commitment and the allocation of sufficient resources cma   budget and finances the budgets and dues structures of the various state organizations varies enormously from statetostate with the budget range being from  to over  this variance can be somewhat misleading since  groups operate affiliated with state manufacturers associations to whom they pay dues separately however it is accurate to say that with the exception of four states texas louisiana new jersey and california the rest of the state organizations generally operate on budgets of well under  per year the bulk of the resources are not provided by direct dues but are contributed in the form of member company personnel and expertise dues are generally based on a flat fee plus surcharges for additional facilities and number of employees elements which contribute to successful cic programs following were identified the strong commitment by senior management of major companies with the largest instate presence and resources broad participation by chemical industry companies represented in that state with human as well as financial resources com mitted to the program strong qualitative and quantitative cic staff support  full or parttime lobbyist executive director ormanufacturers association staff located in the state capitol member company support of an equitable fee structure which generates sufficient revenue to operate a meaningful program strong programs do not seem to be seriously affected by economic downturns focus on strong legislative or leglslatlveregulatory programs with the goal being to make a meaningful impact on the public policy process recognition of the cic as the prime resource on our issues strong working relationship with cma and other key allied industries and the ability to deal effectively with the opposition member company satisfaction and the degree to which they feel they are being adequately represented in the legislative process where appropriate strong affiliation with the state manufac turers association access to political action committee resources strong grassroots program acit elements which prevent cic programs from being fully effective the following elements were identified as factors which may prevent individual programs from being fully effective lack of sufficient chemical industry representation in the state lack of commitment by key instate companies lack of technical expertisespecialized resources being made available geographic spread of members in the state  difficulty in getting to capital easilyfrequently cma   lack of adequate funding or an otherwise flawed dues system which lacks member support lack of strong retained leadershipstaff services lack of agreement on commonpriorlty goals and effective ways to meet those goals negative mediaimage of the industry in the state inability to network or work with other business organizations and cma credibility and militancy of the other side in the state comparison with other manufacturing industries state programs the cmacic network approach was compared and contrasted to the programs operated by the tobacco industry and the petroleum industry the cmacic program was determined to be increasingly effective at a cost of about oneeighth of the api or tobacco institute approach of a large centralized program recommendations the following recommendations for cma and its member companies were developed based upon the survey interviews and work group discussions these recommendations are designed to enhance the state chemical organizations ability to carry out their present missions the primary and in some cases exclusive one being state legislative and regulatory advocacy to the extent the industrys priorities for these organizations change or significantly evolve a further examination and some additional actions and recommendations will be required cma actions under current circumstances the nature of the organizational relationship between cma and the individual state chemical organizations should remain as it is rather than move toward the api approach of integrated state petroleum councils funded and staffed directly by the national organization cma priorities should be on strengthening existing cics rather than creating new ones at this time cma should carefully consider how the industry should be collectively represented in those states without cics and where there is a distinct chemical industry issue which will not be adequately addressed otherwise specifically should resources be made available to have a cma state lobbyist on a retained basis where circumstances warrant cma should allocate funds to help finance specific projects or operations of state chemical councils on a seed moneymatching grant program to assist in getting new or expanded operations going such grants for projects or expanded operations should be for a limited time and made under specific criteria and standards cma   the focus of such cma funding should be on supporting those programs and priorities of the chemical industry which are of interstate and national significance funding for ongoing programs and for issues and projects primarily of intrastate interest should continue to be funded directly by the member companies of each state organization similar funds currently provided through the cma communication program to help initiate issueoriented communication projects at the state level also have value and should be continued cma should continue and renew its efforts to build a stronger overall relationship between cma and the individual cics so that cma and the cics can better utilize each others capabil ities specifically cma should increase its efforts to provide technicalscientific legal support to the cics on the state aspects of key chemical industry issues continue to devote adequate resources to its ongoing internal state affairs and communications programs which provide direct support to state cic efforts provide continuing support to increase membership and active participation in the cics and should continue to seek ways to increase the visibility of the efforts of the cics with senior management continue efforts in working with other national business associations on state level cooperation and coordination examine options for developing more equitable and uniform methods for funding cic operations fund and conduct leadership and training workshops for cic staff and key member company volunteers in leadership positions in the cics member company actions top down corporate involvement by senior chemical industry executives in state government affairs generally and in cic activities specifically they need to make effective cics a priority in their organizations by joining where they manufacture or otherwise have an interest providing adequate financial resources providing the right kind of people to support the effort making corporate technical resources available top down personal support and involvement by senior chemical industry executives in state matters particularly legislative cma   advocacy individuals in aach corporation naad to selectively lnvolva senior executives in these issues this will increase corporate awareness of the serious nature of the state issues and will also increase changes for legislative success member companies should assign an individual overall respon sibility for state affairs for the corporation member companies should bring cio staffleaders to corporate headquarters for briefings on key state issues action required member companies should consider individual actions based upon the member company recommendations in the report cma should evaluate the individual cma recommendations in the

the management of priority issues linking legislative and communications efforts and cma  exhibit e administrations  tax reform proposal report on cma positions and actions backqtound on may  president reagan announced his s tax reform program in general the presidents program would shift almost  billion of the federal income tax burden now borne by individuals to business taxpayers within the business sector the presidents program would substantially increase the tax burden of businesses that are capital intensive and that engage in significant international trade although the impact of specific provisions may vary from company to company the overall impact of the presidents tax program would cost the chemical industry more than  billion annually the presidents program provides for a reduction in the maximtan corporate tax rate from  to  percent in addition it provides for a deduction in computing corporate income taxes of  percent of dividends paid offsetting these reductions the presidents plan would repeal the investment tax credit replace the acrs depreciation system with a less favorable capital cost recovery system and replace the present minimum tax with a new minimum tax on corporate income beginning in  significant new recapture rules would apply to taxpayers who took depreciation deductions of  or more in the period january   through july   under these new rules  percent of the excess depreciation claimed for tax purposes over that allowed for earnings and profits less a  overall deduction would be recaptured at post corporate tax rates thus capital intensive taxpayers who used the incentives for capital formation in president reagans  tax program would be subject to significant tax increases over the next three calendar years the presidents tax program also proposes significant changes in the taxation of international activities of us corporations the program would impose a more restrictive per country limitation on the use of the foreign tax credit and would eliminate the old and established title passage test for detesnining the source of income from the sale of property including the export of manufactured products the proposal includes stringent new rules on the allocation of interest expenses among within the members of a consolidated group significant reductions in tax benefits are also provided for activities in us possessions notably puerto rico in general democratic and republican congressional leaders have supported the broad objective to pass tax reform legislation this year the administration and congressional leaders have also agreed for the moment that the objectives of tax refonn should be accomplished in legislation that neither increases nor decreases the flow of tax revenues to the federal government cma program development and response in november  the tax policy cpmmittee identified several major tax issues that are of continuing concern to the chemical industry subsequently the treasury department proposed major tax reforms that would affect many of these subjects at the boards january meeting committee chairman william m bellamy jr reported that the tax policy committee was developing a series of specific issue responses to the treasurys tax reform proposals that could be incorporated into a cma legislative statement in may mr bellamy delivered a progress report to the executive cowaittee and noted that the tax policy coanittee would request that cma commission independent studies for use in cmas tax legislative program cma commissioned pricewaterhouse to conduct a study of effective tax rates in the ehmsical industry also cma provided a grant to the institute for research in the economics of taxation iret to study the impact of selected tax refon proposals on the formation of capital in the chemical industry in july the tax policy coanittee developed a cma legislative statement on the administrations tax program vftiich was presented to the house committee on ways and means by dexter f baker president air products and chemicals inc at its august  and  s meetings the tax policy committee and qic tax legislative task group established

the bill was approved by a vote of  to  with one member noting this vote occurred after six long days that included many emotional abates on the issues the substance of the original bipartisan compromise bill  retained the bill as reported has been judged by cmas technical groups to wa reasonable although it substantially increased the programs and authority over preset law following is a brief list of key issues that were considered and the votes which major and damaging changes were rejected mandatory clean up schedules far more stringent standards of clean up even greater than might be needed to protect health and the environment requirement that privateparty clean ups be more stringent than fundfinanced clean ups requiring that all clean up settlements contain a reopener clause thus preventing final release from liability to be granted remove limits of liability and create joint and several liability in the leaking underground storage tanks program expand the rights of citizens to bring suit against owners of waste disposal sites in federal court if there may be an iminent or substantial endangerment creation of a hazardous substance inventory as part of the community righttoknow provision in the house superfund debate now moves to the house public works and transportation committee subcommittee chairman robert row dnj has had the staff working through the august recess preparing for early september markup environmentalists have been urging the committee to begin debate using the original florio bill which was rejected by the energy and commerce committee tma has recommended the committee begin from hr  the house ways and means committee has tentatively scheduled markup for erly september in addition both the house judiciary cosanittee and the merchant marine and fisheries counittee have been granted jurisdiction of the u this means that five major committees of the house will have considered auperfund before it goes to the rules counittee and it is brought to the house door as a result final passage is unlikely before september  and thus some cma  lapse may wall occur in the taxing authority a  or day dalay should enable congress to complete final action before the end of this year in the senate the superfund bill s si was not brought to the floor before the august recess began as had been predicted delays occurred principally because senators domenici rnm and simpson rwy wanted to perfect amendments dealing with liability and insurance issues these and a host of other amendments are expected to be considered

considering recommending that the us not continue its talks with the consultation shipping group csg of developed countries regarding a formal agreement to oppose cargo reservation cma favors continuation of the talks leading to a formal agreement and is advocating its support to dot and the other executive branch departments and agencies involved in the decision international the congress is increasingly angry about the ever worsening trade situation but frustrated in finding a solution the representative gibbons hr  bill dealing with the use of natural resources is strongly opposed by the administration and parts of the business community the legislative proposal by representative rostenkowski hr  to impose a  percent surcharge on imports has gained many supporters but is considered to be too extreme the many antijapanese proposals are bolstered by the probable  billion trade deficit with that country these measures seem too much a departure from traditional us trade policy for the lawmakers meanwhile the administration is forced to deal with the myriad import problems on an industry by industry basis with remedies available in present law page  cma  the us continues to promote a new gatt round of tariff and non tariff bargaining it is winning support in europe and with other countries the congress is reluctant but does not yet have the administrations request for authority to proceed this is predicted to come yet this fall with negotiations proposed to start in  cma is preparing its policy recommendations for the legislative process and for the negotiation phase the expected us trade deficit of  billion in  is lamented by everyone but no real solution is yet in sight the slight decline of the dollar has raised some hopes for an early end to the trade problem the dollar must drop much further down to make a difference and it will take many months after the drop to become a significant trade factor states in  the national conference of state legislatures polled more than  legislative leaders and legislative research directors asking what were the key issues challenging the  state legislatures budget and tax concerns ranked as the top issues for virtually every legislative agenda some states face tight budgets and are searching for new revenues others are considering the allocation of budget surpluses tax reform and tax cuts in the natural resources area the survey cited hazardous wastes as a top concern for state legislatures issues they expect to address include identification of disposal sites transportation of materials regulation of generators and cleanup efforts at a time when federal aid to the states is diminishing and economic pressures force austerity state legislatures have worked to meet special program needs such as education and health care while the financial industry is undergoing dramatic technological changes legislatures are reshaping their regulatory structures and proposing statutes that recognize the shifting geographic boundaries of financial institutions many problems remain and major reform efforts may undergo further change in the coming years media the media have been focusing increasingly sophisticated attention on public health and safety matters this concentration has been growing since before bhopal and the recent accidental release at institute west virginia according to researchers the media has been developing the theme of corporate acts as the driving force in american society the up side is that the public sees business as the problem solver of choice the down side is the media loves to find feet of clay on the publics heroes corporate governance issues have been among the top five covered by the national media unlike acute stories such as the institute release page  cma  reagans health airline accidents  which may surge to higher levels in the top five  attention to governance has remained steady over six to eight months the media have identified a growing separation between grassroots activists  such lois gibbs clearinghouse on hazardous waste the national coalition against toxic waste ralph naders public interest research groups pirgs and greenpeace  and the socalled gang of   nrdc sierra club wildlife audubon friends of the earth etc the gangs new manifesto an environmental agenda for the future includes issues such as population control trade policy nuclear war and world hunger activists say the traditional groups are becoming irrelevant to domestic environmental questions and have lost touch with the proven timetested confrontational approach to relationships with government and business recent accidents and incidents have strengthened the confrontational hand and could give the traditionalists second thoughts about their recent moves toward more businesslike leadership and cooperative approaches ii issues and program status superfund cercla and old waste site cleanup congressional developments and response senate activity the senate finance coranittee has completed action and reported to the senate floor a funding level and mechanism to s  superfund reauthorization they approved freezing the current feedstock tax and imposing a superfund excise tax set on manufacturing set would apply to sales of tangible personal property by the person who manufactured or produced the property the funding level is  billion for the next  years with  million from feedstocks taxes and  billion from set per year also the committee deleted general revenues from s  mainly to deny funding for the victim assistance demonstration program the senate judiciary committee which was granted sequential referral of the referral of the bill failed to make changes during their referral time period thus members of the judiciary committee may offer amendments on superfund liability and settlements issues senate floor action is expected to occur in september and number of amendments will be offered of concern to cma would be amendments to alter the finance committee funding mechanism that would expand the conmunity righttoknow provisions and that would add general revenue to fund the victims assistance demonstration program also it is expected that senator robert stafford rct will offer am amendment for he the insurance industry it would eliminate insurance policy to coverage prior rage  cma  r to

reauthorization legislation hr  on july  the legislation represents support of a bipartisan coalition led by representatives john dingell dmi dennis eckart doh and norman lent rny voting against reporting hr  were representatives james florio dnj henry waxman dca and  other committee democrats the legislation focuses primarily on cleaning up inactive hazardous waste and sites except in an

committee is not expected to schedule superfund for consideration until after the other committees complete action representative jim jones dok has recently introduced the senate finance committees superfund funding package hr  this means it is unlikely that a housesenate conference can occur and a bill signed into law before the taxing authority expires on september  the superfund task group of cmas government relations committee continues to advocate cmas position on both the funding portion and the programmatic portion of the superfund issues the chemical industrys concern over substantial increase in feedstock taxes is being heard in  congress and the probability of encountering positive increases in the feedstock tax appears to be diminishing much more discussion has developed in congress about the possible need for some new broadbased tax both of these points were emphasized in the introduction of other bills in both the house and the senate but an industry coalition has formed to fight against the enactment in superfund of a broadbased tax including the finance cosnittees superfund excise tax cma also continues to work actively with other industry trade associations to develop broadbased support for many of the issues  grassroots activities the grassroots program continues to respond to the changing legislative status of the superfund reauthorization during early  most grassroots activity was targeted to members of the energy and commerce committee those efforts were apparent in the final energy and commerce committee vote to report hr  of the fourteen

to intervene in american mining congress v environmental protection agency no  dc cir this case involves a challenge to epas new definition of solid waste published as a final rule on january   cmas motion to intervene has been granted cma became involved in this case for two reasons first cma has teen closely associated with the development of the new definition of page cm  solid waste and therefore was interested in continuing this involvement to assure that our members interests are protected in addition the final rule has deviated from the proposal in one significant respect it brings within the definition of solid waste onsite reclamation activities that are a part of a chemical process as a result cma members may be faced with having to apply for rcra permits for many hundreds of reclamation processes and associated storage tanks cma has met with epa to determine whether alternative regulatory schemes can be developed that will address epas concerns while excluding

house activity the house bill hr  introduced by rep madigan ril passed the house by voice vote june  the bill differs from the senate bill in two key areas standardsetting and groundwater protection it looks as though the sdwa conference will not take place until september although congressional staff predict that the conference will go smoothly there may be controversy over groundwater protection  a state groundwater planning program in the house bill hr  that is absent from the senate bill the senate conferees are opposed to major page  cma  groundwater protection provisions in the sdw reauthorization senator durenberger wants separate federal legislation to protect groundwater and expects to introduce a bill in the fall see groundwater section in addition the bills differ in standard setting judicial review and authorization levels but hill staffers expect compromise on these issues cma will be supporting the senate bill over the house bill on three issues standard setting no comprehensive groundwater protection program and the senate critical aquifer demonstration program instead of the house sole source groundwater senator oave durenberger rmn has held three hearings as he pre pares to introduce his groundwater protection bill this fall the first two hearings held on june  and  were on groundwater quality and quantity contamination and policy issues and state efforts the third hearing focused on epas groundwater protection strategy which calls for epa to provide financial assistance to the states additional hearings will be held in washington in september and october which is when cma will testify senator durenberger plans on circulating a draft bill for comment in september  technical and research activities application of risk analysis to groundwater issues the risk assessment task group conducted a review of the application of risk analysis concepts to groundwater issues the review focused previous work in developing risk analysis methods on the specific problems associated with groundwater contamination future activity will identify the application of risk analysis methods to establish acceptable exposure levels to substances found in groundwater definition of key groundwater terms the groundwater management task group developed a glossary of definitions of key groundwater terms the definitions will assure consistent use of key terms in all cma groundwater work products groundwater containment and treatment technologies the water technology task group developed a summary of existing groundwater containment and treatment technologies the summary is available to member companies and cics for their use in addressing groundwater matters alternate supplies of drinking water the groundwater task group developed a paper on alternate supplies of drinking water where contamination exists this paper is an elaboration of a previously approved superfund position on alternate supplies of drinking water the work

regulatory developments and response comprehensive reporting on july  and  epa held public meetings to review a draft reporting rule that epa plans to develop but has not yet formally proposed epa would issue the comprehensive reporting rule under the authority of section a of the toxic substances control act tsca the rule would establish an extensive list of questions and agency procedures for making chemicals subject to the rule once the model rule has been established epa would tailor the rule to ask certain questions about particular chemical substances while such a model rule may establish consistent information requests to companies the draft reporting form includes burdensome questions and questions related to epa programs other than tsca as of yet epa has not developed an agency procedure to prevent duplicative information requests under this draft rule the health and safety committees notification and reporting task group is reviewing the draft and will submit comments to epa in early october negotiated testing from march through july cma epa and the natural resources defense council nrdc worked to develop a procedure for negotiating test agreements and developing test rules under tsca section  this collaborative effort grew out of cmas appeal of a district court decision that invalidated epas previous procedures for negotiating test agreements under tsca section  the guiding principle in developing this new procedure has been that test rules and negotiated testing agreements should be equivalent consent orders under tsca section  would be the primary mechanism to satisfy that principle as with test rules the consent orders would include requirements to ensure adequate and reliable data would be enforceable and would require export notification under tsca section b in addition to these features of the consent order the new procedures would include an opportunity for public participation an expedited schedule for negotiating and rulemaking and a change in interagency testing committee itc procedures to provide sufficient time page  cma  to either negotiate agreements or prepare rules on chemicals the itc nominates to epa for testing consideration in august the final draft of the preamble and procedural rule were reviewed by the health and safety committee after signoff by the parties involved epa will issue the procedures

competition congressional developments and response revision of trade remedy laws as he did in the last congress rep sam gibbons dfl has introduced a bill to amend countervailing duty laws by defining as a subsidy the practice of using natural resource rawmaterials not available page  to foreign investors for the production of finished goods this provision was included in a bill which passed the house by a sizeable margin in the last congress the natural resources provision was deleted by the housesenate conference which produced the trade and tariff act of  the current gibbons bill hr  would require the us manufacturer to prove that injury has occurred before countervailing duties could be imposed the addition of this injury test is an attempt to achieve support from the administration for the concept the administration however still views the proposal as protectionist and is opposing it the trade subcommittee of the house ways and means committee has already held several days of hearings on the issue and plans additional hearings in the fall the cma executive committee declined to take a position on the natural resources issue at its march   meeting import surcharge representative dan rostenkowski dthil has introduced a bill which would impose an import surcharge on all goods from selected countries the bill was introduced with  cosponsors but a substantial additional number of congressmen are expected to also cosponsor the bill hearings on this matter are planned for early fall the bill would apply to all countries whose  imports to the us exceeded  billion one half of this initial amount or  billion is to be indexed in future years to the  us gross national product any country which meets the above eligibility must keep its ratio of imports to the united states to exports from the united states below  or ratios of worldwide imports to exports below  if it fails to do so all imports from that country will be assessed a  percent ad valorem rate of duty which is in addition to any existing duty already in use earlier this year the motorola corporation proposed an acrosstheboard import surcharge for three years as a means of combatting the deficit such a proposal has yet to be introduced as legislation cmas international trade committee has held preliminary discussions on the concept of an import surcharge it appears that the committee is opposed to an acrosstheboard imposition of additional duties but it has not yet decided whether to take a position international negotiationsagreements usisrael free trade agreement the usisrael free trade agreement fta has been passed by the congress and signed into law it becomes effective in september under the provisions of the agreement virtually all duties will be eliminated on goods imported into the united states from israel certain import sensitive items including most bromine chemicals will have duties page  cma  phased out over a ten year period rather than having them eliminated immediately the fta does require that goods imported from israel must have had a minimum of  percent of the value of the good added in israel also under the fta the us international trade commission is required to conduct a study after five years to determine if any industries or products have suffered harm as a result of the agreement the cma did not establish a position on this

support senator damatos efforts as soon as his language is finalized a major effort will be made by cma companies to generate support for the damato approach as a constructive alternative to the lautenberg amendments to s si in the meantime senator lautenberg dnj introduced a new bill dealing with emergency response s  which he intends to offer as a floor amendment to superfund although it is significantly scaled down from prior drafts the new bill appears to raise problems which cmas health and safety committee will be reviewing during the august congressional recess in the house the energy and commerce committee marked up and reported out hr  with community rtk provisions essentially intact the material safety data sheets msds were preserved as the vehicle for hazards communication emergency response provisions are consistent with cmas caer program an inventoryemissions reporting amendment similar to senator lautenbergs was defeated by the committee trade secret protection was made consistent with the osha hazard communication standard the committee approved a limited preemption of state and local laws adopted after august   a great deal of effort by cma and its member companies resulted in a final rtk product by the energy and commerce committee which we are generally pleased with and can support in the house as a better approach than other existing proposals also in the house the public works subcommitte on water resources chaired by robert roe dnj held a hearing july  on community rtk as part of its consideration superfund john jones of dow

communication standard preempts state righttoknow laws as they apply to manufacturers united steelworkers of america v auchter  fd  d cir   cma intervened in the case to argue for preemption and to defend the standards trade secret provision the court left open the question of whether state righttoknow laws that cover employers beyond the manufacturing sector and that have community righttoknow provisions are preempted by the federal hazard communication standard the court said page  cma  that question must be answered by examining each state law to determine if the provisions are inextricably intertwined there are two cases pending in pennsylvania and new jersey where preemption of righttoknow laws outside the manufacturing sector and in the community is an issue the court also ordered osha to amend its definition of trade secret and in doing so not to go beyond the common law definition osha was also ordered to provide for employee access both the manufacturers employees as well as downstream employees to trade secret information the standard currently provides such access only to health professionals no party has petitioned the supreme court to hear the case at this time it appears there will be a new rulemaking on the trade secret issues and osha will also publish an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking on the issue of expanding the scope of

on june th that hr  is not an effective and efficient approach to potential public health risks presented by the release of toxic chemicals into the air that a bill must distinguish more clearly between large volume accidental release of page  cma  acutely toxic materials and lowlevel exposures to substances over longer periods of time and that cma is prepared to help congress design appropriate legislation while continuing to develop and implement new initiatives to control hazardous air pollutants also during the june  hearings congressman john dingell dmi voiced strong opposition to hr  at the other day of hearings there were industry witnesses representing aluminum electric power motor vehicles and consumer products an effort to affix portions of hr  to the

has also been introduced by senator wendell h ford dky and representative rahall hearings have not been scheduled but activity may occur in the session when the interstate commerce commission icc completes a rulemaking presently underway that addresses rail competition the bills introduced have not received the support of the administration some congressional support is further present for linking rail competition issues and protection for captive shippers with legislative proposals under consideration to transfer conrail to the private sector differing views exist among the many shipping coalitions that have been formed as to whether the staggers rail act of  needs refinement major amendment or left to proper implementation by the icc cma continues to work to maintain and enhance railtorail competition and insure proper implementation of existing law negotiations with the railroads have resulted in some agreement with regard to procompetitive access issues the agreement between cma and the american association of railroads aar has resulted in am icc proposed rulemaking and would basically obviate the need for legislation on matters addressed discussions with congressional leaders and ad hoc groups continue as legislative measures ire proposed conrail bipartisan bills have been introduced that would sell the consolidated rail corporation conrail to an investor group formed by morgan stanley  co inc the legislation provided for the sale of the governments  percent share of the freight system for  billion and resale of at least  percent of the railroad to the public through one or more stock offerings within five years vage  cma  the senate commerce science and transportation committee reported bill would authorize the sale of conrail to the norfolk southern corporation the administration is supporting the private offering to norfolk southern as the result of a dot approved bid process opposition to a conrail merger with norfolk southern continues regarding antitrustcompetitive implications and the tax benefits that would derive senate judiciary committee amendments to the administration bill are expected and there is indication that a filibuster could occur on the house side the hearing process will continue after the august recess the use of conrail tax deductions as well as the antitrust aspects of a merger are under review by the house ways and means committee and the house judiciary committee respectively additional hearings will be held before the house energy and connerce subcommittee on commerce transportation and tourism the morgan stanley plan backed by conrail management and will be the primary focus of hearings in the fall supporters amendments to the staggers bail act to provide captive shipper may also attempt to link other rail issues with the passage of conrail enabling legislation rail labor of protection the sale of concern has been expressed during hearings that provisions must be included in any conrail sale agreement to assure competition cma has advocated the assurance of rail competition in the northeast corridor the morgan stanley company proposal for a public offering is supported by cma as the most viable option for the disposition of conrail regulatory development and response conrail acquisition the distribution cosuittee developed a position paper on the administrations proposal to sell the conrail system to the norfolksouthem railroad corporation of primary concern is the reduction in competitive service that may occur if conrail is sold to norfolk southern cma believes a public sale of conrail as proposed by morgan stanley fi company would not reduce competitive rail service in the eastern os therefore cma supports the morgan stanley proposal rates and compensation tank car compensation cma other tank car providers and the railroads have successfully arrived at an agreement on the appropriate level of compensation for tank car use this level of payout is  million the issues of enforceability and the form and duration of the agreement have also been resolved the joint agreement has been submitted to the icc for rulemaking rail to rail competition a compromise agreement between cma and the railroads on the issue of competitive access to shipping facilities has been reached this agreement is intended to enhance the competitive alternatives available to chemical shippers by allowing rail carriers to compete for freight when they do not control the track immediately serving a plant age  cma  cma and the railroads have jointly petitioned the icc to enact our agreement cma also submitted a supplemental petition to expand the scope of the rulemaking by including the concepts of proportional rates and terminal facilities cma participated in oral argument on july  and anticipates the icc ruling on the issues by midseptember on july  the icc issued a  decision in midtee vs cnw that if upheld could substantially undermine the benefits of the agreemereached with railroads the commission ruled that before it will order competitive access for the competing carrier the controlling carrier must be shown to be market dominant and charging an unreasonably high rate cma is considering intervening in the appeal of the midtec case product and geographic competition before a shipper may challen rail rate as being unreasonably high the shipper must demonstrate th the railroad has market dominance over the traffic two factors being considered are whether the receiver can obtain the product from other sources geographic competition or can obtain substitute products product competition on july   the icc announced that it will modify its product and geographic competition guidelines the major changes will be  that the railroad must bear the burden of proving these issues and  the effect of geographic competition will be viewed differently depending on whether the shipper is the receiver originator of the product the icc adopted a few of cmas suggested changes to the proposed rules but rejected ourmost significant changes as well as cmas petition for a supplemental rulemaking that would have applied a herfindahl market share analysis to the market dominance issue coal rate guidelines the icc recently adopted the criteria by which it will judge the reasonableness of coal rates the criteria are likely to be proposed for chemical rates in a separate rulemaking soon the criteria would permit a railroad to charge a rate based on what it would hypothetically cost the shipper to build and maintain a rail line for its traffic the rate must also reflect contributions to the cost by other shippers and efficient operations by the railroad argentinabrazil cargo reservation laws cma developed evidence demonstrating the adverse effects resulting from the cargo reservation laws enacted by argentina and brazil conments setting forth the industrys concerns were submitted to the federal maritime commission cma participated in a delegation of government officials that undertook a factfinding mission to brazil to determine the anticompetitive impact of the brazilian laws chemical bulk parcel rates cma is opposing efforts by chemical bulk parcel tanker operators to obtain antitrust immunity to collectively set rates cma believes that competitive pricing is essential

running  above last year and emergency reports are  age  cma  above last years totals for the period january through july we believe the increases are a result of heightened awareness about the chemtrec program and increased public concern about incidents involving chemicals chemtrec workshops the third emergency response team workshop will be held in baltimore maryland at the end of october instruction for this workshop will be handled by instructors from the delaware fire school chemnet based on a meeting on june   with cma members the chemnet policy statement and agreement and the chemnet operating rules were revised and resubmitted to the membership on july   for their consideration as of august  we have received  participant agreements and  subscriber agreements from cma members these  companies represent a large percentage of the chemicals shipped in this country we have also received verbal confirmation from approximately  additional companies that they would join the chemnet system therefore we will be beginning the chemnet operations with almost  members we have also tentatively selected four emergency response contractors to act as the forhire contractors in the chemnet system these contractors have teams at locations throughout the united states and can reach most areas within  to  hours of notification we hope to sign contracts with all four firms while  members and four contractors represent enough emergency response capability to start up the chemnet system we must redouble our efforts to enroll more chemical companies into the system or the public will misunderstand and be disappointed by the coverage of the chemnet program a campaign to enlist more companies has begun chemical referral center the chemical referral center crc which will become operational by the end of  is designed to provide those that desire health and safety information about a particular chemical with a company contact that can furnish such information the distribution committee has established a work group to oversee the operation of the chemical referral center thus far  cma member companies have signed on to the program information pertaining to the chemicals and products they produce are being submitted to cma this information will be the foundation of a computerized chemical index that cma operators will use to link products with manufacturers as a public

chemtrec appearances on two national television programs on cbs and cnn were organized energy and petrochemical feedstocks congressional developments and response natural gas the debate over natural gas issues is primarily concentrated in the regulatory arena where the federal energy regulatory conmission ferc rulemaking process has intensified ferc activity particularly a proposal dealing with the transportation or carriage of gas is under close congressional scrutiny an amendment adopted by the senate appropriations committee would prohibit ferc from putting into effect any rule dealing with gas transportation issues pending congressional review between enactment of the energy and water appropriation bill and the end of the first session of the th congress senator j bennett johnston dla withdrew his amendment on the senate floor after assurances made by the ferc chairman opponents of the appropriation amendment believe that ferc is proceeding under ongoing legislative authority and that limiting the scope of ferc action is an unwarranted intrusion in the independent regulatory process the ferc will probably be allowed to conduct transportation programs while congress is reviewing fercs rulemaking house energy leaders opposed the appropriations amendment however the house fossil and synthetic fuels subcommittee submitted several substantive questions to ferc regarding the rulemaking process rag  cma  legislation unlikely to move quickly is pending in both the senate and house a bill introduced by senator don nickles rok would repeal incremental pricing and fuel use restraints and decontrol the price of all gas under renegotiated or expiring gas purchase contracts senate oversight hearings on the status of the natural gas industry have been held in the subcotmnittee on energy regulation and conservation a bill offered by senator bill bradley dnj would require mandatory contract carriage by pipeline companies it is expected that house energy and commerce cononittee chairman john dingell dmi and fossil and synthetic fuels subcommittee chairman philip r sharp din will hold oversight hearings on natural gas issues including matters presently before the ferc repeal of gas incremental pricing provisions of the natural gas policy act ngpa and fuel use act fua restrictions are the focus of most attention in the house representative jim slattery dks and dan coates rin havr introduced a bill that just repeal the natural gas demand restraints under the fua and ngpa representative bill richardson dmm and william e dannemeyer rca have proposed a more comprehensive measure that would repeal demand restraints further deregulate and require contract carriage cma continues to monitor legislative proposals and file comments and present testimony before ferc cma has requested that ferc act expeditiously on issuing a rule on nondiscriminatory transportation oil import fee a congressional attempt was made before the august recess to propose an oil import fee as part of the federal budget deficit reduction package president reagan flatly rejected the proposal consistent with his stated desire not to increase taxes to reduce budget deficits however a continuing willingness has been demonstrated by key senate leaders to consider some form of taxation on energy as a means to generate revenue senate budget conferees offered a proposal that would impose a  per barrel levy on imported crude oil and a  per barrel fee on imports of refined petroleum products the proposal was endorsed by senate majority leader robert j dole rks senate budget committee chairman pete v domenici rnm and finance committee chairman senator bob packwood ror some administration opposition to an oil import fee has been qualified and the negotiations over budget matters may revive interest in additional taxes on energy proposals that may be considered during budget deliberations include a broadbased consumption sales tax on energy a btu tax a value added approach an increased gasoline excise tax crude oil excise taxes and oil import fees a current market surplus of petroleum coupled with the opec price decline is also influencing the views of many in congress legislation that would impose a  per barrel fee on imported oil and refined petroleum products has been introduced by representative james h weaver dor and senator gary hart dco senators david boren dok and lloyd bentsen dtx are also sponsoring legislation that would  cma  levy a tax on imported oil and oil products a bill has also been offered by representative anthony c beilenson dca that would phase in a so cent a gallon excise tax on gasoline senator lowell p weicker rct has offered a proposal that would phase in a  cent increase in the gasoline excise tax no immediate action is expected on the bills introduced the economic impact of various energy taxes on the chemical industry continues to be monitored and reviewed at cma key administration officials have been contacted concerning the impact of energy taxes on the chemical industry cma advocacy and liaison with other industry groups is oriented in opposition to the imposition of new or additional energy taxes a broad coalition has sent a letter to president reagan reiterating opposition to any additional tax on energy regulatory developments and response rulemaking on transportation of natural gas on may   the federal energy regulatory commission proposed a major rule with respect to the regulation of natural gas the purpose of the rule is to require nondiscrimination in blanket transportation programs and to encourage competition in natural gas markets cma joined a broad coalition of industrial users in submitting comments on the proposed rule these coments expressed support for the major policy directions and many of the details of the connissions proposals the comments however also urged several important modifications in particular the connission should not adopt the part d approach for separate billing of low and highpriced gas in addition to written comments cma testified before the commission on august  the testimony strongly supported the commissions efforts to facilitate equal access to outer continental shelf gas and urged further actions in this regard the testimony also criticized the commission for failing to address the substantial regulatory obstacle created by incremental pricing cma urged the comaission to suspend the operation of the incremental pricing program for a definite period of time finally cma asked the connission to withdraw part d of the proposed rule eliminating traditional rolledin pricing in favor of allocating and billing old gas separately from all other gas would create serious distortions in the natural gas market taxation congress hearings on tax reform continued to be the principal issue in july for both the house committee on ways and means and the senate committee on finance although the cost of each of these provisions may vary from company to company their combined impact to the chemical industry will exceed  billion annually on july  dexter f baker chief executive officer air products and chemicals inc testified on behalf of the association before the committee on ways and means in his page  cma  testimony which was followed by a minute colloquy with several members of the committee mr baker demonstrated a very credible knowledge of related tax and trade issues cma s position on tax reform legislation may be briefly summarized in these key points o support of comprehensive tax reform and president reagans goals of economic growth fairness and simplicity however the administrations may   tax proposals fail to meet these goals o the proposed shift of current individual tax burdens to corporations and more specifically to capitalintensive corporations will seriously damage the economy and the prospects for sustained growth o in order to keep us products competitive in domestic and world markets os manufacturers need capital cost recovery provisions comparable to those our foreign competitors enjoy thus congress should maintain the investment tax credit and accelerated cost recovery system acrs and should reject the recapture tax on the socalled windfall from accelerated depreciation o the limit on foreign tax determined on an overall countrybycountry limit for foreign assets would of double taxation credits should continue to be basis the proposed change to a and the year depreciable life substantially increase the threat o the title passage test should remain the basis for determining the source of income for exports and similar sales in addition congress should reject the proposed change in the allocation of interest expenses o the percent tax credit for research and experimentation should be extended as proposed by the president and the moratorium on allocation of research and development expenses under regulations  should be made permanent the house senate compromise on a joint congressional resolution on the budget for fiscal  has cooled a threat that an oil import fee or tax increase proposal would be adopted to gain control over mounting federal deficits president reagans efforts to secure a compromise on the congresssional budget resolution have undercut support for his tax reform plan among senate republicans many of whom contend that the president sacrificed a tough senate budget stance without first obtaining offsetting savings from the house conferees senate and house leaders have attacked both the fairness and the revenue neutrality of the administrations tax proposal senate finance committee chairman bob packwood ror ha argued that the proposals page  cma  provisions to repeal the deduction of state and local taxes and the special deduction for married couples in which there are two wage earners would increase taxes for many middleincome taxpayers citing the revenue estimates by the staff of the joint committee on taxation house ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski dil called upon the administration to identify where additional revenues could be raised to maintain the promised revenue neutrality of the overall program both challenges would appear to have had a major impact on the congressional tax reform debate under these circumstances congress could have greater latitude to pickand choose from the presidents tax program in fashioning a congressional vehicle anticipating that the ways and means committee could begin the selection of the specific components of a tax reform bill as early as september cma is developing its plan for further early action on this important legislation the washington business community is divided on the merits of the presidents tax proposal as the elements of a congressional tax alternative become more definite the opportunities for greater business unity will increase significantly cma continues to coordinate its efforts on tax

infringement against a party who imports a product that is manufactured abroad by using the process state legislative and regulatory activity superfund missouri missouris method of paying for hazardous waste cleanups will change in  under a law signed by governor john ashcroft the hazardous waste cleanup program currently is funded with an employee tax imposed on each hazardous waste generator under the new statute the head tax will be replaced by a waste volume tax effective january   or earlier if receipts to the remedial fund fall below  million annually hazardous waste which is landfilled or storedwill be taxed at twice the rate for treated or recycled waste missouris hazardous waste management commission is directed by the new law to set the tax rates to generate approximately  million from the fees in addition the statute requires the director of the state department of natural resources to request general revenues or federal funds equal to at least onethird the amount levied against generators vermont a tax on hazardous waste generated in vermont took effect july  to finance a state fund to clean up hazardous waste sites in addition to creating a state superfund the law subjects industries to strict joint and several liability for cleanup costs under the law the state does not have to prove negligence in order to hold a party liable for cleanup costs those responsible for disposal or contamination of any part of a particular site can be held liable for the entire cleanup cost the superfund will be used for remedial action investigations removal of waste spill control and reimbursement of expenses by local governments and others texas a comprehensive program to regulate the disposal of hazardous waste and charge fees for the generation and disposal of hazardous waste was signed into law in texas industry succeeded in securing several provisions such as changes to the permitting process an applicant now only needs one permit for storage processing treatment disposal or destruction of solid or hazardous waste another provision prevents local governments from adopting a rule or ordinance that is inconsistent with the state law age  cma  as a result of the legislation two funds are created in the state treasury  the hazardous waste generation and facility fee fund and the hazardous waste disposal fee fund facility fees are to be set at  per year the generation and facility fund is not to exceed  million a year the hazardous waste disposal fee fund imposes a  per dry weight ton fee on hazardous waste disposal at a land disposal facility the bill however places a s million cap on the fund at the end of a quarter funds collected from the disposal fee are to be appropriated for the statefederal match for cercla and for stateonly cleanup activities public compensation minnesota amendments to the states superfund statute were recently enacted including a  million victims compensation fund among the bills key provisions were o repeal of the causation clause which required a defendant in a toxic tort case to prove that it did not cause the injury o a change in the retroactivity provision for personal liability from january   to july   the date the minnesota superfund law went into effect o repeal of the joint and several liability provision conferees however deleted a provision that would have limited the number of times a party could be found joint and severally liable the victims compensation fund authorized at  million will be financed through general revenues although the state can seek repayment from responsible parties if known victims can recover up to  claims can be submitted for unreimbursed medical expenses loss of wages or loss of household labor the law also provides that survivors can receive up to  a year or  a month additionally persons with contaminated water can recover up to  for cither a new water supply or for decontasiinating existing water resources if there is a decrease in the market value of a principal residence due to contamination a person can recover up to  percent of the loss or  whichever is less in order to achieve the favorable changes in the existing liability provisions industry in minnesota agreed to the compensation fund and strongly supported the bill other states amendments to californias  victim compensation law were also enacted recently these changes moderately expanded the program but did not provide significantly more exposure to the industry activity is still underway in massachusetts where a bill may be considered in the next six months hazardous waste page  cma  michigan in an effort to discourage the use of landfills while promoting alternatives governor james blanchard recently proposed the imposition of a  per ton fee for hazardous waste disposed in landfills beginning in  the fee which could be reduced by  percent if the waste is treated would generate an estimated  million in state revenue which would be applied to additional permit staff and enforcement the proposal would also establish a notification education and inspection program to assist with the disposal for smaller quantities of waste california a report by the states commission for economic development chaired by lt governor mccarthy estimates that it will cost california  billion per year for managing hazardous waste the commissions report proposed the  plan for improving the management of toxic chemicals in california and minimizing long term costs key elements include reducing the volume of waste sent to dumpsites and developing new technology for treating waste additional short term measures recommended by the coimnission include assurance that adequate liability insurance is available for businesses that produce or dispose of hazardous waste tougher drinking water standards for the  most widespread toxic contaminants and increased support for technologies that reduce toxic chemicals in drinking water the commission said it will sponsor or recommend legislation to accomplish the plans objectives one proposal would allow the department of health services to waive state imposed fees onland disposal of hazardous waste up to  per ton for any company that substantially reduces the volume of hazardous waste disposed of in dumps another proposal would create a state certification process for hazardous waste management technologies that are considered economically effective and environmentally safe south carolina governor richard riley recently signed legislation that increased the states contingency fund and placed a fixed limit on the amount to hazardous waste disposed of in the state the legislation more than doubles the fee per ton of hazardous waste disposed of by landfilling or other means of land disposal raising the tax from ton of wastes generated in state to ton for outofstate waste received at a facility the tax increases from ton to  iowa although iowa was one of the first states to receive interim authorization over its hazardous waste program the state has now become the first to voluntarily withdraw this authority with the program reverting back to epa due to severe financial shortfalls in the state the legislature approved an appropriations measure that deletes funding of the hazardous waste program for two years because of this legislation epa found the state lacking authority to administer the program after july  and suspended iowas authority to issue rcra permits iowa will retain authority over the states abandoned and uncontrolled sites used oil site licensing and collection of hazardous waste fees righttoknow state legislation the issues of chemical hazard information disclosure in the workplace and the community and local emergency response page  cma  planning have had a very high profile during the  state legislative sessions through the end of july over  righttoknow bills have been introduced in over  states since most legislatures have adjourned for the year or are in summer recess it is possible to begin to summarize activity in this area to data  states have passed some form of a righttoknow law this year ten of the new laws establish comprehensive worker community andor emergency response programs these laws were enacted in alabama louisiana missouri montana north carolina oregon tennessee texas vermont and west virginia five states have passed laws which add community righttoknow or emergency response requirements to worker righttoknow programs enacted in previous years these are florida illinois maine maryland and washington seven additional states have passed laws which make minor changes to existing righttoknow programs several states meet in yearround sessions of these new jersey is debating community righttoknow legislation california is considering reauthorization of its existing program and michigan is considering a comprehensive law session review the task group is beginning to assess the  state legislative session by reviewing the righttoknow legislation that has been enacted preliminary indications are that the new comprehensive laws passed in  states are generally consistent with cma policy on worker and community righttoknow most of the laws are based on the federal osha standard as they apply to manufacturers and contain community and emergency response requirements which could blend with cmas caer initiatives the task group is developing advocacy documents to be used in the states which incorporate cmas policy in this area an update of the righttoknow state law compilation is also being prepared which will include all new legislation passed in  state litigation court actions are pending in two states as industry begins to force states to recognize the federal osha standard preemption over state law as it applies to manufacturers oral arguments were heard on june  in the appeal of the new jersey decision upholding federal preemption new jersey state chamber of commerce et al v hughey in pennsylvania a group of regional manufacturing associations filed suit on july  asking the us district court to grant an injunction against the state department of labor and industry prohibiting the further implementation and future enforcement of that states worker and community righttoknow law no action has occurred on this suit as yet groundwater ohio the governor recently released a report which defines the administrations goals and objectives for environmental protection and natural resource development high on the governors priority list is the cleanup of contaminated ground and surface water to protect the safety of public and private drinking water it is anticipated that this initiative will be addressed in a bill to be introduced in the general assembly later page  cma  this year separate legislation will be introduced that will focus solely on the protection of groundwater new jersey the new jersey senate energy and environment committee has passed a bill which allows homeowners to petition the state to provide alternative water supplies when wells are contaminated under the legislation a homeowner could also petition the department of environmental protection to test a well for potential contaminants funds for replacing contaminated systems would come from the new jersey spill compensation fund and a  million appropriation from general revenues the new jersey chemical industry council testified on the bill cautioning that spill fund monies should not be used for unnecessary well testing amendments to the bill from the dep are expected other activities members of the hazardous waste groundwater task group recently participated in the national conference of state legislatures annual meeting cmas position papers on groundwater standards and groundwater monitoring were highlighted during a session on leaking underground storage tank discussions in addition task group members and cma staff participated in discussions with the association of washington business on upcoming testimony on proposed drinking water standards transportation new york a legislative package regulating the transportation of hazardous materials in new york failed to gain passage the legislature however approved and sent to the governor a bill to establish a board composed of private and public sector representatives to review certain aspects of the hazardous materials transportation issue the board would make recommendations to the legislature and the governor within a year two cities  denver colorado and columbus ohio  have passed ordinances controlling the shipment of hazardous cargos through their confines denvers city council passed an ordinance which designates routes for class a or b explosives some poison materials organic peroxides and radioactive materials permits as of july  are now required for trucks carrying hazardous materials through the city the cost of the permits will be determined by degree of risk quantities being transported as well as additional factors applicants must designate a specified route for their trip and show proof of liability coverage to get the permits which will last for a year columbus ohio has implemented an ordinance which requires through shipments of hazardous materials to use a bypass around the city and specifies hours of delivery and permits for deliveries of hazardous shipments in the downtown area the city anticipates that there will be limited requests for such permits but the permit mechanism will result in better emergency preparedness since emergency personnel can be better informed of specific shipments of hazardous materials in heavily populated areas hazardous materials transportation members of the task group are age  cma  continuing to work with members of the good samaritan coalition to promote the passage of good samaritan legislation in the states in addition members of the group are working with individual state legislators in new jersey north carolina and georgia to expand existing legislation to cover all hazardous materials not just lp gas toxic air state legislatures the two issues receiving the most scrutiny at the state level in  are acid rain and toxic air contaminants legislation to require an inventory of nitrogen oxide emissions and their effect on the environment was enacted in maine other states which have passed resolutions to study the acid rain issue are minnesota virginia washington massachusetts new hampshire and new york laws which require programs to regulate air toxics were passed in arizona and rhode island and in california a law was enacted which would tax air toxics emissions in order to pay for state regulatory programs hazardous air emission inventories have also been a part of the righttoknow debate at both the state and federal level a comprehensive righttoknow law recently enacted in west virginia includes provisions which require certain manufactures to consolidate all federal state and local air emissions permits and provide them to the state in florida legislation was passed which requires air emissions inventories and in illinois a bill to inventory emissions of  chemicals was narrowly defeated in the closing days of the session state regulation programs to regulate toxic air contaminants are being developed and implemented in nearly  states connecticut continues to work on its final draft plan and vermont has recently released its plan to regulate hazardous air contaminants industry groups are closely monitoring these activities strategy development in conjunction with the environmental management committees focus on a cma air toxics work plan the state affairs toxic air task group is preparing strategies to work the issue in the states a system is being established to closely monitor the legislative and regulatory activities in specific highpriority states and the task group is being expanded to include member companies with activities in these states comnunication programs will be developed which can be used to advocate cma policies at the state level through member companies and chemical industry councils the task group is also working with various technical task groups to integrate state legislative and regulatory perspectives into cmas toxic air pollutant program specific chemical research and advocacy advocacy highlights allyl chloride the program panel decided to disband after  years of activities the panel undertook toxicologic research projects to evaluate toxicity potential and submitted research reports to government  cma  agencies regulation by epa is possible under the clean air act however because of low toxicity and exposure potentials the agency has placed allyl chloride at a very low priority the panel may reconvene when the agency initiates activities on the chemical dibenzofuransdibenzodioxins the dfdx panel submitted comments to epa on plans for a tsca section  monitoring test rule while the panel informed epa that it questions the agencys authority to require manufacturers to analyze products for trace contaminants they indicated a willingness to cooperate to develop a reasonable test rule the panel advocated the need for an analytical round robin to demonstrate reasonable analytical parameters for a test rule the panels analytical task group then met with epa technical staff to discuss the comments the proposed rule is scheduled to be published by epa in november  dow chemical company hosted an educational seminar for the dfdx panel and task group members in midland michigan various representatives from dow chemical company and monsanto company presented the latest information on the health and environmental effects and the fate and environmental sources of dioxins and furans tours of dows analytical and toxicology laboratories were also arranged for the attendees the seminar was extremely successful and provided the panel with a technical base from which to develop its comments on various epa proceedings ethylhexanoic acid the eha panel submitted comments on the proposed test rule on ethylhexanoic acid the rule proposed subchronic developmental and pharmacokinetics testing based upon concern that dermal exposure might occur during processing eha is used solely as an intermediate in the synthesis of other chemicals and is manufactured and consumed entirely in enclosed systems the panel contented that exposure to eha is so limited that there is no likelihood that eha could pose a significant risk to workers regardless of the outcome of the proposed testing to obtain additional information on potential exposure the panel is sponsoring a survey of users the panel also consented on the rationale for requiring testing stating that the subchronic and developmental testing is unjustified and the pharmacokinetics testing is needed only if effects are found in other tests finally the panel recommends streamlining the proposed pharmacokinetics testing to provide data in a more timely and costefficient fashion fluorocarbons in june the companies supporting the fluorocarbon program approved a  million budget for calendar year  this is a  increase over the  budget also in june the panel released revision  of its summary research program on effect of chlorofluorocarbons on the atmosphere this annual publication details all research funded by the panel in its thirteenyear history age  cma  l in august the panel submitted comments to epa on four draft documents prepared as part of the environmental impact statement on the effect of control measures for the protection of the ozone layer epa and the department of state are conducting the eis as background to the us position on activities under the unep convention for the protection of the ozone layer in addition a unep resolution calling for further study to address both short and longterm strategies is being implemented a unep steering committee meeting is planned for september   in london to organize workshops to be held within the next year glycol ethers a work group of the glycol ethers panel met with epa staff to address remaining technical concerns with industry data submitted in response to a tsca section  anpr on diethylene glycol butyl ether and its acetate epa plans to announce its decision on testing needs in the fall and a federal register notice is expected in spring  the national toxicology program has three glycol ethers and their respective acetates under review as candidate chemicals for testing in the program the panel is maintaining a close liaison with ntp and will attempt to establish a cmantp work group if the chemicals are recommended for testing by the ntp executive committee three triethylene glycol ethers appeared on the th interagency testing committee list of priority chemicals recommended for testing under tsca section a panel members attended the epa public focus meeting and presently are involved in informationgathering it is possible that the panel will sponsor dermal absorption studies on these compounds in advance of an epa test rule proposal i ketones the ketones panel members met with epa scientists in june to discuss differences in interpretation of the mutagenicity test data on mek and mik gathered as part of a negotiated testing agreement the panel considers the ten mutagenicity tests to indicate no need for further testing on the two compounds extensive comments backing the panels position were filed with the agency the epa will respond by the end of this year methylenedianiline the mda panel submitted comments on oshas draft federal register notice announcing the agencys plans to form a negotiated rulemaking consoittee on mda osha intends to establish a committee under the federal advisory committee act to negotiate issues leading to a proposed rulemaking on mda the committee is to include representatives of the parties interested in or affected by the outcome of the rulemaking naphthenates the naphthenates panel completed the first phase of  its dermal absorption study on lead and cobalt naphthenates the results have been submitted to epa under a  agreement with the agency the panel and epa will discuss the need for additional testing in the near future octylphenol the panel is reviewing epas comnents on a protocol for an aquatic chronic effects study of octylphenol in rainbow trout the panel intends to start testing within the next several weeks age  cma  oleylamine the panel recently completed a mutagenicity test on oleylamine and found the chemical to be devoid of mutagenic potential in this test system the report of the panelsponsored research was submitted to relevant agencies phosgene representatives of the phosgene panels engineering and safety practices task group met with the department of energy and their contractor lawrence livermore laboratory to discuss conducting an air dispersion study of phosgene the panel is interested in using the does new liquefied gaseous fuels spill test facility to evaluate various mitigation devices for accidental phosgene releases and to assess different air dispersion models currently available the facility is being constructed at the doe nevada test site phthalate esters on behalf of the phthalate esters panel dr joseph rodricks of environ corporation mr derek till of arthur d little inc and dr bernard astill of eastman kodak company made presentations to the chronic hazard advisory panel of the consumer product safety commission the scientists addressed three key issues concerning the health effects of dehp  toxicology exposure and risk assessment dr rodricks a leading expert in risk assessment concluded that the individual lifetime risk associated with dehpcontaining childrens products is probably less than one in one hundred million according to mr till adl concluded that while the cpsc exposure study is a useful contribution to the literature it is inadequate to form the basis for an exposure assessment dr astill emphasized that there is overwhelming evidence that dehp is not a genotoxic material subsequently the chap completed its draft report on dehp and released it for public comment the report concludes that dehp is a nongenotoxic carcinogen with induction of peroxisomes as its probable mechanism of action this mechanism while not proven would result in a threshold of exposure to dehp below which there is no risk the chap recommended that research on mechanism of action and exposure continue the phthalate esters panel decided not to proceed with the second phase of its environmental effects testing program which was part of the  negotiated testing agreement with epa the panel decision resulted from a meeting with the epa test rules development branch trdb in may trdb said that it did not intend to review the panels phase i proposal before fall  furthermore the agency revealed an intention to publish a proposed test rule on butyl benzyl phthalate in october the proposed rule will prescribe substantially more testing than was agreed to in the negotiated testing agreement the additional testing would include all studies that are required to establish a water quality standard on bbp in a letter to epa assistant administrator dr john moore the panel stated that it is concerned that epa might adopt a similar approach on other pes efforts to perform further environmental testing are therefore suspended until the situation is clarified titanium dioxide the national cancer institute has begun a feasibility

establish scientific criteria for identifying and classifying carcinogens mutagens and teratogens the group met first in april  in brussels and subsequently in washington in june to produce harmonized criteria for identifying such chronic hazards preliminary presentations of this tripartite agreement in its draft form were given to the science advisory soard to epa and to the office of management and budget following ratification hy the sponsoring organizations this document will be presented formally to the respective government agencies the iag will continue to work with its european canadian and japanese counterparts to bring about a better understanding of and scientific consensus on important future health safety and environmental issues cma  iags major accomplishments in  o joint iagjcia meeting on september  and th the international affairs group met with representatives of jcia chemical safety control committee cscc at the latters tokyo offices for iag this was the second of three such meetings this year with chemical industry trade associations of other countries these meetings addressed issues arising from th laws and regulations intended to reduce chemical risks to health safety and the environment iag and jcia had earlier exchanged discussion papers on each issue these included current status and proposed changes in tsca and in japans chemical substance control law chemical inventories testing of new and existing substances labeling protection of confidential information specific chemical identity of substances and issues involving the export and import of hazardous substances particularly as proposed in the oecd recommendation and unep provisional notification scheme were also topics of exchanges between the two groups usjapan activities to implement oecd recommendations on good laboratory practices were discussed the effect of us rightco know laws as these interact with labeling and confidentiality und r osha and tsca were also topics of discussion the meeting achieved the following agreed to implement oecds good laboratory practices identified differences between jcia and iag interpretations of draft proposals of oecds guides to traders and manufacturers in the export of hazardous substances jcia and iag agreed to work together to resolve these differences within the framework of oecds business and industry advisory council o joint iagacic meeting the iag met in canberra australia on september  and   with members of the australian chemical industry council acic discussions were focused on australias proposed law to implement the notification and assessment scheme for new chemicals representatives from two australian state governments victoria and new south wales also participated in the meetings the australian government has announced that mandatory nationwide notification and assessment for chemicals new to australia would be implemented by july  the scheme is patterned on the eec sixth amendm nt the prospective manufacturerimporter of a new chemical is required t provide information similar to that specified for premarket notifications in eec during the course of the meeting the iag delegation mentioned many concerns and problems with the proposed australian legislation as a direct result of these discussi ns the australian government has agreed to seriously review and modify their legislative initiative and the implementation of that legislation has been significantly delayed cma  the acic and iag agreed on the need to protect confidentiality of trade secret chemical identities of substances and the group agreed to review implementation of the principles of good laboratory practice worker and community righttoknow laws and the exchange of information on the export of hazardous substances o joint iagccpa meeting on  and  may  the iag met with the canadian chemical producers association in toronto canada the format for the meeting was that of a regularly scheduled ccpa meeting where iag invited guests were asked to comment where appropriate the discussion lasted for two days and included a a complete presentation of the canadian workplace hazardous materials information system whmis policy framework and review of the status of the united states occupational safety  health administration osha proposal b discussion of risk assessment and risk management legislation c discussions of testing and notification as they appear in the environmental containments act in canada d export notification from both the united states and canadian perspectives e regulation of substances in canada f discussion of the otadeveloped caes and nchxc programs how the caes and ncsxc programs complement those now being implemented in canada and g discussion of the tripartite iagceficccpa working group on chronic hazards xt was agreed that iag and its members would review the whmxs ingredient disclosure list exchange key axhc documents on risk assessment keep ccpa advised on reauthorization of the us toxic substances control act and assist in obtaining full reciprocity in the  s for canadian tdg segulations o joint iagceficccpa working group on chronic hazards as a result of extensive discussions between the three organize tions it was agreed that a group of environmental and health and safety experts would convene in april  in brussels to lay out a set of common definitions of chronic hazards that effort produced remarkably good agreement and the first of international stature on the environmental health or safety issues involved a subsequent meeting in june in washington resolved technical differences within the group and by the end of august  the joint iagcepicccpa tripartite agreement should be ratified by the sponsoring organiza tions and be ready for publication cma  copies of this document will be sent to appropriate us governmental agencies and to the various governmental agencies within the european economic community as well as to the canadian agencies responsible for health safety and the environment o iag prepared and delivered position papers on information exchange for export of hazardous substances through the u s business and industry advisory committee and the u s state department to the organization for economic cooperation and development chemicals group and its parent environment committee iag has supported the purposes of the oecd chemicals progranun  that is to harmonize chemicals regulation in member countries in an effort to avoid trade barriers that may be caused by inconsistent laws and regulations we have however opposed efforts by some officials in the oecd secretariat and member governments to turn the programme into an international regulatory system we have also urged implementation of the past chemicals programme activity into national regulatory schemes prior to initiation of any new areas of involvement from oecd most oecd countries are just beginning to develop their toxic substances control legislation and time is needed for them to implement their own systems and to assimilate existing oecd guidelines before any additional substantive oecd activities are undertaken iag believ s that an international agreement or treaty on chemicals control is premature iag is increasingly looked to by the js government and by the oecd as the key voice representing us industry on a continuing basis iag closely follows the agenda of oecds chemicals group management committee and their various expert groups consulting as necessary with the official us delegation to register us industrys views on key technical issues o the iag has participated in an increased dialogue with various lem nts of the united nations specifically comments were submitted on uneps provisional notification guidelines on the export of hazardous substances the state department has accepted our views that listing banned severely restricted withdrawn or unapproved in the case of pharmaceuticals chemicals is an inappropriate mechanism and that thes terms are faulty without further definition an ad hoc task group of iag has extensively researched pros and cons of participation in a jointly sponsored unepunctc conference proposed for late  on the health and safety aspects of transnational corporations chemical operations in developing countries the task group has met with representatives of the state department cbfic and people from the corporate comnunity to discuss whether iag should participate as unctc has requested or to join a umbrella organization such as the international chamber of commerce and attend under their ngo status or to withdraw from par ticipation entirely it is expected that this question will be resolved within the next thirty days irrespective of the outcome however the iag will continue to improve its liaison with organizations of the united nations and with those elements in the private sector dealing on a more direct basis with th un groups cma cma  exhibit i acanada bilateral trade agreement proposed cma position gacx ground several years ago the canadian government expressed interest in that proposal contained j ninber of industrial sectors including petrochemicals the cma international trade conmittee held several meetings with the canadian chmical producers association ccfa trade conmittee during  and  following those meetings concern was expressed that a productbyproduct or sectoral approach would probably not meet with acceptance by the us chemical industry the trudeau canadian government did not make a formal request to the united states to enter into negotiations  tons of bilateral free trade with the us the mulroney canadian government is also interested in such a trade negotiation with the united states however the canadians apparently have come to believe that only an acrosstheboard approach not a sectoral approach will receive consideration by the js government in anticipation of a canadian overture for a bilateral negotiation the cma international trade committee has prepared the attached proposed position statement reconmend ation that the following specific conditions be met in order for any bilateral trade agreement to exist between the two countries these conditions would include t o a o o o balanced benefits to both countries canadian government policies which do not unduly restrict investment or feedstock availability and price tariff reductions across the board rather than sectoral basis adequate dispute settlement procedures and a requirement for  percent canadian value added for all eligible goods action required approval of reconmended position cma  approved international trade committee  cma statement of key principles concerning a bilateral free trade agreement between the united states and canada any bilateral free trade agreement must confer balanced benefits to both the united states and canada negotiations on the elimination of preferential canadian chemical feedstock and energy policies and foreign investment restrictions must be an integral part of any us tariff negotiations with canada in this regard the us government must not commit itself to any tariff cuts prior to obtaining canadian agreement to eliminate these nontariff trade and investment barriers other nontariff trade barriers such as inadequate protection of intellectual property rights should also be considered in any free trade negotiations between the united states and canada the tariff elimination components of a bilateral free trade agreement between the united states and canada should include all chemicals and related products and should not be restricted to chemical industry subsectors or specific products the us government should consult with the us chemical industry and provide adequate opportunities for timely industry input before and during us negotiations with canada any free trade agreement should require that all products eligible for dutyfree entry into the united states under the agreement must have a canadian value added level of  percent or greater with an unlimited allowance permitted for the value of us components a bilateral free trade agreement with canada should provide for the mandatory reimposition of duties in the event of nonfulfillment of the conditions of the agreement any bilateral free trade agreement with canada should contain an adequate and binding dispute settlement mechanism free trade negotiations with canada should also address other issues such as how temporary trade distortions caused by currency fluctuations and injury to a domestic industry by dutyfree entry of products will be handled to avoid impairment of the benefits under any bilateral free trade agreement cma  chemical manufacturers association comments on a bilateral free trade agreement between the united states and canada executive summary the following comments of the chemical manufacturers association cma on a possible bilateral free trade agreement between the united states and canada present issues which cma believes must be addressed by the united states prior to entering into any such agreement first cma believes that any bilateral free trade agreement  must confer balanced benefits to both the united states and canada one country must not benefit to the detriment of the other second cma believes that the longterm objective of such a free trade agreement is to achieve an open environment for international trade and investment unencumbered by barriers and governmental intervention in the marketplace in this regard we believe that any free trade agreement must address nontariff barriers to trade for example we believe that negotiations on the elimination of preferential canadian chemical feedstock and energy policies and foreign investment restrictions must be an integral part of any us free trade negotiations with canada cma  moreover we believe that other nontariff trade barriers such as inadequate protection of intellectual property rights should also be considered in any free trade negotiations between the two countries cma is aware that the administration is evaluating the merits of the possible establishment of a subsectoral free trade arrangement with canada on petrochemicals moreover the canadian chemical industry has proposed that any such negotiations address only certain products in the petrochemical subsector cma is opposed to any chemical industry product or subsectoral approach instead we believe that any tariff negotiations with canada coupled as indicated above with negotiations on nontariff barriers must address all chemicals and related products to ensure the effectiveness of the tariff elimination component of a free trade agreement with canada any such agreement should require that all products eligible for dutyfree entry into the united states under the agreement have a canadian value added level of at least  percent of the value of the product the value of us origin raw materials or other components incorporated into a canadian product in canada should be considered canadian value added for purposes of the  percent test cma  moreover cma believes that a free trade agreement with canada should provide for the reimposition of duties in the  event of nonfulfillment of agreement conditions address oth r issues such as how temporary trade distortions caused by currency fluctuations and injury to a domestic industry by dutyfree entry of products will be handled and contain an adequate and binding dispute settlement mechanism the dispute settlement provisions contained in the usisraeli agreement are not adequate in our opinion finally cma believes that it is absolutely essential that r the us administration provide adequate and timely opportunities for chemical industry input before undertaking any free trade negotiations with canada as well as during any negotiation process cma urges the utilization of the industry sector advisory committee isac for this process however we believe that other industry groups such as our own association must also be included in this consultative process cma believes that if the issues discussed in our comments are considered by the united states government before negotiations with canada begin and if they are adequately addressed in any free trade agreement with canada then trade benefits mutually advantageous to both countries are achievable through such an agreement cma  chemical manufacturers association comments on a bilateral free trade agreement betweeen the united states and canada introduction the united states and canadian governments are considering the desirability of a bilateral free trade agreement between the two countries as a part of this analysis the united states international trade commission usitc and the interagency trade policy staff committee tpsc are currently investigating the probable economic effect of providing dutyfree treatment for selected imports from canada the results of these investigations are intended to assist the president in assessing the impact of establishing bilateral free trade in selected industry subsectors including certain petrochemicals the chemical manufacturers association wishes to make the following comments on a bilateral free trade agreement between the united states and canada the chemical manufacturers association cma is a nonprofit trade association whose member companies represent more than  percent of the productive capacity of basic industrial chemicals in the united states the comments contained in this paper are not directed to aither the usitc or the tpsc investigation rather they present issues which cma believes must be addressed by the us government prior to entering into any bilateral free trade agreement with canada cma  general comments the united states and canada are each others largest trading partner the total trade between the two countries in  equalled  billion chemical trade represents a substantial portion of this figure in  canadian chemical exports to the united states were about  billion and united states chemical exports to canada totalled  billion this reflects a  chemical trade balance of about  million in the chemical industry of each country has substantial direct investment in the other country in many cases canadian subsidiaries of us companies produce intermediate or finished products not only for the canadian market but also for the united states and third country markets in addition the strengths of the us and canadian chemical industries complement each other canada has a rich base in natural resources especially in hydrocarbons with installed capacity for large volumes of certain basic chemicals and inter mediates the united states has a highly developed basic chemical and downstream chemical processing industry as well as capacity to produce a variety of commodity chemicals the united us dept of commerce bureau of census highlights of us export and import trade ft december  cma  states also has the worlds largest market for products of the chemical industry iii specific comments any bilateral free trade agreement must confer balanced benefits to both the united states and canada cma believes that the benefits of any bilateral agreement must be evenhanded one country must not benefit to the detriment of the other the statutory authorityfor such agreements supports this contention section  of the trade act of  as amended by section  of the trade and tariff act of  indicates that such negotiations should be conducted on the basis of mutuality moreover the legislative history of the  act states the intention of congress that bilateral agreements of the sort proposed with canada must be reciprocal and mutually advantageous   as amended by section a  of the trade and tariff cma  any free trade agreement with canada must address nontariff barriers to trade negotiations on the elimination of preferential canadian chemical feedstock and energy policies and foreign investment restrictions must be an integral part of any free trade negotiations with canada cma believes that the negotiations between the united states and canada on a bilateral free trade agreement should not be limited to the subject of tariffcutting the elimination of trade distortions caused by preferential canadian chemical feedstock and energy policies and by canadian foreign investment restrictions must also be adequately addressed in such negotiations furthermore we believe that the us gov rnment must not commit itself to eliminating any tariffs prior to obtaining canadian agreement to eliminate the trade distorting effects of these restrictive policies ample support for the inclusion of nontariff barriers in such negotiations is found in the trade act of  and the trade and tariff act of   sections a  and  of the trade act of   cma  canadian raw material and energy policies cma believes that the internal energy policies implemented under the canadian national energy policy cnep have had an adverse effect on market mechanisms in canada and on canadian trade with the united states in energyrelated products such as chemicals we understand that the cnep is under review by the canadian government and is likely to be changed in any case as part of a bilateral free trade agreement we urge that the united states government ensure that present and future canadian governments feedstock supply price and access policies do not serve as a barrier to otherwise fair competition this is necessary to avoid the creation or perpetuation of an artificial advantage for the producers of one country over those of the other such an assurance is particularly important to industries such as the petrochemical industry for which feedstock pricing and availability are critical because the cost of feedstocks represents the largest element of cost for many petrochemical products if the trade distorting effects of the canadian governments policies with respect to the supply and price of and access to petrochemical feedstocks are not neutralized then those canadian policies will largely determine the conditions of competition in international trade in petrochemicals between the united states and canada undermining the workings of an open market system cma  canadian investment policy the united states government must address differences in investment policy between the united states and canada to ensure that us companies wishing to invest in the canadian chemical industry are not subject to different or more stringent requirements than are canadian investors in canada in  a general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt panel found the canadian foreign investment review act fira to be in violation of gatt article iii because fira made approval to e invest in canada contingent upon a foreign investors acceptance of often onerous performance requirements to which domestic canadian investors were not subject we understand that the canadian government has begun to administer fira in a less restrictive manner and that the canadian parliament has passed the investment canada act as firas replacement  while this new legislation is supposed to liberalize the requirements imposed on foreign investors s v ral restrictions will remain especially on foreign acquisitions of existing canadian companies it remains to be seen how the new act will be implemented general agreement on tariffs and trade report of the panel canadaadministration of the foreign investment review introduced in the house of commons on december   cma  in any event cma urges the united states government to seek the elimination of discriminatory canadian investment restrictions other than those dealing with national security prior to finalizing a tariffcutting agreement with canada other nontariff trade barriers such as inadequate protection of intellectual property rights should also be considered in any free trade negotiations between the united states and canada there is growing recognition in the united states and abroad that the effective protection of intellectual property rights is essential to increased innovation and productivity and is a vital part of international trade decisions provisions aimed at encouraging such protection in other countries are contained in the trade and tariff act of   the topic is being included in numerous bilateral trade and investment negotiations and efforts are underway by some industry groups to have intellectual property rights included in a new round of multilateral trade negotiations in this context cma urges the united states government to address the issue of protection of intellectual property rights as part of any free trade negotiations with canada canada has traditionally recognized the importance of providing such and tarilacto   stat    and  cma  protection however some problem areas remain for example in the pharmaceutical field we believe that a free trade agreement with canada should include a resolution of these issues as well as provisions eliminating any other nontariff trade barriers that may exist the tariff elimination components of a free trade agreement with canada must be efective the tariff elimination components of a bilateral free trade aqreementetween the united statesand canada skould include all chemicals and related products and not be restricted to chemical industry subsectorsor specific products a key issue in the uscanada negotiations is whether import duties or tariffs will be eliminated across the board or only on specific industry sectors subsectors or products cma is opposed to any chemical industry product or subs ctoral approach instead we believe that tariff negotiations with canada must address all chemicals and related products we believe such broader negotiations offer greater potential for mutual trade benefits cma  any free trade agreement with canada should require that all products eligible for dutyfree entry into the united states underthe agreement must have a canadian value added level incluctinqr the value of us origin components of at least  percent of the value of the product a minimum level of canadian value added must be a condition for dutyfree entry into the united states under a bilateral free trade agreement with canada this criterion would be fully consistent with the goal of enhanced uscanadian trade and would help to prevent potential abuses of a special trade relationship through transshipment practices the value added threshold must be high enough to prevent products of third countries being passed through canada to the united states after only formulation or minor finishing operations have been performed in canada cma urges that the minimum domestic canadian value added b set at  percent of the appraised value of the product at the time of entry rather them the  percent required under the generalized system of preferences the caribbean basin economic recovery act and the proposed bilateral free trade agreement with israel a higher percentage is necessary in an agreement with canada because canada is not a developing country and should not be given the liberal domestic value added requirements that have been granted as a concession to such countries in addition cma recommends that the value of us origin raw materials or other components incorporated into a canadian product in canada be considered to be canadian value added for purposes of the  percent test to promote bilateral trade cma  a free trade agreement with canada should provide for the mandatory reimposition of duties in theevent of nonfulfillment of the conditions of the agreement any uscanada bilateral free trade agreement should include a snapback provision under which united states import duties eliminated under the agreement automatically return to column  rates if the conditions of the free trade agreement are no longer fulfilled for example if investment restrictions were reimposed by canada or if canada imposed a new nontariff barrier to us exports then the duties on imports from canada should snapback free trade negotiations with canada should also address other issues such as how temporary trade distortions caused by currency fluctuations and injury to a domestic industry by dutvree entry of products will be handled to avoid impairment of the benefits under any bilateral free trade agreement two difficult subjects that cma believes must also b addressed in the context of bilateral free trade negotiations with canada are how to handle temporary trade distortions caused by currency fluctuations and what to do if a domestic industry is injured by the dutyfree entry of products under an agreement consideration should be given to imposition of a surcharge to correct the temporary trade distortions in the first instance and to imposition of temporary safeguard duties to eliminate the injury in the second in this regard cma assumes the us unfair trade statutes will continue to apply to imports fr m canada cma  any bilateral free trade agreement with canada should contain an adequate and binding dispute settlement mechanism cma believes that any bilateral free trade agreement with canada should contain procedures for the settlement of disputes between canada and the united states that arise under the agreement we do not believe that the procedures contained in the proposed usisraeli agreement are adequate for this purpose instead we recommend that dispute settlement procedures in any uscanada agreement settlement of disputes provide for a rapid and effectiv contain mechanisms for a binding decision in the event of a stalemate and most importantly provide for significant industry input in the dispute settlement process the us government should consult with the us chemical industry and provide adequate opportunities for timely industry input before and during us negotiations with canada as mandated by the trade act of  and reaffirmed in th trade agreements act of   a structure of formal industry sector advisory committees isacs representing us companies from all segments of us business is in place there is a as amended bv section  of the trade agreements act of  jrstat jdfiilo cma  widespread perception that the isacs were not advised or consulted adequately in the course of developing the usisrael free trade agreement nor in earlier and subsequent us government discussions with mexico which led to the signing o the usmexican subsidies agreement cma strongly urges the us government to avail itself fully of this mechanism for eliciting private sector input on a timely basis if any consultations on a uscanada bilateral agreement proceed moreover we believe that appropriate mechanisms must exist to allow for additional industry input such as from cma and other trade associations into any such negotiations so that all significant considerations can be addressed prior to any commitments having been made conclusion cma believes that if the issues raised in this paper are considered by the united states government before negotiations with canada begin and are adequately addressed in any free trade agreement with canada then trade benefits mutually advantageous to both countries are achievable through such an agreement cma cma  r exhibit ji i review of cma groundwater program amd proposed policy on groundwater protection  i  this presentation is intended to review the development of cmas groundwater program and to request approval of one new element of oias evolving groundwater policy groundwater is an important natural resource it has many and varied uses including drinking water supplies crop irrigation livestock watering and industrial water supplies approximately  of all americans obtain all or part of their drinking water from groundwater sources recently groundwater issues have come to the forefront many groundwater issues are or soon will be before congress epa state legislatures and regulatory agencies and on the agendas of environmental groups industry groups and consensus organizations  o senator durenberger is currently holding oversight hearings on groundwater senator durenberger will introduce groundwater

human health and aquatic resources elements and status of cma groundwater policy cma is developing a comprehensive groundwater management policy which addresses federal and state legislative and regulatory responsibilities cmas position on the federalstate split continues to be that o states should have responsibility for defining implementing and enforcing groundwater management programs o the federal government should provide guidance technical transfer and funds to aid states in their efforts cmas groundwater management policy will address all critical aspects of the groundwater issue these aspects include groundwater standards monitoring use classification groundwater protection and product handling cma actions t date are summarized in table i proposed groundwater protection

resources have historically and appropriately been the responsibility of state and local governments in view of tha localized nature of groundwatar use and the land use considerations tied so closely to groundwater management states continue to be best suited to develop and implement groundwater management program some states have designed or are in the process of designing programs tailored to meet their specific needs and considerations cma encourages all states to develop such program in developing groundwater quality protection programs cma believes that states should consider instituting performance requirements for each facility that will minimise the release of pollutants groundwater protection practices also cma realizes that statss may choose to institute one or more of the following practices as part of the groundwater management prograt a a groundwater withdrawal program to protect groundwater quality b land use planning in areas where the potential for adverse impacts from groundwatar contamination from future activities are significant and c a permit program for point source discharges to groundwater where such dischargus are not already controlled under

groundwater quality and of minimising the potential for groundwater dischargee cma  from ill source such practices should be developed by the affected facility be implemented on a facilityspecific basis and include the concept of hydrogeologic vulnerability surveillance programs should be instituted where necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the specific protection practice in addition a gpp should include educational and training programs for those responsible for implementation gpps should address current and planned activities and should be documented they should also include any necessary plots plans drawings or maps in addition the gpp plan should be modified whenever changes at a facility materially increase the potential for significant releases of pollutants or where actual releases indicate the plan is inadequate where states opt to include gpps as part of their groundwater quality protection program such practices could include an inspection provision and trigger mechanism for more detailed plan review when discharges occur the federal government should assist states in developing gpp requirements by providing guidance and technical assistance and by creating the opportunity for information exchange this would assist states in determining the most effective approaches consistent with their specific needs absent regulatory requirements groundwater protection practices are still an appropriate and necessary procedure for those whose land surface activities could affect groundwater quality other state considerations improper withdrawal of

toxicity study of rats exposed to hydroquinone were submitted to epa testing was conducted at eastman kodaks health and environmental laboratories ketones epas office of toxic substances has issued a final rule requiring testing of mesityl oxide under tsca section a the agency is page  cma  requiring a mutagenicity battery and day subchronic study a positive result in one of the mutagenicity tests would trigger highertiered mutagenicity testing and an oncogenicity study all manufacturers including manufacturers of mo as a nonisolated intermediate and processors are subject to the test rule epa also considers exposure to mo in pesticide formulation to be a tsca concern concurrent with the publication of the final rule epa issued a proposed rule on testing guidelines for the research required in the test rule comments are due to epa by february   the ketones panel will meet this month to review the final rule and develop comments in response to the proposed test standards lubricant additives an organizational meeting of companies interested in forming a lubricant additives program was held at cma on october   attendees included members of an ad hoc group of lubricant additives manufacturers who organized under cmas distribution committee to address forthcoming pollution control regulations by the international maritime organization the groups interests expanded to discussion of the point where sponsorship of environmental effects testing to support proper shipping classification of the additives cma has responded favorably to the request to establish a special program the lubricant additives panel will sponsor an aquatic toxicity testing program and incorporate other activities of the ad hoc group meetings of the panel and environmental research task group are scheduled this month methylenedianlline the mda panel sponsored a oneday seminar for mda user representatives the seminar resulted in general support for expanding the panel to serve as the

validation and mitigation devices phthalate esters the consumer product safety commission released te final report of its chronic hazard advisory panel chap on diethylhexyl phthalate dehp in childrens products the chap report concluded that while dehp is an animal carcinogen it is not genotoxic does not damage dma and the most likely mechanism of action involves a threshold phenomenon in addition the chap concluded that existing exposure data are inadequate to permit an accurate estimate of risk finally the chap suggested that additional research is necessary to accurately assess effects of dehp on humans following release of the report the commission met on december   to consider regulatory action of dehp in childrens products the toy manufacturers of america proposed a voluntary standard on dehp levels in pacifiers the commission agreed to pursue the voluntary standard and meet again in march  to review the progress of standard development the phthalate esters panel will also participate in the standard development process the phthalate esters panel has formed a new work group as part of the panels fda task group the new exposure work group will develop a program that will supplement fda food analysis activities concerning phthalates the society of the plastics industry will actively participate in this effort the fda is analyzing milk and beer samples to determine representative dehp levels the exposure work group has proposed a program that will test three food types milk cheese and meat six locations in the united states will be selected and six products in each food type will be collected from every location dehp levels will be measured in each food sample fda agreed to participate by identifying the appropriate food brands and locations for collection if fda concurs totally with the proposal testing should begin in february  the phthalate esters panel filed comments on the tsca section  proposed test rule on butyl benzyl phthalate bbp which were prepared in conjunction with the cma environmental management committee since bbp is also on epas priority pollutant list the agency is requiring under this rule all the testing necessary to develop a water quality criteria standard the panel commented that the existing data base on bbp may page  cma s present an unreasonable risk of injury the panel also feels that epa cannot use data needs for the clean water act to justify testing under section  of tsca finally the panels comments point out that the epa requirements for water quality criteria are excessive and that the standard test battery should be reduced to reflect the stateoftheart in environmental testing the panels comments were also presented to epa at a public meeting on the proposed rule on november  the panel and the emc will continue to work with the water office to develop a more appropriate testing approach the phthalate esters panel also provided epa with comments on the final report on a ranking system for a list of priority pollutants dated august  the report will be the basis for potential removal of chemicals from epas water priority pollutant list the industry has a vital interest in the content and eventual application of the report since any chemical can be listed or delisted as a priority pollutant epa plans to announce its final procedures in may  polychlorinated biphenyls the panel is continuing efforts towards the development of a national standar for addressing pcb spills various meetings were held with representatives from the national electrical manufacturers association the edison electric institute the natural resources defense council and the environmental defense fund the panel has begun developing its strategy for addressing epas initiatives to bring pcb regulations

the washington based lobbying efforts on superfund reauthorizatibn most of this work is being page  cma   dona through the network of constitutent contacts developed over the last two years as superfund legislation moved through the house and senate the grassroots program continued to request letters and telephone calls from constituents to legislators the message delivered to the legislators continued to reflect the latest legislative developments the response to request for letters telephone calls and visits was outstanding it appears that most companies made every effort to contact a maximum number of congressmen followup letters thanking those congressmen who supported cma were also requested each grassroot manager was given the voting record on the major amendments debate by the full house as needed the grassroots program will lobby congressmen and senators involved in the conference committee on superfund in january a letter from the cma chairman of the board george sella of american cyanamid will be sent to each cma member company requesting increased and new participation in the grassroots program there will be a meeting of existing and new grassroots managers in february  this meeting is designed to introduce all grassroots managers to the grassroots program background information on the new grassroots issues of the clean air act and groundwater will also be discussed following the february meeting companies grassroots managers will be asked to identify constituents living in key congressional districts or states these contacts will act as

imposed numerous additional requirements for continued tax qualification of pension and profitsharing plans the irs has not yet issued regu lations implementing all th new legislation and regulations that have been issued have not yet been finalized congress also may enact new cma  f  legislation changing the requirements for maintenance of tax qualified status because it is as yet unclear what requirements must be met in order to maintain taxqualified status under the new tax laws irs may request additional amendments to the plans during the determination letter process additional amendments may also be needed to comply with any future changes in the tax laws accordingly an expeditious method of amending the h plan and the pension plan to maintain tax qualified status is needed at its october   meeting the cma employee benefits committee directed staff and pension counsel to prepare a resolution for board approval to expand the authority of the president to make such changes recommendation that the president be granted authority on advice of pension counsel to authorized amendments to cmas qualified plans to the  extent necessary to maintain their qualified status such amendments would be subsequently reported to the employee benefits committee and board for review i action requested approval of recommendation and resolution c attachments cma cma  exhibit i proposed mtn position background the administration has moved strongly to counter congressional anger about import competition and foreign markets closed to us exports the president proposed on september  a long list of things he will do administratively and requests he will make of the congress for legislation among the proposals will be a request for authorization of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations mtns under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt important sections of the business conanunity and the farmers have been pressuring the administration for such broad scale bargaining for several years it is essential they believe to resolve serious trade problems they have on a worldwide basis in anticipation of this the presidents trade representative has strongly promoted a new mtn like the kennedy round of the s and tokyo round of the s with other countries it now appears that enough gatt members agree and the president needs to prove his commitment by obtaining congressional approval to proceed key bills in the senate and house have an mtn authorization provision they will be taken up early in  recommendation the cma international trade consnittee seeks to emphasize three issues in a new mtn intellectual property rights investment policy and tariff cutting with a position already approved by the board on the first two issues approval of a tariff cutting policy was requested the board on september  the proposal was tabled without prejudice to allow the itc to revise it after reviewing comments by board members the resulting proposed policy and statement of principles is attached it calls for a sound us negotiating policy a better gatt dispute settlement procedure limited tariff cutting and resolution of investment and intellectual property rights difficulties in other countries a copy of the full recosnended itc policy is a attached action required  approval of attached position cma cma  chemical manufacturers association statement of principles concerning united states participation in a new round of multilateral trade negotiations mtn under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in  the united states and other gatt signatories are expected to enter into a new round of mtn in an effort to further expand world trade cma believes the new round should address a number of issues which are crucial to the long range competitive position of the us chemical industry the emphasis should not be on simply cutting tariffs but rather on efforts to eliminate existing trade barriers these trade barriers include foreign market access certain tariffs trade distorting foreign investment practices ineffective protection of intellectual property rights and the lack of an effective international discipline for settling disputes related to international trading rules the attached statement of principles for us participation in the new round addresses each of these issues cma  attachment chemical manufacturers association statement of principles concerning united states participation in a new round of multilateral trade negotiations mtn under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt us negotiating policy the new round of mtn must foster the development of sound trading and investment practices us participation in the mtn should include as priority objectives the elimination of trade distorting practices and the expansion of us export opportunities the reduction of us tariff rates should not be among the primary us negotiating objectives for a new mtn the international trade interests of the united states should be given consideration at least equal to foreign policy concerns in negotiating agreements during the mtn foreign policy concerns other than those of a national security nature should not effect decisions on us trade policy adequate and timely opportunities should be provided for us chemical industry input and review during the process of establishing negotiating objectives as well as during the negotiations themselves ample opportunity should also be provided for the private sector to comment and for congress to debate and amend any tentative agreements made in the negotiating process before the negotiated agreements are submitted to the congress for finalapproval the mtn authority should not restrict the president from conducting separate trade negotiations with other countries during the mtn in addition the administration should not impair the implementation and timely and aggressive resolution of actions brought under us trade remedy laws during the mtn gatt dispute settlement procedures gatt dispute settlement procedures must be improved to include binding timecertain requirements for the resolution of disagreements on issues covered by gatt rules resolution of disputes already taken to gatt should be the first step in this process ft cma  foreign market access gatt signatory countries should be required to grant u exporters fair access to their markets without unreasonable barriers or conditions in exchange for their retaining relatively free access to tariff negotiations i although the emphasis of a new round should not be on tariff cutting the reduction or even elimination of tariffs on certain chemical products may be appropriate while reductions of tariffs on certain other chemical products may impose an undue burden on us manufacturers any reductions which are proposed should therefore be welljustified in the interest of reaching a balanced and equitable trade and tariff agreement the united states should negotiate changes in chemical tariffs only on the basis of request lists rather than imposing formula cuts across the board or automatically eliminating tariffs below certain levels also any us plan to reduce or eliminate chemical tariffs should include provisions enabling affected industries to obtain exceptions for import sensitive products in addition reduction or elimination of chemical tariffs should not be offered in exchange for concessions in nonchemical sectors these conditions should be included in any legislation authorizing us participation in the mtn and specifically in legislative language providing tariff negotiating authority for a new mtn round foreign investment practices a gatt code on foreign investment should be negotiated such a code should be based on national treatment for foreign investments and should ensure the elimination or substantial reduction of tradedistorting foreign investment practices including o prohibitions or restrictions on foreign investment in certain economic sectors such as chemicals i cma  o screening of foreign investment proposals by government agencies and limitations on the amounts and percentages of equity that can be owned by foreigners o performance requirements including mandated local purchase of equipment supplies and services and the share of production which must be dedicated to exports o limitations on royalties and licensing o limitations on repatriation of earnings intellectual property rights us negotiators should seek binding cosnitments from foreign governments not to use inadequate intellectual property laws to distort international trade as part of these commitments agreements should be negotiated not only to improve the protection afforded patents trademarks and copyrights but also to improve the protection afforded in practice to proprietary or confidential information and trade secrets so that foreign nationals operating in other countries may exercise and obtain enforcement of their intellectual property rights in those countries cma  exhibit j cma position on the reauthorization op the hazardous materials transportation act problem the federal government has been losing the strong central authority to regulate the movement of hazardous materials an increasing number of state and local rules now restrict the free flow of these commodities such restrictions are manifested in many different forms including permits routing prenotification equipment specifications driver licensing and hazard identification in exchange for giving up their right to impose local fees to support state and local response capabilities to transportation emergencies in volving hazardous materials and other operation requirements state and local governments are demanding funding to improve their response to transportation incidents involving hazardous materials qbj active strengthen the hmta to give dot the ability to quickly review and rule on local and state ordinances that impede the interstate movement of goods improve the ability of communities to plan for and respond to hazardous materials transportation emergencies such improvements should not be funded with a new transportation superfund but rather should take into account private initiatives such as ncric and caer to respond to state and local needs background the hazardous materials transportation act hmta was originally passed in  and reauthorized in l and again in  in the last round of hearings on the hmta reauthorisation industry pressed for national uniformity of regulations this was strongly opposed by representatives of state and local government unless industry agreed to address their concerns about local emergency response capabilitiesas a result congress refused to take a substantive position addressing industrys concerns or those of statelocal government following the  hearings a coalition of industry and state and local representatives was formed to forge consensus modifications to the hmta that preserve the industrys interest in the free flow of commodities between states and that address the needs of statelocal jurisdictions to respond adequately to hazardous materials emergencies unfortunately this coalition adopted the position that a special fund based on an industry tax should be included in the hmta t pay for training and equipment for state local hazardous materials a rgency response teams the fund was estimated at  million cma  dollars but chat is unrealistically low if equipment is included in the fund objectives we are concerned that the new taxes would also be directed at the deep pockets rather than the whole hazardous materials transportation eoanunity we are also concerned that soae states or localities would refuse to accept aoney froa a federal fund and elect to initiate their own tax on industry currently the fund concept is supported by this uniformity coalition the national hazardous materials technical advisory coaaittee an advisory coaaittee to dot the api the aaerican trucking association  the national association of towns and town ships and the national conference of state legislatures the position taken by shipper and carrier supporters is that a saall federal fund would be better than sany state and local fees t recommendations j t support reauthorization of the hmta in this congress the re authorization should strengthen the authority of dot in preempting local and state ordinances that impede the flow of hazardous materials through fees bans prenotifieation or unreasonable routing restrictions at the same time we would support efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal government in providing training for local agencies to respond to hazardous materials emergencies the federal program should recognize the contribution of voluntary industry efforts oppose the institution of another fund to provide training and equipment for emergency responders on the basis that the training is generally available and could be readily augmented by federal programs in cooperation with expanded industry efforts if necessary zquipment needs are being net by industry through direct cooperation in the establishment of local emergency response contingency plans and mutual aid programs such as cmas chzmnzt see attachment i for specific recommendations see attachment xi through iv for additional background action required approval of recommendation cma cma   attachment i cma position on issues relative to the reauthorization of hmta there are generally twelve area baing considered by tha national hazardous matarials transportation advisory council an advisory coasittat to dot tha offica of technology assessment and tha hazardous materials coalition for amending tha hazardous matarials transportation act these twelve areas and tha recommended direction cma should take on them are as follows hazardous materials regulations must be uniform cma supports the recommendation that the regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials should be nationally uniform differing regulations at tha federal state and local levels for such transportation are counterproductive to the safe movement of hazardous materials while the existing language of the hazardous materials transportation act clearly authorizes the secretary of transportation to preempt inconsistent state and local regulations the process for obtaining such a ruling has not worked to the satisfaction of government in dustry or the public dot inconsistency rulings should not be overturned by courts unless found to be arbitrary and capricious dot should consider both the inconsistency criteria and the nonpreemption criteria in a single ruling these changes to the inconsistency process will reduce the time and expense associated with determining the lawfulness of state and local restrictions to the benefit of dot states localities industry and ultimately to the benefit of safety cma agrees with the recommendation that congress should clearly define the specific roles of federal state and local governments regarding the development of hazardous materials transportation regulations in an effort to achieve a nationally uniform regulatory scheme the federal government through dot should be solely responsible for promulgating hazardous materials transportation regulations after taking into consideration the input of affected parties including industry and other governmental agencies state and local regulations should only be promulgated in areas dot has not addressed and where states and localities cma  have a unique and legitimate need to regulate cma further believes that state and local government should have the primary responsibility for enforcing these national hazardous materials transportation regulations  data base and regional flow patterns cma agrees with the recommendation that a data base sh uld be established to determine the regional flow patterns for hazardous materials he further agree that such information should be limited to what is necessary for determining the appropriate level and placement of emergency response train ing and equipment it is important that the information re quired for the development of this data base is limited to those hazard classes and materials that have the greatest potential for causing problems this will eliminate the likelihood that government will be saturated with super fluous information and will focus the nations emergency response capabilities to those areas where they are needed most to the extent possible the party most readily able to supply the information whether shipper carrier dot or statelocal authorities should be the party required to supply it also existing sources of information and sampling techniques eg dot incident reports waybill sample should be considered before establishing new or additional information requirements finally commercially sensitive information should not be required  national emergency response awareness program hhile cma wholeheartedly agrees that the public must be aware of their role when an accident occurs involving hazardous materials we further believe that there should be a shared governmentindustry responsibility to let the public know what safeguards and mechanisms currently exist to minimise the potential for problems associated with the transportation of hazardous materials the actual involve ment of industry in this area which is extremely good should be conveyed as a part of this public awareness campaign  guidelines for hazardous materials incident planning training and equipment cma   cma it committed to the development of contingency plans for responding to eaergencies involving hazardous aaterials these plans should eaanate at the local level by bringing together the resources of eaergeney response officials federal state and local governments and industry cma and its aeabership have formally embarked on two major programs that are designed to meet this objective these programs are the community awareness snd emergency response program caer and the national chemical response and information center ncric prom an industry perspective chemical manufacturers have been very progressive in assisting emergency response officials in the development of contingency plans and in making detailed support information and equipment readily available we intend to continue of efforts in this area and we encourage other industries associated with the movement of hazardous materials to embark on similar safety initiatives registration program cma would not object if dot for good cause decided to exercise its current statutory authority to establish a registration program for shippers and carriers of hazardous materials as well as manufacturers of containers for hazardous aaterials in determining the need for a regis tration program dot should focus its emphasis on product flow identification and enforcement as explained below a registration program should not be used for the collection of funds for an emergency response fund establish a fund cma cannot endorse the establishment of a federal emergency response fund without a clearer understanding of the need for a fund the amounts involved how the fund would be administered and how the effectiveness of the fund would be measured cma does not believe that the needs of state and local emergency responders have been adequately assessed in terms of training and equipment dnder issue  data base and regional flow patterns dot may develop information per taining to the movement of hazardous materials this information on where hazardous aaterials are moving should then be compared to where public and private emergency response capabilities exist only then can an objective assessment be made of the needs of the eaergeney response cma  coaaunity s imply bak ing aonty available govtrmant wi thout an adequate aseeisaent the nation is not an a ppropriate solution a coordinated national eaergency plan for aattriali acc idants  froa the federal of the needs of to developing hazardous further over  states and localities currently have eaergency response capabilities for hazardous aaterials spills existing state and local eaergency response prograas coupled with voluntary industry assistance should be considered by dot in assessing the overall needs of the nation in teras of eaergency response assistance prenotification cna does not support the estblishaent of shipaentbyhipaent prenotification requireaents for hazardous aaterials at the state or local level state and local shipaentbyshipaent prenotification requireaents are counterproductive to the safe transportation of hazardous aaterials they can cause unnecessary delays and aassive paperwork subaissions that are of questionable value to anyone cna would not object to prior notification to a central state authority of generic cheaical flow although we believe such notification should not be necessary sore often than once every twelve aonths further auch of this inforaation would have to be supplied by transporters since they select the routes that are being used based on their overall shippereonsignee geographic distribution  local perait registration and licensing fee as discussed in itea  cna does not believe the need for an eaergency response fund has been deaonstrated as with the federal eaergency response fund cna believes that local perait registration and licensing fees should not be peraitted unless unique local circuastances justify their need in the assessaent of the need for these local fees industry expertise and resources should be accounted for money for enforeeaent of hazardous aaterials regulations is currently available froa the federal governaent to those states that have adopted the federal regulations cna supports this funding approach for enforeeaent  state and local sovernaents adopt and enforce federal hazardous materials regulations cma   cha supports the adoption and anforeaaant of tha fadaral hazardous materials regulations by stats and local govern ments we recognize that the federal government does not have the necessary resources and personnel to adequately police the hazardous materials shipping and transportation communities therefore in order to enhance the safe transportation of these products cma believes it is essential for state and local enforcement personnel to ensure industry compliance with the national regulatory scheme good samaritan law cma supports the recommendation that all states should enact good samaritan legislation to protect the liabilities of those responding to emergencies involving hazardous materials enactment of such legislation is essential to enhance industry response to emergencies involving hazardous materials  technical assistance in the industry the chemical industry is committed to providing technical assistance to federal state and local officials that are responsible for protecting the welfare of the public programs such as cmas community awareness and emergency response caer and the rational chemical response and information center ncric are prime examples of this commitment we believe these programs should limit the need for establishing duplicative federal state and local emergency response initiatives we welcome other sectors of the hazardous materials transportation community to contribute their ideas and efforts in building upon these programs and communicating their availability right to know cma agrees that it is industrys responsibility to provide product specific information to emergency response personnel so they can handle emergencies involving hazardous materials in a timely and appropriate manner cma currently provides much of this information through its chemtrec system and subsequent contact with individual shippers in addition the dot emergency response guidebook is a valuable source for initial responders regarding the distribution of general health and safety information about chemicals it is cmas policy that member companies will furnish to a central state cma  authority macarial safety data sheets for each product manufactured in the state in addition our members are committed to furnishing copies of msdss to individuals such as transporters upon request further cmas new chemical referral center will enable callers to obtain chronic health information from the manufacturer of the product in question with respect to transportation cna believes that dot should mandate that emergency response guidebooks be kept at terminals to inform employees about the acute health hazards associated with the chemicals they are handling in the unlikely event that an employee is exposed to a chemical that is being transported contact with the appropriate shipper or cma chemical referral center will produce the necessary chronic health hazard information cma also would not object to the guidebook being carried in each truck cab and rail engine exposure to hazardous materials intransit is rare however if a leak should occur acute health hazard information is essential

committee report to cma board january   a year ago when john huasey of monsanto gave the coaalttees report there wasnt a person in this rooa  or in this industry  who wasnt shocked by the tragedy that occurred in india in december of  to an industry already under public scrutiny this shock added the eleaents of plant safety and operating coapetence to the publics concerns about us to deteraine the extent of the publics feelings about cheaicals caabridge reports recently conducted a national opinion survey the results of that survey were not encouraging without going into all the details the publics view of the cheaical industry was fairly straightforward we are perceived as the nuaber one environaental risk to society and the nuaber report by m e thoapson aaoco cheaicals coapany to cma board of directors january    two safety risk with the nuclear power industry ranked as number one more than  percent of those questioned feel that a bhopaltype accident is likely to happen in the us by overwhelming majorities the public supports legislation to create rlghttoknow laws mandatory emergency planning and buffer zones around chemical plants perhaps one of the more disturbing findings was that  percent of those polled arent so sure that the benefits they get from chemicals are worth the risk and about  percent of the public wants more regulation of the chemical industry even if such regulation results in higher prices for consumer products further it will cone as no surprise to you that we rank last among basic industries in terms of public favorablllty  below even the nuclear power and alcohol industries however not everything the cambridge survey found out was negative as an example the public is of mixed emotions as to the role that perceived corporate greed plays in our environmental performance about  percent felt that were just out to make a buck regardless of the environmental consequences yet  percent disagreed with that statement cma   the beet news is that three quarters of the public feels that the chemical industry is making at least soae effort to ensure that a bhopaltype accident doesnt happen in the us while thats hardly great news it does show that the public is at least somewhat aware of our excellent safety record and the things were doing to improve it even further we also learned that while the public is concerned about spills and leaks and accidents they feel that it is the longterm health effects that are most important so as we take steps to ensure against accidents and crises we should not lose track of the larger issue  namely that the public is very concerned about chronic health effects from exposure and use of chemicals in implementing a strategy to rebuild our reputation we should realize that there is little opportunity to do something dramatic to showcase our efforts as h clark said in washington recently we havent been caught doing good there is little we can do of a positive nature that will make page one or the evening news and thats probably good with our luck wed have dan rather signing off with and this is the th straight day without a major chemical mishap instead we must rebuild our reputation the slow way  with a failsafe operating and safety performance sincere attention to the publics concerns and a credible communications effort other words do good and then tell about it in cma  oring our reputation we need a goal on a public idenee scale of t to to its unlikely that well achieve the r  level that we enjoyed in the s and s when we were egarded as being the source of alracle products reachable target would be a  or a   that gray aiddle ground of public tolerance that will perait us to operate our businesses in a reasonable banner the public always will be concerned about our industry and our products that well have to live with our goal should be to answer the publics fears about us so that their reasonable concern doesnt translate into extreme actions in responding to bhopal the industry wifely steered clear of progress that would be seen aerely as public relations gestures by creating the caer and mcric prograas cma has given the industry an activist response that involves an operating coaaitaent by line aanageaent these prograas are comprehensive and directed foursquare at the publics aajor concerns about the industry mot coincidentally they also provide an excellent communications opportunity at the local and state level that we aust use to our advantage the current state of the industrys aedla relations and cosaunications efforts is one of those good newsbad news situations the good news is that the intense aedia attention to r   our business has enabled us to establish reasonably good relationships with hundreds of media people to these people as never before we now have access the bad news of course is that it took some tragic events to bring this about when i say intense media attention i mean that literally the number of media calls fielded by cma in  reached  thats an  percent percent jump from  at amoco we received  percent more media calls about our chemicals business in  than in  im sure that each of your companies would report similar results despite this media attention and despite the negative news items of  a professional view is that our treatment by the media could have been a lot worse while each member of the communications committee can recall a few horror stories from  we agree that on balance the industry received fair treatment this occurred as a natural result of increased personal contact between the media and the members of our industry in many instances our open and candid response during these negative incidents helped establish credibility with the media and showed our concern and our reasonableness as a result we have created relationships with some media people that will be a major communications asset for us in the future cma  speaking of wita our future communications activities will benefit from the success of the cma superfund editorial contact program this program in which a number of you participated was a major communications achievement it succeeded because cma adopted a responsible and activist position on superfund and took that position on the road with great persistence and thoroughness the results  in terms of editorials favorable to cmas position  were nothing short of incredible the editorial contact program also proved once again that the industrys greatest communications assets are the people in this room and your peers in other cma member companies to those in the media you are the chemical industry so to answer the question are things getting better with the media i would have to answer a qualified yes established contacts and credibility tfe have opportunities exist for substantially improved media coverage of our industry in the future looking to that future the communications committee is convinced that cmas communications objectives will be best achieved by concentrating on solving current problems with current resources while we are concerned about the industrys longrange goals we feel that we can accomplish many of those goals through properly directed attention to todays problems cma    s a result we will concentrate on the following areas in the near future we will focus our support on the caerncric programs especially now that many of the emergency plans have been prepared and are ready to take to the public our october open meeting was a caer  communications seminar that was very well attended we will continue to recruit individual companies to actively support caer communications and we will work with cma staff and the state chemical councils in their caer efforts we have set up a pilot program for communications committee members to help improve state chemical council communications programs three states are in our first batch that will begin this year if successful this approach could be expanded to additional states in the future we will continue to support cma and the cics in their legislative advocacy efforts as weve seen a solid communications program can help the industry reach its legislative goals we will encourage increased activity by chemical company senior executives in communications activities you can expect us to continue to come to you with media contact opportunities and we will promote a rational public dialogue on the subject of risk perception working with bob roland we recently held a cma   risk perception seminar for senior communications executives of a dozen major chemical companies the result was an interesting exchange of views that should encourage a more informed public discussion of this important subject before closing id like to make two recommendations to you as senior executives of your individual companies the first recommendation relates to the communications revolution were seeing in our industry  the people doing much of the communicating are not experienced professional communicators the middle ranks in our companies are being subjected to media attention as never before particularly your plant managers as a result we must indemnify plant managers against the risk of working with the media at the local plant level especially as the caer program is implemented in each community of all the activities associated with the caer program the most difficult for your plant managers is talking to the press their fear i think is that a slip of the tongue or a misquote will have negative repercussions at the home office if were serious about caer and local communications we must create a climate where plant managers can be confident of management support when they speak out i realize that different companies have different policies in this area and ther are some risks involved but we feel that cma    the risks are greater if plant managers do not work with their local media especially where the cash program is involved a corollary to this recommendation is that the industrys conaunicatlons people have to ensure that our plant people have the training and support to handle this eore active communications role as an example the comaunlcatlons portion of the caer handbook was a joint effort of the conaunicatlons conaittee and cma staff our second reconaendation is based on the fact that the public and soae of the media nake little distinction between one cheaical company and another to the public we are all part of the saae industry for better or worse the entire industry suffers when one of us bakes page one with an eaergency of soae sort with this in bind each cheaical company nust ensure that its eaergency conaunicatlons procedures are asuptodate as its eaergency operating procedures we should reneaber that there is no such thing as a national cheaical eaergency only a local incident that develops into a national story if our local conaunicatlons are clear concise and proper when an incident starts there is a far better chance that the resulting national news stories will reflect better on the industry and theres always a chance that if we do our cma   communications job right at the local level that the story will not escalate to the state or national level in conclusion its clear that we have a lot of work to do and that were going to need all the patience we can ouster a lot of positive activity is underway by cma and the neaber companies if we just give it time to succeed given our continued coaaitaent to the operating and coaaunications programs that the industry is involved with the communications committee is optimistic that over time we will achieve our goal of regaining the publics confidence this is a goal worth the best efforts of every individual in our industry thank you cma  exhibit m remarks to cma board of directors thomas i obrien chairman patent and trademark committee january   patents have long been recognized as an effective stimulant to ingenuity and technology innovation in the united states after decades of benign neglect patent and other industrial property rights have again been recognized as a key asset in maintaining the effectiveness of american competition both at home and abroad they have been receiving increased attention in the governments dealing with our economy and the competitiveness of us industry with foreign industry during the last ten years much legislation and other actions including the establishment of a federal patent appeals court have already been implemented these actions have strengthened the us patent system but much remains to be done many of these actions generally impact on the chemical industry and some are specifically directed to it in reviewing  i would initially like to mention three significant developments in the patent field the first is the precedent set in the recent kodakpolarold decision in which the courts refused to stay an injunction in a patent case during the appeal period whether one agrees with the decision in this particular case or not this decision is a major example of the continuing shift in the judiciary to a propatent attitude the committee i might add took no action in respect to this litigation but the decision is notable in what it represents secondly the us government instituted an investigation under section  of the  trade act against south korea the government is looking into the adequacy of the laws of south korea governing the protection of industrial property rights and the effect of such laws on us trade in that country through this action and various other recent actions in the international trade area the government is demonstrating its concern with unfair practices in the industrial property field by trading partners the third is the effort initiated in various sectors toward harmonization of international patent procurement law cma  and practice this represents a concerted effort by governments and business to modernize simplify and reduce the costs of patent procurement throughout the world these three developments are ail seen as positive actions in the general trend towards more effective patent systems in todays world in the legislative area in  there were no important ifs laws enacted in the industrial property field other than on government budget matters  has been a year however in which steady progress has been made in legislative reform there are presently pending  patent bills  trademark bills and  other industrial propertyrelated bills efforts continue to change the law to restore a full patent term for chemicals whose marketing introduction has been delayed because of regulatory testing and review by the government efforts continue to obtain patent protection in the united states against imported products that have been made in a foreign country with processes patented in this country changes in the law governing patent licenses are being sought to give licensors fairer treatment when licensees challenge the validity of licensed patents the committee also developed cma positions on legislation on the utilization of federal laboratory technology and on uniform patent procedures for government inventions cka endorsed the latter legislation but has concern on the high royalty sharing provision for government employees in the technology utilization legislation amendments to the tariff act have been proposed to strengthen the rights of patent and trademark owners in section  actions for the exclusion of imported products that infringe us patents or otherwise compete unfairly with domestic industry additional comments are warranted on some individual  terns as you may be aware from prior reports the last congress enacted legislation extending the term of drug patents whose effective term has been eroded by premarketing regulatory testing and review agricultural and tosca chemicals were deleted from that legislation bills have b en introduced into the current congress and hearings have been held on similar patent term extensions for tosca and agricultural chemicals the cma committee had a principal role in initially drafting this legislation when it was introduced several years ago the committee continues to yilov and supporc this legislation albeit today in a acondary coordinating role to naca because of the more mediate concern of this bill to agricultural chemical manufacturers the committee is supporting the pending process patent legislation this is of particular significance to the united states chemical industry although not limited to che chemical industry the chemical industry would be a direct beneficiary it would give chemical producers additional protection against foreign competitors who use a process abroad that is patented in the us and who then import into the us products made by that process the failure of current us law to have such protection is considered inequitable because most other developed countries have such a provision and us producers are thus placed in an unfair competitive position in international trade although some relief is now available against importation of such products through the international trade commission that remedy has problems which this patent law change would obviate industrial property rights are fast becoming a key issue in the international trade area the government has recognized that american companies have a vital interest in protecting their proprietary positions abroad and that the government should pay more attention to this element of the american economy in foreign trade dealings the government is now examining the adequacy of intellectual property protection in the context of the general review of the gsp g neral systems of preferences program the government is also reviewing whether such inadequacies of a trading partner constitute trade barriers within the meaning of the trade and tariff act of  the committee has provided and will continue to provide input for the chemical industry to the us trade representatives office on the inadequacies of the industrial property laws of various countries as mentioned earlier the us trade representative has instituted an investigation under section  of the trade act against south korea it is understood that current negotiations with the korean government may soon result in a settlement with significant improvements in korean patent trademark and copyright laws additionally in the international area the committee continued to serve as chemical industry advisor to the government on international conventions and treaties and on cooperative governmental actions in this field efforts by  the developing countries to revise the paris convention to permit a country to order forfeiture or compulsory licensing of a patent if it is not worked within a short time after grant have been successfully thwarted the solid opposition of group b developed countries which has coalesced under the leadership of the us is the reason for this success indeed there are no further sessions of the diplomatic conference planned at this time on that issue harmonization of patent procurement law and procedures is becoming an important and expanding international subject adherence of the united states to chapter ii of the patent cooperation treaty was reviewed by the committee and committee members were urged to support passage in this congress of this noncontroversial legislation under chapter ii us patent applicants will be able to request an international preliminary examination and delay entering the national phase on foreign filings for  months from the date of the us filing the committee has provided comments supporting a proposal for an international grace period for public disclosure of an invention before filing without loss of rights to patents patent application filing requirements procedures and time deadlines are harmonization issues that the committee expects to review in  conclusion as i stated at the outset the attitude of the courts is becoming propatent and this has generally followed a similar shift in attitude within the us government especially in the department of justice and in the international trade area these changes which are strengthening industrial property protection have not occurred overnight they represent the fruits of many years of diligent effort on the part of many associated with patents including the cma patent and trademark committee the time is ripe to finish the job in  the cma patent and trademark committee will continue to advocate cma positions in support of patent reform legislation sensible us government patent policies governmental actions to improve industrial property protection for us nationals in international markets and harmonization of patent procurement law and practice throughout the world cma  i exhibit n

jurisdiction for this legislation on how to bring the differing versions to che floor for consideration on october  the house public works and transportation committee reported their superfund bill but did not file their report until over a month later this created delay since it was necessary for the principal committees energy and commerce and public works and transportation along with merchant marine and fisheries and judiciary to reach agreement on a compromise package which would be offered for floor debate this socalled miniconference consumed most of november and it was not until december  chat agreement had been reached and all were able to meet with the rules committee in october the house ways and means committee agreed upon a funding package that relied principally upon a superfund excise tax similar to the one adopted by the senate this funding provision became part of the package adopted for house floor consideration during house floor debate three controversial amendments became the central focus of debate the first an amendment by congressman edgar dpa which was adopted by a vote of  to  adds reporting of chronic hazards to the community righttoknow section this provision is similar to the senate section that was authored by senator lautenbcrg dnj the second major floor issue was an amendment offered by congressman frank dma to add a federal cause of action provision this was defeated  to  this means that both the senate and the house have now rejected a victims compensation or federal cause of action provision co superfund the third controversial amendment was on funding by a vote of  to  che house adopted an amendment by congressman downey dny as a substitute for che ways and means committee proposal mr downeys amendment relies almost entirely on che chemical and oil industries for tax revenue to fund a five year s billion superfund the downey proposal increases chemical feedstock taxes by about  with che bulk of this increase being a nearly tripled tax on inorganic substances the tax on petroleum is increased by over ten times or if the funding for che new oil spill and underground storage tank programs are included petroleum taxes would increase by nearly twenty times also included is a wet waste management tax which cma has opposed the d wney proposal does include substantial general revenues attached is a cable which summarizes the revenue provisions in present law and of the senate and house passed bills cma  the senate and house have now both passed legislation extending superfund for five years the two bills have significant differences on the programmatic side the senate bill can be likened to an outline describing how the implementation of superfund will be changed but leaving the details to the discretion of epa the house bill although similar fills in that outline and leaves little discretion to epa these differences must be resolved in conference the differences in funding are far more substantial the senate bill calls for  billion most of which would come from a broad based tax set the house bill is larger and relies almost entirely on the chemical and oil industries for its revenues during the final week before congress adjourned on december  the superfund taxing proposals got caught up in the debate on the budget reconciliation bill senator packwood ror chairman of the senate finance committee attached the senate passed superfund funding proposal to this reconciliation bill the house rejected this proposal and for several days this bill moved back and forth between the senate and the house with each party rejecting the superfund funding proposal of the ocher on several recorded voces the net result was chat the budget reconciliation bill died with adjournment primarily because of the differences over superfund when congress returns on january   the differences in the programmatic portion should not be difficult although several are important and will require conpromlse the differences in the funding arc far more substantive and arc likely to require some significant changes in position by the parties involved until congress returns and conferees are appointed it remains too early to develop a detailed strategy aimed at reaching an acceptable taxing mechanism cma continues co advocate  a freeze in the feedstock tax  opposition to the haste end

summary of which is contained in exhibit m air toxics control policy mr sorgentl and mr berryman outlined the evolution of the proposed program to address the air toxics issue mr sorgentl reported on the activities of the ad hoc executive committee group comprised of himself messrs forney mckennon and street and representatives of the environmental management committee which had been appointed to resolve cmas policy on this issue following the october board meeting mr berryman introduced the other presenters and their individual segments mr holladay reported on the status of existing federal and state lav regulating toxic air emissions he also described various proposals pending or expected to be introduced in the congress and the states in  mr symuleski presented the proposed policy and related implementation procedures on air toxics emissions and reviewed in detail what was intended by various elements of the proposal mr kelley presented an overview of the package of legislative princi ples which had been developed to address  distinct legislative issues involved in air toxics mr marchesanl described how the policy optionsprocedures document and the legislative principles were all integrated examples were presented of how the preferred acceptable and worst case scenarios in the legis lative principles are based on the policy and the various implementation procedures contemplated thereunder mr roland presented an overview of the associations tentative plans for implementing the policy including options for a public announcement in march and concepts for enlisting supporting and documenting member company participa tion he indicated a work plan was under development and that an interdisci plinary team of committee members and staff would be charged with ongoing development and execution of that plan cma   considerable discussion followed concerning the language in the policy and implementation procedures several amendments to the policy and implementation procedures were made the importance of being able to document member companies performance pursuant to the policy was stressed on motion duly made and seconded it was voted that the proposed policy on air toxics control as amended and set forth in exhibit n be approved the board agreed that it was inappropriate for it to formally vote on the implementation procedures however it was also agreed that the procedures were an important document and that the suggestions made by the board to amend them should be incorporated and that the document should be subject to review and updating by the emc as the program evolved the implementation procedures as amended by the board are set forth in exhibit  on behalf of the board chairman sella expressed appreciation for the distinguished efforts of the ad hoc committee and the entire emc superfund reauthorization association activities  mr stover presented an overview of recent developments and related association activities and strategies mr stover expressed his gratitude to the dow chemical company for the outstanding contribu tion made by mr lee nute in serving as the superfund project manager during the past year legislative status  mr denyes report is attached as exhibit p he highlighted the likely makeup of the housesenate conference committee and the potential areas of conflict and some possible scenarios for resolution the impact of grammrudmanrollings and the tax reform debate were also discussed mr denyes identified some ongoing areas of cma activity including the targeting of conferees as well as members of the senate finance committee and the house ways and means committee the various funding options being considered by the congress were discussed chairman sella reviewed the program implemented last october and november of senior executive visits with members of congress he requested chat the associations plan continue to include utilization of board members and other senior executives in visits with the conferees and the administration messrs denyes and stover indicated that this was part of the work plan and would be utilized as appropriate mr sella reiterated his belief that this was an extremely important activity which should be aggressively pursued funding policy  chairman sella reported on the executive commit tees discussions regarding the associations policy on superfund funding he indicated based largely on the input from the government relations committee and staff that the executive committee agreed that no change in the associations cma   formal policy on superfund funding was necessary and chat the association would aggressively advocate the following points in the conference committee debate freeze the feedstock tax at existing levels strongly oppose the downey amendment language support a broadbased funding component there being no further business the meeting was adjourned at  pm charles w van vlack corporate secretary certified correct cma  exhibit a report of the chemical industry trade advisor tothe board of directors of the chemical manufacturers association january   my comments are directed to trade policy   this morning  and what i believe to be our industrys concerns hopefully   they will dovetail with a spilners cma international trade committee report i wish my report this morning had better news  on trade matters   we continue to lose ground unfortunately  our tctal industry sales   to overseas markets   and produce another is   abroad as an industry   we are one of americas major international traders only agriculture   and electronic manufacture compare with our industry   in international trade accounts in washington   both the executive and legislative branches of government   have become mere interested in trade during the past year but the resulting patchwork quilt of initiatives is confused  nd   in some instances   counterproductive ie tax policy seme bills   to be sure   are wellconceived others  unfortunately   run the gamut from political posturing   to downright foolish gunslinging we cannot assume that wisdom   or common sense   will carry the day just look at the democratic tax bill   as the latest example   of how badly our industry has been treated furthermore   in the marketplace   were seeing the emergence of powerful new competitors   different competitors than we night have envisioned only a few years ago the gulf states oil producers no longer hold world users on a short leash today they have abundant cheap feedstocks   new lowcoast production capacity   and plenty of incentive   to sell a lot of valueadded petrochemicals in our markets that incentive grows daily as the price of that oil barrel drops we were all too clearly reminded of this by saudi planning minister hisham nazir at cmas october conference if you follow trade statistics   you know that the us has had an increasing merchandise trade deficit since  in   and this is rough because all the numbers havent been totted up  it looks as if tha trade deficit will be over billion   up at cma   least  from s deficit as recently as    we had a manufacturing trade surplus of billion notwithstanding this national disaster   our chemical industry still achieved a statistical trade surplus   estimated to be billion for  although we seem to be holding our own in chemical exports   an estimated billion in    chemical imports have been increasing rapidly   by about  per year since  they reached a record billion last year   and the usas share of world trade   declined for the th straight year in other words   our industry trade surplus has dropped by almost billion myron foveaux recently gave his annual public trade prognostication for  myrons numbers are based on the forecasts   that he obtains from about  of our chemical companies he forecasts our exports will be flat in    despite the weakening of the dollar   and that imports will be up about  percent  to about  million that will result in another  percent decline in our trade surplus for the year   to about  billion increasing share of our markets at home   to foreignbased producers lest we draw consolation from the fact that we have any trade surplus at all   lets dissect its meaning a trade surplus  means that the sales of our exports   exceed the sales of imported chemicals sold in the us as you know   sales alone doesnt mean much if your pockets are empty at the end of the trading day i believe our trade picture   is alot gloomier than our projected  billion surplus suggests if we had a way to calculate a trade profitability balance   the net effect of chemical exports versus imports   on our aggregate bottom line  would it still be a surplus i doubt it cn the export side of the ledger   i suspect a lot of companies are exporting near costs   to preserve or build volume consider the comment by imc president george kennedy   in the new york times last january   weve maintained   or in some cases of our profitability   thats another story weve had to cut them   in order to make up for the strong dollar even if the us can sustain a weaker dollar   our exports still face a myriad of problems   high tariffs   nontariff barriers   subsidized nationalized competitors   cheaper feedstocks   and our own unique brand of legislative impediments  including the burdensome e st of regulation cma   exports but trade means exports   and imports and that increasing import figure   should cause our industry to get cur antenna up are we simply being outgunned in our home markets by better products and productivity abroad or   are we the victim of overt and covert subsidies   the largesse of our own gsp system   our open markets   and the adverse effect of an overvalued dollar trade should be a twoway street   but in many initiatives   both traffic lanes seem to be coming our way each of our companies are impacted by foreign competition problems our exports have pretty much stagnated imports are causing price   and volume ripples   in many of the domestic markets our own government has negotiated away a piece of our industry   bromine products  t to israel without as ouch as a byyourleave the prospect of further concessions   canada  mexico   and a new round of trade talks   are not visible on our horizon some of our executives have stated   that your companies cannot tolerate further tariff concessions period  believe there is a sense within the industry   that past multilateral trade agreements have not always been mutually equitable   that our chemical industry has given a lot   without getting very much in return regardless   the administration is committed to a further opening of the us market   through both the bilateral and multilateral processes its pretty much of a fait accomple that several key events   broad free trade negotiations with canada   and a new gatt round   will begin within the next  months   and mexicos current problems can become our industrys problem very shortly concerning the future multilateral trade negotiations   i believe that its not realistic that we oppose an mtn it will support the process we should be assigning our top international people to help develop sound industry policy we need cogent arguments and we need allies in other industries   to ensure that our industry will be fairly treated   and not given up as a sacrificial lamb beliave me   this is a very important exercise   as us bromine producers learned   during the usisrael frae trade process they were lucky   to at least avoid a precipitous removal of bromine tariffs ard   instead   are experiencing an extended phasedown the cma board was presented with an international trade comitteerecommended statement of principles concerning a new gatt round al spilnar will discuss the itc position in more detail cma  these principles art   of course   general   but they contain some important concepts   the elimination of trade distorting practices   subsidies precedence over tariff reduction activities an mtn should be primarily a tariffswapping meet   trade policy should not be subordinated to our foreign producers are asked to pay the price   for foreign policy gains   the private sector should not be cut out of the negotiations   the mtn process should not restrict   the administrations bilateral treaty effort   development of a binding dispute settlement process   must be part of a new round this is important the gatt will continue to be a weak sister   unless it is given sene teeth  should be considered on the basis of foreign requests   and   under no circumstances   should they volunteered acrosstheboard   chemical tariff concessions   should not be made in exchange for concessions given to another us industry he are not in the business of dispensing charity   we also need an investment agreement   which will ensure that we can situate production   where raw materials availability or markets dictate we need to have equal access to local financing of profits can be repatriated foreign national tax policy   and investment incentives   should be granted on a national treatment basis an intellectual property policy   must be partandparcel of any new agreement h   is the strength of our industry   our hold card if we let it be acquired   without compensation  by foreign competitors   we will be giving away a crucial part of our future if you look at these statements in your briefing books  youll see that each is an important concept   not just a piece of blue sky trade legislation is the other key international area   with which we should be concerned when i talk about trade legislation   im focusing on importrelated initiatives   changing the importremedy laws   and considering the degree   torvhich natural resources subsidies should be countervailed cma    there are   of course   many exportrelated areas of law  that affect our trade competitiveness seme such as foreign corrupt practices and antiboycott   which were major causes a few years bach   are still unresolved realistically   if we get a single omnibus trade bill   it will be an achievement congress was in a dither in  and no clear trade legislation picture emerged because  is an election year   we have a pretty small window   perhaps until june for something to happen what that bill would finally look like is anybodys guess the elements of such a bill   will no doubt be drawn from several proposals   that were introduced last session and   possibly  from the administrations own plan so far   the administration has kept its own suggested wording under wraps however   some key points to look for are   general trade competitiveness   several proposals have been made   to establish a committee or council   to evaluate the effectiveness of cur trade laws ard agreements   or to establish what the general objective or our trade policy should be   or some combination of the above the object would be to elevate trades   exchange rates   proposals range from mandatory actions  to achieve exchange rate parity   to congressional statements that a conference should be held   to explore options and mechanisms   to prevent exchange rate fluctuations variations of a statement   to authorize the administration   to negotiate in a new mtn round some proposals go as far as to list detailed negotiating objectives the house republicans proposal  alone   addresses uscanada free trade  clause which would allow either congress   the administration  or a private entity   to request an investigation   whether an industry is being injured due to imports unfair trade practices need not be proven the various proposals would require industry  to commit to an adjustment plan   in return for a favorable finding   would give the president less discretion in overriding itc findings   and would shorten the processing time for petitions really an export provision it gives the president the authority to retaliate against unfair foreign trade practices or barriers various proposals   would   again   shorten the processing time   include targeting as an unfair practice   and would mandate specific s retaliation measures   against unfair processes as with section    congress wants to tighten these remedies   cma   making them more usable by business   and more predictable in their outcome   intellectual property rights   several proposals want to tighten the prosecution of violators   and ease the process of uncovering such violations this is particularly important to pharmaceuticals   and pesticide producers   export finance   house democrats   favor increased future funding for direct lending house republicans   on the other hand   want treasury and exim to have authority to match mixed credits the other major importreated issue   and this one may end up in the omnibus trade package   is the question of whether upstream subsidies   should be countervailable as first proposed by representative am gibbons in    us companies would be able to get relief   in the form for countervailing duties   when imports benefit substantially   from the use of a natural resource in the manufacturing country benefit would be assumed   when the natural resource is available to the foreign manufacturers   at a price lower than the export price   or fair market value  whichever is appropriate this upstream subsidies issue   is a real corker for the chemical industry   we have companies who are strongly on opposite sides of the issue at cma we have a very active working group   they met quite a few times   during a relatively short period in  that group was split right down the middle over this provision of the gibbons bill at nam   the same thing happened   right down the middle the international trade pendulum   has swung totally in the opposite direction since  our main concerns at the beginning of the decade   were export oriented   offensive measures now the issues are primarily import oriented   defensive measures designed to protect our domestic markets like the patriots last night   we have to get our offense working administration   that all major legislation initiatives   must be considered in light of how they affect our trade competitiveness the tax initiative   superfund   export of hazardous substances balanced against their trade effects   which translate directly into jobs as the chemical industry trade advisor   my role is to be a focal point   for the  key chemical groups i mentioned earlier  cma  t  and to assure that   as much as possible   our industry speaks as a single voice i am occasionally asked to deliver committee testimony   in support of a policy recommendation   that has the blessing of those groups i will also report to you periodically   on developments about which you should be aware   or which require high level industry action need your input   and your support last september   cmas itc held a day planning conference committee members were asked to bring a copy   of a public statement about trade   made by a senior executive of their respective cempanies the itc   that about half the companies present   had no senior executive who had spoken out on trade   no executive to champion trade policy activities in the company a sound trade policy   for out industry   requires a long term commitment from all members of this board if our industry is to remain internationally competitive   we must all become involved   in convincing the administration   that the future of manufacturing   in this country   requires the development   of an aggressive trade policy initiative each of you has a measure of clout and key members of congress lets put international trade committees efforts rules   for our industrys industrys with the administration  some of it behind cmas   to reestablish the ground international competitiveness thank you cma  f exhibit b remarks to cmas board of directors by allan j chairman spilner international trade committt january   thank you hr chairman and thank you dexter for your xcallant summary of tha trada situation and tha trada policy issuas tha j s chamical industry is facing this morning i will touch on soma of thasa issuas and will review what cmas intarnational trada committaa accomplishad in  and what it plans for  also what wa axpact to

still ralativaly high valua of tha dollar howavar soma of tha trand is certainly dua to othar factors such as rastrictad accass to foreign markats i cma s market access restrictions often take the form of high tariffs used to protect relatively inefficient local producers access is also restricted by laus requiring owners of patents in certain foreign countries to produce the product in that country or lose exclusive rights to the patent in such cases the patent owner is sometimes prohibited from importing the patented product into that country when a local producer decides to make it there and is also prohibited from collecting royalties from that producer section  of u s trade law authorizes the president to retaliate against the unfair practices of foreign governments or instrumentalities which harm u s exports but  only applies to nontar iff barriers which violate international trade agreements at the present time there are no effectively enforceable international agreements on intellectual property rights such as patents nevertheless clia is already on record in strong support for the establishment of such agreements and where appropriate has included statements to that effect in testimony over the last f w years the trend of rising imports might also be due in part to the united states being overly generous in continuing to grant duty free entry under the generalized system of preferences gsp to imports of eligible products from developing countries whose producers are now fully competitive with producers in the industrialized countries cma addressed the gsp issue when renewal legislation was proposed the cma position advocated stricter standards for graduation of beneficiary countries from dutyfree treatment of imports under gsp in cases where preferential access to the us market is no longer needed a twotiered system of benefits was included in the renewal of gsp in the trade and tariff act of  regulations implementing the twotier system will be issued later this year on completion of the administrations twoyear study to determin which countries should receive which level of benefits the international trade committee will review the regulations to make sure they are adequate in dealing with these and other issues affecting trade the committees primary concerns are that the u s ctremical industry be treated fairly and that any trade negotiations result in increased export and investment opportunities cma  for the procttt its if clia member companies acting through the trade committee and then the board must first reach consensus on the issue then cma must lobby the congress the administration and the trade negotiators as appropriate to make things happen as cma lobbying will involve not only the international trade committee and qcita but also the government relations committee depending on the issue we may even ask that some of you become involved in the lobbying effort after all as the headline of an article in the january issue of duns business month put it ceos make the best lobbuists as an example cma such efforts can be and have been effective members were largely responsible for the insertion into the renewal of the generalized system of preferences and into the caribbean basin economic recovery act cbi of provisions for the protection of the intellectual property of u s companies in countries covered by the legislation timing is also important for maximum effectiveness we may need to prom te cma positions to the administration before the administrations position has been announced afterwards is often too late to get anything changed with that as background i will review what the trade committee accomplished in  and what it plans for  bilateral and multilateral trade initiatives were the most important issues taken up by the international trade committee in  the committee developed and the board approved a cma position on bilateral freetrade negotiations between the united states and canada the cma position supports the reciprocal elimination of tariffs on chemicals and related products in us canadian trade on the condition that the canadian government eliminate preferential canadian chemical feedstock and energy policies and restrictions on foreign investment in chemicals incidentally on friday i learned that the board of directors of the canadian chemical producer association ccpa approved a position on us canadian tariff negotiations that is similar to cmas position  that tariffs on all chemicals should be on the table for negotiation not just certain chemical subsectors or groups of products such as ccpas original list of  a copy of ccpas position is on its way to us in january the board approved a cma position supporting publication and implementation of the draft white house policy on the export of hazardous substances cma  th  draft policy is based on tha principla of exchanging information on regulatory activitias with othar countrias rath tr than on diract controls such as licansing of exports or prashipmant notification to tha fortign govarnmant on aach transaction movamant of product an ad hoc

improvement in th protection afforded intellectual property rights approval for tha proposad position will be sought from tha board tomorrow cma   was also a year of much congressiona debate on trada but no significant trade legislation was anactad congressman introduced a large number of trada bills in frustration over the growing trada deficit and out of concern that the administration lacks a comprehensive policy to deal with trade problems however the number and complexity of the trad bills proposed the lack of strong central congressional leadership on international trade and the house ways and means committees preoccupation with tax reform prevented passage of broad scope trade legislation during the year possibly in response to the congressional activity on trade in september president reagan announced a new  point trade policy action plan to pursue us rights and interests in international commerce under the action plan a strike force was established to initiate or accelerate trade remedy proceedings against unfair trade practices of other countries several trade remedy proceedings were initiated by the administration by year end while  was a year of congressional debate on trade and administration preparation for negotiations  will see more action congress has stated that international trade will be the next major issue it will address once work on tax policy is out of the way the house ways and means committee is planning a weekend retreat early in the session to initiate its work on trade problems what the result will be is uncertain as dexter mentioned getting a single omnibus trade bill out of the many which have been introduced will be an achievement however congress wi not pass sectorspecific legislation restricting imports unless the trade deficit continues to grow unabated and the strike force and other elements of the presidents trade action plan are considered ineffective rather any new trade legislation will focus on strengthening the presidents authority to initiate action against unfair trade practices of foreign countries and will encourage the president to take such action new trade legislation may also include limitations on the presidents discretion in granting import relief in escape clause cases once an injury finding has been made in addition it may include expanded trade adjustment assistance for workers and assistance for communities whose industries have been hit by international competition tha committ a is studying individual provisions of bills that might hava an impact on tha

driving force behind most recent environ mental and chemical control laws and regulations the health and safety committee gives cma the ability to orchestrate a consistently coordinat ed advocacy program for public health and safety policy the commit tees oversight of health and safety policy facilitates the integration of these issues into programs and policy developments of the other committees resulting in a closer working relationship with the environ mental management communlcations engineering advisory distribution and state affairs committees and the biomedical and environmental special programs the committee replaced two standing committees  the chemical regulations advisory committee crac and the occupational safety and health committee osh two executive committee task groups  the public compensation task group and the uarep work group and reduced the number of task groups from  to  this consolidation was accomplished without disruption of any ongoing activities or significant loss of relationships with outside groups this has allowed us to address the pressing issues with fever task groups and fever people reducing the number of member company representatives involved requiring less travel and fewer meetings the restructuring of the industry and of many cma member companies has presented unique challenges in that several of the key task group members and some of the committee members have had significant job changes resulting in some people turnover and changes in leadership unlike the predecessor committees or task groups the current task groups no longer have agencyspecific responsibility but have functional responsibility based upon the expertise needed by the group to carry out its mission the functional units are risk analysis risk management risk communications compensation and external affairs and are shown schematically on page  of the report the committee has  major goals that were developed at a planning meeting shortly after the committee was formed we can pick and choose cma   and appropriate task force expertise and resources needed to achieve successful completion of each goal this creates a true matrix organization and allows us to focus resources on an issue without redundancy and needless waste of time for company or staff personnel the committee and most of its task groups have kept busy all of  because of the diversity and complexity of the issues for which the committee is responsible the reorganization necessary to consolidate the ongoing activities without loss of momentum and the constant demand for action and reaction as a result of the several chemical releases which have occurred at bhopal institute and elsewhere we initiated new programs to improve the publics perception of the chemical industry as being responsible we also have had some less visible but equally necessary programs which are more basic and behind the scenes these activities usually involve generally working with legislative or regu latory contacts on issues vital to the industry the remaining time that i have today will be spent discussing some examples of programs followed by a brief review of areas which the committee anticipates will require priority attention in the future following the bhopal catastrophe a special task group chaired by hamilton hurst and reporting to the executive committee developed the two new chemical industry programs  program and the national chemical response and information center or ncric the caer program was assigned to the health and safety committee for implementation and followup it has been well received and contin ues to generate favorable reaction from the media and regulators industry reception has also been good over  companies have signed up to participate in the caer program and have named an executive as the companys caer coordinator the caer coordinator is a critical link between the companys facilities managers and the program the caer task group has held a series of regional workshops at which the program has been described to more than  chemical indus try managers and over  sites have been selected to begin the process for implementing caer in addition community coordinating groups which usually include emergency response officials elected officials and representatives of industry and the public have been initiated caer handbooks have been distributed in the us and other communications materials including slidetape shows videotapes and brochures have received wide distribution to facilities managers emergency response groups and police and fire fighters a monthly caer newsletter is prepared and distributed by the task group caer has created a consnunlcatlons network for cma and member companies to local emergency response groups and to the epa federal emergency management agency fema other federal agencies and with other trade associations cma   caer has helped to prominently portray the industry as being concerned with public health and safety and has given us the unique opportunity to build public credibility we are continuing our efforts to capitalize upon this initiative although caer has been highly successful in showing positive actions that industry is taking we have some concerns of which you should be aware and that do require atten tion of the  companies that have signed up for the caer program  have not submitted either of the  milestone reports which are now past due this creates concern that ve may not be able to maintain the credibility of the program we need your help through contacts you may have in other companies to continue to emphasize the importance of the caer initiative to the current and future credibility of the industry turning now to the less visible programs the committee and its task groups have conducted these activities are more numerous than the upfront active visible programs such as caer and have been equally as effective in supporting cmas advocacy positions in response to public legislative demands following bhopal the occupational safety and health administration osha developed their special emphasis program designed to target chemical plants for addi tional safety and health inspections irrespective of plant safety performance these inspections were initially designed by osha to be highly technical indepth process hazards reviews rather than routine osha inspections by working with the agency representatives of the committee were able to help osha recognize its lack of expertise to carry out such a program and then assisted in redrafting the program to be one that only serves oshas purposes but is consistent with our companies process safety management reviews also in the occupational safety and health arena our committee became aware that a representative of the international textile workers union had chaired a committee which had completely rewritten the bureau of labor statistics reporting guidelines for occupational illness and injury bls  this document which contained very onerous pro visions for all of industry some of which are detailed at the top of page  in your book had already been approved by the department of labor and submitted to the office of management and budget mb for approval to implement by contacting mb we were able to get the document recalled by the department of labor and then rewritten to present more balanced guidance on reporting occupational illness and injuries this has been followed with extensive contacts with bls including taking the commissioner and member of her staff to tour plants in our industry representatives of the committee have also been very active with era in the toxic substances control act tsca area and have addressed many of the concerns that surfaced during congressional hearings regard ing assessment and management of chemicals a dialogue group under the umbrella of the conservation founda tion came to agreement on mechanisms for epa management of new chemi cals after premanufacturing notification pmn this issue is a tsca deficiency that was highlighted during congressional testimony cma   representatives of the tsca reauthorization task group provided the leadership to bring the industry public interest representatives and state members of the dialogue group to closure on the program the program now called new chemical followup has been recommended to epa for action the agency has indicated a willingness to initiate rulemaking to codify the program thus defusing this concern in future congressional activities another concern during congressional discussions of tsca was negotiated testing the natural resources defense council nrdc cma and epa worked collectively to develop a procedure for negotiating test agreements and developing test rules under section  the new procedure was developed under the principle that test rules and negotiated testing agreements should be equivalent and consent orders under tsca section  would be the primary mechanism to satisfy that principle the consent orders as the test rules would include requirements to ensure adequate and reliable data would be enforceable and would conform to other tsca regulatory requirements in addition the new procedures would include an opportunity for public participating and an expedited schedule for negotiating and rulemaking after final agreement by the  involved parties epa will issue the procedures as an interim final rule in february or march  the result of this successful effort has been to lower public pressure to amend tsca precluding what could be more onerous testing procedures and timetables it has also improved working relationships among the  parties involved in the negotiations the committee has also through the public compensation task group assisted government relations in recommending and supporting various initiatives in the superfund reauthorization process these have included recommending public health surveillance as an integral compo nent of superfund assisting in preparing lobbying packages opposing victimsf compensation proposals as these were introduced or discussed and communicating the results of the uarep study of possible health effects from hazardous waste sites the superfund bills before congress have no victims demonstration programs no federal cause of action and much better health studies provisions as a result priority issues which are anticipated to require significant attention in the future are the following o the occupational safety and health administration osha has been relatively inactive in standards development for the last  years few standards have been developed and those that have been devel oped have responded to court mandates or intense legislative pressure industry has not had to comply with the new regulations but we have missed opportunities to assist in the development of standards which address workplace needs in a costeffective way osha will not be able to continue being unresponsive to its legis lative mandate nor is it in industrys best interest to continue to miss significant opportunities to assure costeffective practi cal workplace standards through its national emphasis program osha has served notice that our industry irrespective of our excellent safety record cma   will be more carefully scrutinized for workplace safety and health we can anticipate that in addition t increased standardssetting chemical plants will be inspected more frequently by osha the health and safety committee is prepared to assist osha where it is needed and appropriate including considering the development of some forwardlooking programs to continue to improve the industrys image o in the toxic substances control act tsca area biotechnology regulation is relatively quiet now but will likely become more active in the future although it may become a high visibility issue we want to keep it separate from other tsca issues we will continue to monitor work closely with other trade associations and develop positions as appropriate reauthorization of tsca has been given a lower priority by congress for the last year largely because their calendar was so full of other healthrelated activities this will not last however we will continue to address the identified concerns and stand ready to become a player in the debate as soon as it is rejoined a national research council nrc report stated that the toxicity data that are available on chemicals in commerce are both very limited and inadequate many people are now using this report to show a supposed need for mandatory testing and a minimal test set unfortunately no readily available body of data exists to give a better understanding than is given by the nrc report the committee will be evaluating the accuracy of the report and what can be done to improve the data base and refute the report this is probably a longer term project however and not one that lends itself to relatively early resolution o legislative activities will continue especially in the area of the chemical industrys effect on the health of the public and our work force occupational illness had drawn several congressional bills recently and the proponents of such measures have not been success ful yet the committee is already actively participating in this debate and will continue in order to prevent our industrys opera tions and products from being unfairly singled out for legislative treatment public compensation activities will continue especially in the area of product liability where we are working with the cma general counsels office and the government relations staff to address senator danforths bill the superfund reauthorization battle will be rejoined soon and health effects from hazardous waste sites will continue to be one of the emotional leaders in this struggle the public compensation task group will continue to play an important role in this area the issue of health effects from emissions from operating facilities will come more to the fore the environmental manage ment committee assisted by the health and safety committee has cma   been developing a position on this congress and the regulatory agencies vlll continue however to use public health as the driving force for more legislation and regulation addressed at the chemical industry the health and safety committee will continue to develop health policy for the association and to assist other committees and departments to respond to issues in the public health arena the health and safety committee has been conceived bom and nurtured during a very trying time for the chemical industry we believe we he successfully negotiated this traumatic birthing without losing any momentum with our goals constantly in front of us and our eyes on them f one of the hallmarks of the committees activities has been to try to address issue in there entirety by going to the heart of the problem and looking at how legislators and regulators decide to take action using this assessment we have addressed the issues in depth and pro posed longterm fixes not just treated the obvious symptoms and provid ed a cosmetic cure and left the roots of the issue unattended the committee intends to continue this approach to the health and safety issues which will be affecting the chemical industry in the near and distant future i i will be glad to answer any questions you may have i s i i i cma  exhibit d report of the chemical industry council of new jersey request for

status and programs of the various state chemical organizations was presented by mr bill wood of dupont who chaired a special ad hoc work group established to conduct this cma  report the report gave an overview of the status and programs of the  cics and made some generic recommendations for cma and member company actions to improve the effectiveness of all cc programs generally although reaction to the report was favorable several of the associations officers and directors requested that more specific requests for action be made to the board with respect to individual cic programs where there are particular problems andor needs at the october annual meeting all of the state chemical organizations their leaders were asked to identify those areas where they believed cmas directors could uniquely assist their program the cicnj is the first to respond recommendations the leadership of the cicnj acting pursuant to the opportunity made available as a result of the september cma board meeting suggests that the following actions be taken by individual companies at the direction of members of the cma board it is the belief of the cicnj leadership that positive action on these recommendations will result in significantly increased effectiveness on the part of the cicnj it is also their belief that direct action by members of cmas board and other cma executive contacts are essential to accomplish these actions company participation i  that nominees from cma member companies to the cicnjs board and executive advisory committee represent the most senior individuals possible from new jersey operations i  that cma member companies support through organizational membership and active committee participation the cicnjs programs increased public

january   in  che tax policy committee was very deeply involved in key legislative issues affecting the chemical industry responding co the numerous problems raised in both tax reform and superfund reauthorization legislation the committee effectively handled a wide range of tax issues that could increase industry tax costs by more chan  billion annually since november  the tax policy committee has focused on che major tax revision issues that are of continuing concern to the chemical industry these issues were first raised in the context of che treasury departments  tax reform proposals and later in the preparation of cmas testimony on president reagans may  tax reform program before the house committee on ways and means in general president reagans  tax reform program would shift almost  billion of the federal income tax burdens now borne by individuals to the business sector the presidents program would substantially increase the tax burdens of businesses chat are capital intensive and that engage in significant international trade the specific issues raised in the presidents program are set out in detail at tab  of our committee report for this reason i will not repeat that discussion except to reiterate why federal tax issues are so vitally important to the chemical industry first let me emphasize that for many years the chemical industry has enjoyed one of the most favorable tax positions among us industrial sectors both reasonable capital cost recovery periods and the investment tax credit have been available for chemical manufacturing investments for a number of years to some extent the principal achievement of the accelerated cost recovery system acrs adopted as part of president reagans  tax program was to provide other industries with tax depreciation comparable to chat which the chemical industry enjoyed beyond its favorable depreciation position the chemical industry is unique among capital intensive industries in che extent to which it can utilize the investment tax credits generated in  the chemical industry invested more chan  billion in new plant and equipment almost  percent of chose expenditures qualified for che investment tax credit in current dollars the investment tax credit reduces the annual tax bill of the us chemical industry by over  billion moreover the chemical industry is far more dependent on international trade than many other capital intensive industries for example in  che united states exported chemicals and allied products with a value of  billion and in chat year imported  billion with a combined total of approximately  billion in cma  ic is clear that cma has a strong vital interest in tax reform legislation that reflects a uniquely chemical industry concern we are organized under a comprehensive work plan to defend the industrys interests in taxation we are working cooperatively to implement that plan on capitol hill we look forward to positive achievements in the senate and in any tax legislation that may be enacted this year in closing let me reiterate what i told you at this time last year the tax policy committee and its members have worked hard this year the members of the committee are true tax professionals who have devoted a substantial amount of time and effort to achieving the objectives of the committee again i am proud to have served as chairman while relatively unheralded cmas achievements in taxation both legislative and regulatory are unsurpassed in their contribution to the wellbeing of our industry we expect to continue this record of positive achievement in cma  exhibit f tax reform advocacy background the house of representatives narrowly passed hr  the ways and means committee tax revision legislation after president reagan personally intervened in the congressional debate like president reagans may  tax program hr  would provide a massive shift of federal income tax burdens now borne by individuals to business taxpayers within the business sector hr  would substantially increase the tax burden of businesses that are capital intensive and that engage in significant international trade it is conservatively estimated that the overall impact of hr  as passed by the house would cost the chemical industry more than  billion annually cma program development and response since november  the tax policy committee has focused on the maor tax revision issues that are of continuing concern to the chemical industry these issues were first raised in the context of th treasury departments  tax reform proposals and later in preparation of cmas testimony before the house committee on ways and means in addition the committee prepared several onepage specific legislative issue analyses which the taxation task group of the government relations comittee has used extensively in our meetings with congressional members and staff cma commissioned price waterhouse to conduct a study of effective tax  rates in the chemical industry the price waterhouse study of is companies who are primarily engaged in chemical manufacturing shows that these companies paid an effective tax rate of over  percent in  one of the highest effective tax rates paid by any industry group in that year the price waterhouse study has been distributed widely and is being used by cma in its lobbying efforts on both tax reform and superfund the response to the price waterhouse study has been very favorable in addition cma provided a grant to the institute for research in the economics of taxation iret for a study on the impact of selected tax reform proposals on capital formation in the chemical industry these provisions include the repeal of the investment tax credit reduction of depreciation benefits recapture of accelerated depreciation and increased alternative minimum tax in its brief summary the iret study concludes that major provisions in the presidents tax reform proposals and in the tax reform options under consideration by the cma  committee on hays and means would have devastating effects on the us chemical manufacturing industry particularly damaging would be the proposed changes in depreciation rules along with the proposed excess depreciation recapture and the alternative minimum taxes despite the proposed reductions in statutory tax rates these changes would raise the effective tax rates to which chemical manufacturing companies are exposed and would as a result materially slow the growth in the industrys production facilities and employment cost the industrys employees billions of dollars in lost real wages and reduce the industrys output substantially below levels that would otherwise prevail the competitive position of us chemical manufacturers in both domestic and foreign markets would be significantly eroded on january  the senate finance committee announced that it will hold hearings on tax reform beginning january  emphasizing the consequences of hr  for international trade of us manufacturers in these hearings cma is requesting the opportunity to testify the tax policy committee and the government relations committees taxation task group have developed a comprehensive legislative strategy and work plan on tax reform legislation the taxation task group has held regular meetings to implement this work plan to share intelligence on tax legislation and to coordinate cma activities with allied trade associations cma has now been joined by other major trade associations in the opposition to key tax revision proposals in hr  affecting capital formation and international activities he anticipate that there will be much greater concern in the senate over the tax impact on those policies than was shown in the house action required for

advocacy overview congress the first session of the th congress was an active one for both the house and senate on economic issues but they did not reauthorize any of the pending environmental laws congress adopted the grammrudmanhollings bill a law which requires a balanced budget by fiscal  and requires presidential sequestration orders across the board on outlays and budget authority in order to achieve intermediate deficit targets each year if congress and the president do not meet deficit targets through legislative action each year the house passed a comprehensive tax reform bill the bill reduces tax rates for individuals increases the personal exemption and the standard deduction for individuals reduces real estate tax shelters repeals the investment tax credit reduces five corporate brackets to three and reduces the top corporate rate from  to  percent reduces the deductibility of business entertainment expenses to  percent of the current level establishes a broadbased  percent minimum tax for both corporations and individuals and establishes less favorable depreciation schedules two bills in conference would reauthorize the safe drinking water act through  and authorize a total of  billion for sewage construction grants and  billion for water pollution control through fy  bills passed in differing forms by both the house and senate and now awaiting conference would reauthorize the superfund act many controversial issues remain to be resolved including the funding level funding mechanism and program issues congress passed the textile and apparel trade enforcement act and sent it to the president it was vetoed on december  hours before it would have become law without his signature the bill was designed to restrict and regulate textile imports yet maintain a level of foreign imports high enough to allow consumer choice page i cma  the  congressional session is very unpredicatable at this time because the grammrudmanhollings deficit reduction law presents congress with many new challenges add to this the usual uncertainties of an election year and  will add up to another difficult year for the congress federal regulatory agencies environmental protection agency epa the agency is moving rapidly to implement legislation under the clean air act the clean water act the toxic substances control act the safe drinking water act sdwa and the research conservation and recovery act rcra regulatory activities under the sdwa are especially vigorous and rcra implementation during the next quarter will be dynamic food and drug administration fda the recent decision by fda to classify the risk of cancer from methylene chloride exposure as de minimis at a risk of one in a million is a major step away from the ero risk concept the decision is sure to be challenged but it dramatizes a growing awareness among federal agency administrators that adhering to zero risk even for carcinogens in food is an unacceptable public policy it also adds another case to a growing set that endorses a lifetime risk of one in a million as a future standard osha special chemical industry program on november   osha established a pilot national emphasis program for programmed inspections of chemical industry establishments the program which reflects virtually all of cmas comments of august  appears to represent a sound approach during the first year of the pilot program eighty plant programs will be inspected by qualified compliance officers who will examine process safety and emergency response procedures occupational safety s health administration osha osha is also completing its inspection check sheet for evaluating industrys worker education and training programs this program will become effective in may  federal energy regulatory commission ferc the commission has proposed a natural gaa block billing rule that could cost the chemical industry  million a year if not modified us department of energy doe the secretary of energy john herrington announced that doe is developing options for natural gas legislation that will serve as the basis for a new administration bill for deregulation he indicated that an administration bill is preferable to endorsing any of the several gas bills pending and their bill should be ready for congress in january  page  cma  the doe also plana to send national energy policy plan v to congress m january the plans are required every two years as updates of federal energy policies states advocacy at any level of government depends on early warning rapid response and early involvement modern technology ie the computer has given us the opportunity to greatly enhance our early participation in the political process cma state affairs division is now implementing our new twoway computer communication system called cmalinc currently there are  member companies and two state chemical industry councils actively participating it should be noted however that many of the state cics will need additional funding for their effective participa tion in this vital communications network member companies are strongly encouraged to provide this needed support the state advocacy program including the new cmalinc computer network will be heavily involved in  in the critical environmental issues identified by the national conference of state legislators namely groundwater and the disposal of hazardous wastes of course other issues will continue to be of major concern such as state superfunds which are currently under detailed study by the cma state hazardous wastegroundwater task group state righttoknow action continues to grow and even expand in scope new jerseys toxic catastrophe prevention act signed in early january not only requires the reporting of information concerning industrys operations but also allows the state to order risk reduction measures or even order the cessation of operations toxic air will become even more important at the state level as federal epa pushes this issue along with groundwater to the states cmas state affairs program has been an active participant in cmas development of an air toxics policy a new but rapidly growing issue at the state and federal level is liability insurance and the related issue of tort reform cmas state affairs program is actively participating in a large coalition of interested trade associations and individual companies under the auspices of the american legislative exchange council nearly all states are involved in some aspect of this issue of course hazardous material transportation public compensation and chronic health issues will continue to be active issues as well in  media page  cma  the closing months of  saw concentrated media attention on the subject of air toxics the first anniversary of bhopal and related activities of environmental groups the epa hazardous chemicals listing and in depth media analysis made headlines at the same time reauthoriation of superfund probably gained more media attention than expected primarily because of its intrusion into the budget reconciliation process most of this attention was in the form of news rather than editorial coverage   as might have been anticipated following the december  bhopal accident  became a year of intense environmental inquiry initial interest was in the potential for acute incidents in the united states stories focused on questions of failure to regulate or inadequacy of existing law for the media the institute wv release answered the question can it happen here attention to acute threats accelerated in their bhopal retrospective media from chemical states such as texas louisiana west virginia illinois ohio and pennsylvania were concerned primarily about this issue  with questions about training process safety and design new jersey attention included chronic issues as well as acute raising the idea of affect on communities as opposed to workers for the most part our activities relating to superfund were proactive bhopalair toxics activities were responsive the national media appeared to understand the chemical industry rationale for a broad based tax and generally referred to that position in their coverage in addition those reporters who have covered the story over a period of time agree with the industry contention that a waste generation tax bears little relationship to hazardous waste sites courts and agency decisions federal maritime commission a victory i cma through briefs and affidavits convinced an administrative law judge to decide that two chemical parcel tankers were tramps rather than ocean conanon carriers and thus exempt from antitrust laws while this decision is likely to be appealed to the entire commission it may serve as a precedent to prevent chemical parcel tankers from obtaining antitrust exemptions for price setting and market allocation agreements those activities could cost the chemical industry  million dollars per year in increased rates on bulk chemical exports and imports federal energy regulatory commission another victoryl the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has approved a rule on natural gas page  cma  transportation that adopts many cma recommendations the rule order no  is intended to promote competition in the natural gas market by facilitating the movement of gas from the producer to the user when fully implemented by the pipelines there will be a substantial cost savings to industrial users of gas the annual savings for cma members is estimated at  to  million in addition cma and its coalition partners successfully argued against inclusion of a new block billing mechanism in the final rule cma testified that block billing would significantly raise the price of natural gas for industrial consumers a study submitted by cma indicated that annual cost to the chemical industry would be approximately  million fercs action is a major victory for cma and other industrial users however the commission is continuing its assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of block billing and further action is still possible ii issues and program status hazardous waste superfund congressional developments and response senate activity the senate passed hr  on september  the superfund reauthorization for five years the legislation will increase nearly fivefold the money available to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites by freezing the feedstock tax and imposing a broadbased excise tax on all manufacturers senator robert packwood ror and other members of the finance committee put the superfund funding package in the budget reconciliation bill which passed the senate senator jesse helms rnc offered an amendment to delete the superfund funding from the budget reconciliation legislation but he lost  to  the senate once again strongly confirmed its support for a broadbased tax and freezing feedstock to finance the superfund cleanup program house activity the house voted  on dec  to reauthorize the superfund cleanup program by significantly increasing the tax of chemical feedstocks and oil the house narrowly defeated the ways  means committees broadbased tax which was opposed by president reagan most of the unions the environmentalists and a broad coalition of manufacturers with this page  cma  support the house passed representatives thomas downeys dny and bill frenzels rmn amendment  to finance the bulk of the s billion superfund from a  billion tax on chemical feedstocks s billion from a crude oil tax  billion from a waste tax si billion from general revenues and smaller amounts from other sources the program provisions were a compromise of the energy  commerce and public works  transportation committees proposals they include cleanup schedules cleanup standards citizen suits settlement procedures and righttoknow provisions including a requirement that certain companies report annually their total releases of chemicals that can cause chronic health hazards the house defeated an amendment to create a federal cause of action thus neither the house or senate bill contains victims compensation provisions which was a key cma priority in superfund reauthorization the house and senate conference on superfund reauthorization could begin in late january after the conferees have been appointed but major concerns need to be resolved on the funding level mechanism and program issues one of the major program issues to be resolved in conference is how much discretion to give epa the house bill spells out in great detail what epa should do and when to do it where the senate bill provides more general guidance the superfund task group of cmas government relations committee will now focus its attention on the house and senate conferees a strategy will be developed and agressively implemented on the tax and program issues before congress adjourned for the year on december  they made one last effort to provide funding for the superfund program on december  the house and senate conference on budget reconciliation began to consider the superfund funding issues they agreed on a compromise of the senate funding mechanism freeze feedstocks and a broadbased tax and the house funding level of  billion over five years but when the conference report went back to the house for approval represenative dan rostenkowski dil successfully moved to strike the superfund provisions because of the broadbased tax until congress ajoumed december  without passing budget reconciliation the house continued to delete superfund and the senate kept insisting superfund be included this deadlock over the different funding approaches approved by the house and senate signals how difficult the funding issue will be to resolve in  regulatory developments and response national priority list comments the emcs superfund implementation task group submitted comments to epa on proposed amendments to the national priority list the primary cma concern was epas retaining flexibility in requiring cleanups under superfund or rcra we indicated page  cma  that mandating that all cleanups be governed by one statute may be unduly rigid and in fact slow down the cleanup process policy development analytical and program activities national contingency plan litigation the emc authorized cma to intervene in litigation challenging epas revisions to the national contingency plan cmas concerns are  epa including technology standards in addition to healthbased standards for purposes of determining what are relevant cleanup standards  epa establishing costeffectiveness criteria inconsistent with the statute and  epa incorporating other regulatory agency standards for purposes of defining the relevant cleanup standards that go beyond the statutes requirements communications nearly all of the news service divisions efforts and resources were dedicated to superfund during the october to december

and response land ban prohibitions in early january epa will propose its first set of rules to prohibit the disposal of many hazardous wastes in or on the ground land disposal will be prohibited unless the level of of the hazardous constituents in the waste is less than the health based standard epa will establish for over  hazardous constituents or the best available technology is used to treat the waste to reduce the hazards the rcra regulations task group will prepare comments on this important and lengthy new rule inorganic leaching model on november   epa issued a final rule adopting a model that predicts the leaching migration and persistence of inorganic wastes in the land epa will use the model to determine which inorganic materials should be listeddelisted as hazardous wastes the model with some variations will also be used to determine which inorganic wastes will be banned from land disposal the rcra regulations task group commented on the proposed rule and is reviewing the final rule to determine whether to challenge it in court organic leaching model on november   epa proposed a model for predicting the leaching migration and persistence or organic wastes the methodology and intended use of the organic model is similar to the inorganic model discussed above the rcra regulations task group is preparing comments for filing on january   burning of hazardous waste in boilers cma will participate in a keystone workshop on january   regarding the issue of burning hazardous waste in boilers a consensus may emerge that could form the basis of a rule epa is developing to regulate this activity the boiler work group has prepared a regulatory proposal that cma will present at the page  cma  workshop the proposal divides hazardous waste burning into three categories with greater regulation for fuel that contains the largest percentage of hazardous waste policy development analytical and program activities  hazardous waste survey the emcs rcra

task group to conduct a  hazardous waste survey of member companies the survey to be completed later in  will provide cma with the most recent data on the waste disposal practices of the member companies the raw data and trends analyses are valuable advocacy tools for legislative and regulatory matters concerning hazardous waste management rcra codification rule litigation the emc authorized cma to intervene in litigation challenging epas regulations designed to codify many of the new requirements of the hazardous and solid waste amendments of  these regulations cover the bulk liquid ban minimum technological requirements the continuing releases provision the interim small quantity generator provisions the preconstruction ban the labelling requirements for hazardous waste fuels the recordkeeping requirements for hazardous waste exports the waste minimize provisions and collection systems and groundwater monitoring provisions although these requirements were supposed to merely codify statutory language the final regulations either added provisions andor deleted certain limiting factors supreme court hazardous waste siting litigation the emc has authorized cma filing an amicus brief in the us supreme courts consideration of a local ordinance banning all permanent onsite disposal facilities within the city of fairmont w va the questions to be addressed by the court are whether rcra preempts a local ordinances prohibition of all disposal of hazardous waste pursuant to a federal permit and can a locality prohibit all hazardous waste disposal within its borders the resolution of this case will have a longterm impact on the way industry plansmanages its wastes burning in boilers position paper the emc approved a revised position paper concerning regulation of the burning of hazardous wastes in industrial boilers the revisions reflect the  hazardous and solid waste amendments the revised position paper will be used to respond to epas anticipated proposed regulation of the burning of hazardous wastes page  cma  in industrial boilers in addition the position paper will be used in a cma sponsored keystone conference on burning hazardous wastes in industrial boilers industry government and environmental representatives have been invited to participate in this consensus development conference underground injection control project epa regulatory issues the underground injection control task group developed a list of regulatory issues epa needs to resolve as part of the regulatory development process for land disposal ban decisions of hazardous wastes disposed by underground injection the resolution of many of these issues may have a direct impact on whether or not certain wastes will ultimately be allowed to be disposed by underground injection the questions address technical legal and policy issues uipc sponsored regulatory negotiations cmas underground injection control group has been invited to participate in a underground injection practices council uipc exploratory meeting to determine if the rcra land disposal ban applicable to underground injection of hazardous wastes issue is appropriate for regulatory negotiations the initial meeting is to determine if enough regulatory issues exist that are amenable to meaningful and successful negotiations a fundamental question to be resolved at the exploratory meeting is whether all concerned parties are willing to participate in a negotiation activity litigation and related activities definition of solid waste cma is challenging in the court of appeals epas january   rule defining solid waste to include materials resulting from a manufacturing process or used in a manufacturing process that are reclaimed and reused in a closedloop manner in thd same manufacturing process this rule would subject to the panoply of rcra regulation an estimated  to  tanks used by cma members in their manufacturing operations as part of the litigation cma has convinced epa to propose an amendment to its rules that would exclude this closedloop reclamation from epa jurisdiction epa proposed such an amendment on december   and cma will file comments supporting the amendment codification rulecorrective action cma has intervened in a challenge to epas july   rule codifying the  rcra amendments the challenge involves among other issues the question of to what extent must owners of waste facilities repair the environment damaged by prior releases cma is monitoring the litigation and may participate in settlement negotiations with epa aimed at clarifying the rule air i page  cma  congressional developments and response house activity the housepassed superfund legislation contains a community righttoknow amendment sponsored by rep bob edgar

only fullscale air toxics bill is hr  which rep henry waxman dca introduced since waxman held hearings on hr  last june he has been preoccupied with superfund and other issues in fact waxman actively supported and worked for the edgar amendment early in  waxman reportedly plans to resume efforts toward full scale air toxics legislation this could mean additional hearings changes in hr  or new proposals in anticipation rep john dingell dmi continues to collect information and data from epa and other sources regarding air emissions and control cma will address the edgar amendment in the

reporting requirements including air emissions cma also will address this provision sponsored by senator frank lautenberg dnj in the conference on superfund there have been no senate hearings or full scale air toxics proposals however senate hearings on acid rain began in december  and air toxics may be the next topic in the environment  public works committee regulatory developments and response chromium comments the emcs process emission regulations task group submitted comments to epa on the agencys notice of intent to list chromium and hexavalent chromium as hazardous air pollutants cmas comments focused on the technical adequacy of exposure assessments conducted by epa and the use of chromium in cooling towers and the need for more technical analyses on whether the chromium emissions result in ambient problems emissions trading policy petition cma in conjunction with other industry groups has petitioned epa to publish an emissions trading policy more in line with the original intent negotiated between epa and parties challenging an earlier epa air emissions policy the most recent draft of page  cma  an air emissions trading policy appeared to fundamentally change course and undercut the utility of an emissions trading policy the goal of the industry petition is to persuade epa to publish an emissions trading policy that facilitates industry growth and protects the environment secondary emissions comments the emcs process qnission regulations task group submitted comments to epa on a technical report on developing a program of air regulations at hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities cmas comments focused on technical aspects of estimating air emissions from hazardous waste disposal sites the comments are designed to assist in developing better and more accurate predictive models for estimating air emissions from the units comprising waste disposal facilities policy development analytical and program activities i recommended air toxics legislative principles the emc has approved recommended principles for addressing federal and state air toxics legislation the recommended principles address both routine emissions and accidental emissions the principles if adopted by the board of directors will be used in developing cmas air toxics legislative advocacy programs at the federal and state level proposed air toxics control policy the emc has assisted members of the executive committee in developing a proposed air toxics control policy as part of this activity emc members drafted initial versions of the air toxics control policy and identified various options on how such a policy could be implemented by cma member companies if approved by cmas board of directors the emc plans a significant education and technical program to assist the member companies in implementing the air toxics control policy litigation and related activities benzene litigation cma has submitted its brief in a court suit brought by the natural resources defense council inc nrdc challenging epas emission standards for benzene under section  of the clean air act the case revolves around the ample margin of safety test of section  nrdc contends that epa is required to set zerorisk zero emission standards for all carcinogens cma and the american petroleum institute who also is a party are arguing in support of epas position that the agency is authorized to take cost and feasibility into account in setting emission standards radionuclides litigation on january  cma filed its brief in a case involving emission standards for radionuclides this case which raises issues similar to those in the benzene litigation focuses on the ample margin of safety test of section  of the clean air act nrdc again argues that epa must set zerorisk zero emission standards for page  cma  r i i all carcinogens cma counters that epa has flexibility under the statute to consider cost and feasibility in setting emission standards vinyl chloride litigation cma previously intervened in a court suit brought by nrdc challenging epas emission standards for vinyl chloride this case probably will be the first to decide the meaning of the ample margin of safety test in section  of the clean air act all briefs have been filed and a decision is expected this spring communications the department prepared a summary and question and answer document on the dingell survey surface water congressional developments and response conference on clean water act amendments conference on the senate and house versions of s  may occur before conference on superfund the timing depends upon resolution of the controversy over construction grants funding which is not an issue of direct concern to cma cmas five major issues on which the clean water act task group has begun distributing technical papers and discussing improvements needed by the conferees are the following o compliance deadlines  cma supports the house version applying a   years deadline o penalties  cma supports the house version providing for administrative penalty hearing apa procedures fairer size of maximum administrative civil penalties citizen suit preclusion relative to administrative penalties fairer size of maximum judicial civil penalties and affirmative defense protection against criminal penalties o fundamentally different factors fdf variances  cma supports the house version allowing use of fdf compared to the almost totally restrictive senate version o postbest available technology bat requirements  cma prefers the senate version providing more time and state responsibility o storm water permits  cma supports the house version which better targets the types of discharges that should be permitted and provides for a better regulatory program regulatory developments and response page  cma  ocpsf effluent guidelines comments emcs effluent guidelines task group developed comprehensive comments on epas proposed revisions to the organic chemicals plastics and synthetic fibers ocpsf effluent guidelines cmas comments highlight technical problems in epas regulatory proposals and offer constructive alternatives to achieve the same environmental results cmas comments concentrate on epas failure to reflect the high levels of waste water treatment already in existence and the enormous additional costs that might be imposed with minimal environmental benefit to meet the proposed limits representatives of cma and its member companies met with epas assistant administrator for water and discussed cmas concern with the proposed revisions to the ocpsf effluent guidelines stormwater permit regulations comments emcs water permits task group submitted comments to epa on proposed revisions to the npdes stormwater regulations cma comments indicate general support for epas general permit approach but offers several modifications to remedy some industry concerns cma representatives discussed our recommedations with epa staff during the comment period generally the proposed revisions if modified in the final regulations will be a reasonable stormwater regulatory requirement priority pollutant listingdelisting comments the emcs water quality criteria and standards task group in conjunction with the phthalate esters panel has developed comments on epas report establishing a ranking list of section a priority pollutants the report offers industry an opportunity to delist certain chemicals from the section a priority list and subsequent regulation under various clean water act provisions the phthalate esters panel has been actively involved in this project because the epa draft technical publication concerning phthalate esters expressly allowed a delisting procedure epa biomonitoring studies comments emcs water quality criteria and standards task group submitted comments to epa on a recent biomonitoring study involving the kanawah river cmas comments addressed several scientific and technical deficiencies with the study and offered recommendations on how to cure several of them the biomonitoring activity is of special concern to many member companies since epa regional offices are incorporating biomonitoring requirements as part of second round npdes permits litigation and related legal activities stormwater litigation on august  epa decided to make a major change in the deadline for submitting stormwater permit applications under the clean water act the original date had been april   however cma and other industry groups mounted a major effort to convince epa that the deadline was unreasonable cma member companies participated in the effort by contacting epa and documenting the practical problems posed by page  cma  the deadline on august  epa agreed with our position changing the deadline to december   for industrial group i discharges and june   for other group ii discharges however the natural resources defense council nrdc has now filed suit challenging the deadline extension since the extension is very important to industry and rests substantially upon concerns brought to epas attention by industry cma and the other trade associations that have been involved with the stormwater issue have decided to intervene in nrdcs case in support of epa  we will jointly present the argument that epa was justified in extending the deadline in order to remedy serious practical defects in the original stormwater regulations pesticides effluent guidelines litigation on october  epa issued effluent guidelines and standards under the clean water act for the pesticides industry because of the strong connections between the pesticides and organic chemicals industries several generic regulatory issues addressed in the pesticides rules are also important in the ongoing rulemaking for the organic chemicals plastics and synthetic fibers ocpsf industry cma has therefore decided to participate in litigation on the pesticide regulations since any judicial decision on those questions in the pesticide context will surely serve as precedent for epas regulation of ocpsf plants in the litigation cma will be working closely with other affected industry groups and companies to coordinate efforts and to the extent possible present a united industry position on the important issues to be briefed groundwater includes safe drinking

vote approved a house proposal hr  introduced by rep edward r madigan ril both bills would set deadlines for the environmental protection agency to regulate drinking water contaminants require monitoring for unregulated contaminants and establish a demonstration program for planning to protect aquifers that are the sole or principal source of a communitys drinking water after the early action the house and senate conference was delayed repeatedly because staff and members were busy with superfund clean water and other issues staffers remain optimistic that differences over page is cma  standardsetting groundwater judicial review and funding provisions will be resolved the house bill would require states to develop and adopt plans to protect all present and potential underground sources of drinking water also the house bill has significantly lower authorization levels epa objects to most of the main provisions of both bills arguing they would lessen the agencys discretion and are unnecessary cma has supported the senate bill over the house version on three issues standard setting no comprehensive groundwater protection program and the senate critical aquifer demonstration program instead of the house sole source groundwater senator dave durenberger rmn has held  hearings leading toward the introduction of his groundwater protection bill early in  senators george mitchell dme and max baucus dmt introduced their groundwater protection bill on november   s  primarily to begin the discussions in the groundwater debate this bill would require states to have their own groundwater protection programs and to establish groundwater quality standards with assistance from the federal government cma is currently working on an analysis of the mitchellbaucus bill the national groundwater policy forum led by gov bruce babbitt of arizona announced its legislative recommendations these recommendations together with senator mitchells and senator durenbergers bills will likely serve as the initial focal point for the groundwater legislative debate next year cma is in the process of completing an analysis of the forums proposal regulatory developments and

contaminant levels litigation the emc authorized cma to participate in a judicial challenge of epas recently published recommended maximum contaminant levels rmcl for several page  cma  substances epa has set the rmcl at zero these limits are important healthbased standards that will serve as precedents for regulation of many chemicals used or manufactured by member companies the emcs groundwater management task group has identified several serious technical flaws in epas standard setting methodology and in the agencys interpretation and use of scientific information litigation and related legal activities safe drinking water act rmcl litigation on november  epa promulgated final recommended maximum containment levels rmcls under the safe drinking water act for eight volatile synthetic organic chemicals vocs these chemicals are benzene vinyl chloride trichlorethylene ethylene dichloride carbon tetrachloride vinylidene chloride methyl chloroform and pdichlorbenzene while the rmcls are technically only nonenforceable health goalsthey have critical importance for the chemical industry primarily because they are often used as the standards of acceptable groundwater quality in superfund cleanups rcra permitting decisions and state groundwater management programs in setting the eight voc rmclsepa followed a strategy which resulted in the rmcls for five vocs being set at zero on the basis of finding of probably carcinogenicity moreover it appears that epa misinterpreted scientific data in reaching several of its conclusions regarding carcinogenicity of these vocs because of these issues and the importance of the rmcls cma has decided to participate in litigation challenging epas decisions cma is coordinating its efforts with other industry groups that will also be involved in the case communications the department is working with the state affairs task group of the groundwater management committee to prepare an information brochure on groundwater for use at the state level regulation of chemicals tsca and related regulatory developments and response response to tsca section  generic testing issues positions on two generic testing issues were developed by the hazard assessment task group with the intent that the positions be used in cma discussions with epa or as cma positions on proposed rules or legislative issues related to tests o issuet use of tsca section  to require the testing of substances used as inert pesticide ingredients position the task group concluded that epa cannot justify page  cma  section  test rules solely on the basis of use of a chemical substance as a pesticide inert a chemical substance would be regulated under tsca only up to the point in its life cycle where it is incorporated into a pesticide formulation subsequent to its incorporation the inert ingredient becomes part of a fifra pesticide formulation and is regulated appropriately under fifra this cma position was approved by the health and safety committee at their november meeting o issue use of tsca section  to require monitoring for the presence of chemical substances position epa does not have the authority under section  to require monitoring or analytical tests because section a is limited to testing of the health and environmental effects of chemical substances and mixtures recognizing however that reliable human and environmental exposure data may be necessary for a sound assessment of risks presented by a chemical cma will as a matter of policy work with epa to to develop monitoring and analytical information when it is needed this position was approved by the health and safety conmittee at their december meeting quality assurance at the request of the hazard assessment task group cma cosponsored a conference in november with aihc in raleigh north carolina entitled managing conduct and data quality of toxicology studies the conference was a joint industrygovernment sponsored venture and established a dialogue between toxicology testing groups in government and industry quality assurance programs and glp issues were discussed proceedings will be forthcoming in  comprehensive reporting on december   cma filed comments on the second draft of the form developed for the comprehensive assessment information rule although the form was a great improvement over the first draft cma reiterated its recommendation that the agency coordinate the collection and management of data before implementing this broad reporting rule cma will meet with the agency as the proposed rule enters agency review in february new chemical followup the conservation foundations toxic substances dialogue group of which cma is a member has recommended that epa implement a new approach to following the commercial development of new chemicals the procedure recommended by the dialogue group would allow epa to more easily follow and if necessary regulate changes in manufacture or use that occur after a new chemical has been through agency review of the premanufacture notice and then manufactured for commercial purposes cma and other members of the dialogue group will meet with epa in january to discuss the proposal page  cma  epas methods for assessing occupational exposure the health and safety committees exposure assessment task group reviewed and critiqued epas methods for assessing occupational exposure to chemicals the exposure assessment task group proposed modifications to dispersion assessments particularly in particle aerodynamics to improve the accuracy of epas assessments evaluation of exposure assessment methods the exposure assessment task group has begun an evaluation of exposure assessment methods used by government and industry the project will determine the validity and appropriate uses of the assessment methods and will improve the accuracy of exposure assessments done as a part of the regulatory process the evaluation will also highlight critical data gaps and assumptions these can then be targeted as high priority research areas the evaluation of exposure methods will make it less necessary to rely on worst case assumptions in the exposure assessments that form the foundation of many regulations food and drug administration synosium the health and safety committees risk assessment task group provided scientific information to the food and drug administrations symposium on interspecies extrapolation of carcinogenicity data the symposium identified scientific advances in extrapolating laboratory experiments to human experience information provided by the risk assessment task group included qualitative extrapolation between species factors that contribute to differences in response between species approaches that have been used in the past and potentially productive areas for future research health and safety reporting on november   cma submitted comments to epa on its proposals to amend the requirements for submitting health and safety data under section d of tsca cma agreed that there are circumstances that will justify extending the period of reporting for certain chemicals but objected to epas proposal to extend most reporting from  years to  years cma also took exceptions to epas proposal to require companies to list studies that have already been submitted to other offices within epa for studies already submitted to other federal agencies we urged epa to begin implementing the interagency coordination provisions of section  of tsca to relieve companies of the burden of duplicative submissions procedural rules for negotiated testing in august  cma and the natural resources defense council nrdc jointly submitted to epa for official approval a draft procedural rule to allow epa and manufacturers to negotiate toxicity testing requirements the draft was the product of several meetings involving cma nrdc and epa staff senior epa officials are now reviewing a final version that copies the draft almost exactly the final version is expected to be promulgated in february  it will reestablish negotiations as a legitimate procedure for deciding what page  cma  testing needs to be done it also represents the occasional value of direct

amendment to add a federal cause of action to the superfund reauthorization bill the amendment offered by representative barney frank dma would have allowed claimants to sue in federal court for health or property damage allegedly caused by exposure to hazardous wastes companies sued would have been absolutely liable for any damages the house vote assures that the superfund reauthorization bill will not include a public compensation provision in considering its version of a superfund bill two months earlier the senate voted against establishing a compensation fund as part of a demonstration program the house and senate votes are a significant victory for cma which actively worked to prevent passage of a costly new compensation program product liability cma submitted comments on the second draft staff working draft  of the product liability bill circulated by senate commerce committee chairman john danforth rmo these comments commend senator danforth for seeking product liability reform and for incorporating many of the suggestions offered to the previous draft nevertheless staff draft  remains seriously flawed the principle problem is with causation a new presumption a  increase in the incidence of a disease establishes causation would impose liability even though there is only a small chance of actual responsibility in addition the proposal lacks fundamental due process a determination of causation by a newly created national toxic health effects panel would be page  cma  unreviewable and beyond the challenge of parties on either side hearings

somewhat narrower hazardous substance inventory emissionsdischarge reporting requirements which still need more improvements in the conference on december   the house of representatives passed its superfund reauthorization hr  the community rtk requirements are based on material safety data sheets emergency response provisions are basically consistent with the cma caerncric programs and we supported the essential features of those two provisions but a third element was added emissionsdischarge reporting we succeeded initially in limiting th list of extremely toxic substances for which such reporting would be required to only those substances so acutely toxic that their release in any amount would present an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health also included was language permitting a company to utilize reasonable estimates rather than expensive direct monitoring for meeting the reporting requirements eventually however the list of extremely toxic substances was broadened by a floor amendment sponsored by congressman robert edgar dpa to include substances causing adverse chronic health effects cma has not argued that there is no need for any emissionsdischarge reporting however we did contend that hastily addingsticivreporting to superfund would be premature and detract from the bills main purpose the clean up of hazardous waste sites cma

hazard labeling requirements are subject to implied preemption and  upheld the new jersey laws trade secret of protection the court said its holding in united steelworkers v auchter compels a ruling that the hazard communication standard preempts the new jersey law with respect to disclosure to employees in the manufacturing sector the question left unresolved by the steelworkers decision is to what extent the other provisions of the new jersey law are preempted by the hazard communication standard the court also said other provisions could be preempted under the doctrine of implied preemption  if it is impossible to comply with page  cma  both federal and state requirements or  congressional purpose if enforcement will thwart the questions remanded to the district court have not yet been answered although parties have held a pretrial conference a decision on the issue of environmental labeling requirements is not expected in the near future community awareness and emergency response regulatory developments and response on december   the environmental protection agency officially released its chemical emergency preparedness program interim guidance along with the guidance document epa released a list of  acutely toxic chemicals and chemical profiles this voluntary program is intended to help local communities become aware of any acutely toxic chemicals in their area and prepare to respond to any accidental release of such chemicals into the air the agency will accept written comments on the cepp for a  day period cma task groups will review the package and comment to epa while developing this program the agency invited comments and advice from cma and others epa included many of cmas suggestions the overall objectives of the program are compatible with caer and will complement the chemical industrys efforts by helping us implement our program in fact the agency guidance document specifically describes the caer program and looks to it as the industrys way of improving community contingency planning cma has distributed the guidance document list of chemicals and chemical profiles to company caer coordinators on november is  cma participated in a national teleconference with epa the federal emergency management agency and other federal agencies the purpose of the teleconference was to describe epas cepp cmas caer and other emergency response programs and to show how they can work cooperatively policy development and program activity on november   cma president roland sent a letter to executive contacts of cma member firms roland asked the executive contacts to do two things first to check with their caer coordinator to assure that they have submitted initial milestone reports to cma at that time only  of the  participating companies had reported second he asked the contacts to support their caer coordinators and plant managers by making sure they have the resources to make the program successful also he recommended that the executive contacts make caer a part of their companies operating procedures to date  companies out of  page  cma  participating in the program have reported those companies have selected over  sites to participate in caer over  of those sites have initiated community coordinating groups the caer task group is coordinating the programs implementation with allied trade associations and others to broaden direct support for caer in addition to meeting with the council of chemical associations presentations were made to the national association of chemical distributors the chlorine institute the chemical marketing research association the chamber of commerce and the american petroleum institute future meetings will include the synthetic organic chemical manufacturers association the chemical specialties manufacturers association the national paint and coatings association and the national association of towns and townships international aspects world environment center the dialogue between the international affairs group and the world environment center continues as to how best to translate the caer document into usable texts for third world country applications the iag has discussed the possibility of working with latin american chemical industry associations to provide a spanish translation of caer for latin american use outreach activity several state chemical organizations working with cma have held caer workshops florida california ohio and new jersey have put on workshops that have focused on local implementation of caer these workshops have typically included local industry and emergency response officials who discussed caer case histories the texas and michigan chemical industry councils have scheduled caer workshops for early  communications the page briefing package one year after bhopal  was distributed to a mailing list of  the package reviews industry initiatives to improve process safety transportation safety emergency preparedness and community awareness of chemical risks and hazards an update on the progress of the industry on programs announced last april  caer and ncric  was sent to all editorial board contacts in anticipation of possible editorials concerning a one year bhopal anniversary material went to nearly  writers chemical product distribution advocacy congressional developments and response rage  cma  hazardous materials transportation reauthorization of the hazardous materials transportation act is gaining momentum within congress several groups representing shipper carrier emergency response and public interests are all gearing their activities towards generating significant changes to the existing legislation three primary groups have emerged the office of technology assessments hazardous materials committee the dots hazardous materials transportation advisory committee and the hazardous materials coalition cma is represented on all three groups cma is concerned about the push to establish a federal fund for emergency response training and equipment local authorities are generally the first on the scene of transportation accidents involving hazardous products their representatives claim that industry funding is necessary to ensure that they are adequately equipped and trained to properly respond to such emergencies the chemical industry has countered with extensive voluntary resources to meet this need cma has strongly supported the recommendations calling for regulatory consistency among federal state and local authorities over the transportation of hazardous materials this national regulatory consistency coupled with increased enforcement will contribute greatly towards enhancing hazardous material transportation safety it will also prove economical to industry in that compliance with only a single set of requirements would be required the first reauthorization bill hr  sponsored by representative gonzales has been referred jointly to the house committees on public works and transportation energy and commerce and ways and means it represents the worst case scenario the bill would establish a federal emergency response fund financed by industry and advanced notification of shipment registration and routing while referencing uniformity of regulations the bill does not explicitly call for uniform federal state and local transportation regulations cma is determining whether this bill will receive favorable consideration in congress and will act accordingly water resources development act cma submitted detailed comments to congress on the provisions of the water resources development act s regarding the imposition of an ad valorem tax on imports and exports specifically cma called for congress to impose a cap on the tax for all exports and shipments between us ports further cma urged congress to avoid double taxation for cargo unloaded and reloaded onto a vessel at the same harbor conrail acquisition cma formally notified congress that it supports the transfer of conrail to the public sector cma expressed the position that between the existing sale options morgan stanley and norfolk southern the public offering advanced by the morgan stanley group comes page  cma  closest to satisfying the chemical industrys concerns provided conrail operates consistent with the language and spirit of the new ex parte  rules of the icc that promote railtorail competition cma explicitly opposed the transfer of conrail to a major eastern railroad such action would reduce railtorail competition to an unacceptable level shipping act of  cma is continuing to seek an amendment to the shipping act of  that would exclude all chemical parcel tankers from the antitrust exemption to set rates and designate markets this would eliminate casebycase litigation on carrier action as was the case with the recent decision in andinoflota see chemical parcel tankers in section j cargo liability bills cma is developing a position to support legislation that would modify ocean cargo liability laws cma favors clarifying liability limits so that they apply to packaged units within a container not to the foot container cma also favors legislation based on the hamburg rules since they encourage ship owners to take proper care of cargo regulatory developments and response hm  a new work group has been formed to coordinate efforts in complying with this final dot rule pertaining to the transportation of chemicals that pose poison inhalation hazards specific concerns the work group will address include types of packings that can be used to transport these materials information required by dot to obtain approval for these packagings short acute toxicity data and the determination of which materials need additional toxicity testing the work group will also explore the feasibility of sharing the cost of this testing rail to rail competition the interstate commerce commission has published its new rules pertaining to competitive access of railroads to shipping facilities these new rules reflect the major points agreed to and submitted by cma and the rail industry in the first test of the commissions new rules the midtec case has been reopened it will address the use of terminal facilities and reciprocal switching arrangements by a competing railroad to ensure the chemical industrys concerns are made a part of the record in this proceeding cma has petitioned the commission for leave to intervene conrail acquisition norfolk southern presented the federal government with a revised divestiture plan for the conrail system following careful analysis of this new plan cma reaffirmed its support for the public offering proposal presented by the morgan stanley investment group cmas support for the public offering as being the page  cma  only existing proposal that would maintain rail competition in the northeast region of the country was conveyed to dot secretary dole and congress on december   amendments to cargo tank specifications in response to the department of transportations proposed new specifications for cargo tanks cma has formed a work group to submit an impact statement the proposed requirements call for significant changes in the manufacture operation maintenance repair and requalification of all specification cargo tanks used to transport bulk shipments of chemicals and other hazardous materials by highway brazil cargo reservation the united states has agreed with brazil to renew for one year their bilateral agreement that condones brazilian laws requiring nearly  percent of us exports and imports to be transported on highpriced brazilian or us flag vessels some minor modifications favoring shippers were made to the bilateral agreement most significantly the us told the brazilians that the anticompetitive nature of the brazilian cargo reservation laws must be significantly liberalized or the agreement will not be renewed again next year cma staff attended the negotiations as a shipper observer cma will continue to seek liberalization of the cargo reservation system over the next year emergency response training and equipment in an effort to develop detailed information showing the amount of training and equipment the chemical industry is making available to emergency responders the distribution committee is developing a member company questionnaire this information will prove particularly useful in the reauthorization hearings for the hazardous materials transportation act tank truck corrosion discussions are continuing with tank truck operators over the development of an educational program designed to reduce premature deterioration of tank trucks due to corrosion rates and compensation tank car compensation the commission asked the joint negotiating committee to address three matters with respect to the prescription of a national tank car mileage allowance system these matters were the market sensibility of the proposed system quantification that the new formula will reduce the gap in allowances between older and newer cars and a comparison of the allowances paid under the proposed formula the  formula and the interim formula these comments were submitted on november   objection to these comments were expressed by wfix and cf industries cma joined the other car providers and filed a response to the objections cma is considering supporting the formation of a negotiating group to represent all the interested car providers page  cma  litigation and related legal activities chemical parcel tankers cma recently won a case before an administrative law judge of the federal maritime commission the judge decided that two carriers in the uscolumbian trade should not be given antitrust immunity to establish a joint chemical parcel tanker operation assuming the case is not reversed on appeal it will serve as a strong precedent that chemical parcel tankers may not collectively set rates or allocate markets cma which filed extensive briefs before the administrative law judge will file a brief in the appeal in order to protect the victory cma is also seeking an amendment to the shipping act of  which would prohibit rate setting and market allocation by chemical parcel tankers national chemical response and information center ncric all elements of the national chemical response and information center were on line by the end of december although much work remains to be done to insure maximum participation by the membership and use by the public the center was completed on schedule chemtrec chemtrec closed out  with a  increase in activity over  levels a total of  calls were handled of which  were emergency related nonemergency calls totaled  emergency related calls received averaged  per month nonemergency calls received are in excess of  per month medical emergencies are showing a slow but steady increase since cma officially announced that chemtrec would offer assistance to physicians seeking treatment information referrals to the chemical referral center crc are off to a slow start since crc was activated  december but this is expected to increase significantly as we enter our busy period in early spring chemnet the chemnet program began operation on november   at that time we had a membership of  since that time we have added another  members our current totals are  members of which  are participants and  are subscribers the participants in the chemnet program have designated  emergency response teams to be a part of the system the program now includes three contractors that are available to the membership the contractors have  page  cma  teams in combination the system has iso teams that are located in  states this represents a very significant resource to respond to serious transportation incidents during the months of november and december we used the chemnet system once in that case a contractor oh materials responded to an event because the shipper could not reach the scene in a reasonable amount of time we expect use of the program to grow as the membership has a better understanding of the resources it provides to expedite that understanding we have scheduled a workshop on march   in washington dc to provide details on the operation to the membership chemical referral center on december   thechemical referral center crc began receiving nonemergency health and safety chemical information inquiries from the public on its  tollfree number these calls are referred to the designated contact at the company that manufactures the product in question to date  chemical companies  are cma members have provided the crc with the company contact and product information which are required for participation in this service the centers chemical index currently contains profiles on over  products this number will rapidly increase as participating companies send the crc the requested information emergency response training first responder training program the videotape training program for first responders first on the scene is completed and being distributed the videotape is  minutes long and includes a brochure and discussion guide the following five key points are stressed in the program approach the scene cautiously identify the hazards secure the scene obtain help in handling the incident and assure safe site entry the objective of the program is to reduce injuries and environmental damages and to insure that first responders know where to get help in handling the problem there are no restrictions on reproducing the videotape copies of the tape or sells them at a cost cma loans a copy of the training program has been donated to each of the ten fema regions and the national fire academy copies are also being distributed to the state fire and police instructors lending library the lending library of audiovisual training aids for emergency response personnel has become an extremely successful page  cma  program requests to borrow the programs have been received from emergency response personnel and state agencies from all over the united states  copies of the brochure listing the programs have been distributed additional copies of some programs purchased were to meet all requests three new programs have been added to the library a new brochure being printed should be available in a few weeks recommended terms for personal protective equipment this technical bulletin is now available for distribution the booklet was developed to encourage the use of consistent terminology by those who prepare guidelines for emergency responders and to define these terms for emergency response personnel one of the motivating reasons for preparing the document was the ambiguous use of commonly used terms such as full protective clothing and special protective clothing full protective clothing could mean firefighters bunker gearturnout gear or encapsulating chemical suits depending on who prepared the guidance material special protective clothing could be encapsulating chemical suits or a splash suit copies of the bulletin have been sent to cma members urging them to use these terms when preparing material safety data sheets or guidance information for emergency response personnel chemtrec workshops a chemtrec emergency response team workshop will be held in mobile alabama on february   this will be the th workshop to be sponsored by chemtrec since the first one was presented in  nearly  people from the chemical carrier and emergency response communities have received training for onscene handling of chemical emergencies through these workshops communications the regional communications division is producing a leaflet for the chemical referral center and an overall booklet for ncric regional communications has approved a matching grant to enable the ohio chemical council to produce a film on first responder training that will be specific to ohio media training was provided for member company representatives who will participate in upcoming media tours on the national chemical response and information center energy and petrochemical feedstocks regulatory developments and response page  cma  ferc order no  on interstate natural gas transportation on october   the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued a rule on interstate natural gas transportation that adopted many cma recommendations the rule authorizes selfimplementing nondiscriminatory interstate transportation services both firm and interruptible services must be offered by participating interstate pipelines also reservation fees for firm services are permitted the ferc subsequently modified the rule so that pipelines must permit distribution company customers to reduce their existing sales demand by up to  per year over five years the modified rule ferc order a also permitted certain transportation programs to continue until february  thus far most pipelines have been unwilling to transport gas under the new rules the justice department is investigating complaints that pipelines have colluded in refusing to carry gas under those terms ferc proposed rules on natural gas pricing cma and other industrial consumers urged the ferc not to implement a proposed block billing mechanism for interstate pipeline sales on december   cma testified before the ferc and presented results of an economic impact study on the proposed block billing rule cma said the cost of the rule to american industry would be  billion per year and the annual cost to the chemical industry alone would be approximately  million both the chemical industry and industry in general rely substantially on gas purchased directly from producers for example the chemical industry purchases  of its natural gas from sources other than conventional pipeline system supply the study done for cma by foster associates predicts the proposed pricing rule would raise the price of gas being purchased directly from producers also industrial users buying interstate gas could be allocated higher gas costs the ferc proposal also restricts pipeline sales of lowcost gas to existing customers this will increase pressure on both local distribution companies ldcs and endusers to purchase gas directly from producers leading to a shift away from conventional pipeline system supply the proposed rule nullifies the potential advantages of increased competition through the expedited certificate process it reduces pipelinetopipeline competition and encourages bypass of traditional pipeline system supply sources the study also indicates the ferc proposal would increase spot sales direct purchases and traditional pipeline purchases it would add pressure on ldcs and endusers to buy directly from producers since pipeline competition will be restricted to higherpriced gas this will increase the demand for spot or directpurchase gas page  cma  in addition cma noted that since directpurchase gas is in competition with systemsupply gas the marginal cost of systemsupply gas will be higher the ceiling on directpurchase prices will be raised by as much as  cents per million btu proposed rules on old gas pricing the ferc block billing proposal fails to deal with the basic problem of continuing price controls that prevent maximum efficient development and use of the lowest cost old gas resource base and cma continues to advocate legislation to deregulate wellhead ceiling prices and to remove market restraints it appears that some cma goals may be achieved through regulatory reform proposals offered recently by the department of energy with the support of the justice department on november  doe proposed a rule for final action by the ferc that makes all old gas eligible for a higher just and reasonable price and that would establish incentive prices for old gas on december  the ferc issues a schedule for the notice of proposed rulemaking docket rm  cma is preparing written comments that are due february  a public conference will be announced at a later date the ferc is requesting comments on legal authority to adopt the proposal the interrelationship with the block billing proposal rule and the economic and market impacts of raising oldgas prices taxation congressional

 provide for business capital formation and assure a tax rate structure no higher than the administrations original proposal each would significantly increase the bills revenue cost and would require substantial additional offsetting revenue provisions senator bob packwood ror has indicated that the senate finance committee will begin its review of hr  in early february moreover senator packwood has expressed concern over the ability to find new revenue sources tooffset proposed administration changes in the housepassed bill thus the prospects are doubtful that the finance committee will

omnibus trade bill the last congress passed the trade and tariff act of  in october  although this act was the first omnibus trade bill to be passed in five years it addressed mostly noncontroversial issues of international trade since the passage of the law the already large us foreign trade deficit has swelled to record levels and probably reached  billion in  the current congress is making a concerted effort to address the nations growing foreign trade problem and action on a new piece of omnibus trade legislation can be expected early in the session senator danforth rmo introduced the trade enhancement act s the bill contains multiple titles which among other topics deals with foreign targeting changes to trade remedy laws the protection of intellectual property rights and

senate judiciary committee subcommittee on patents copyrights and  trademarks expressing support for s the major legislative vehicle on process patents the subcommittee had held a hearing on this legislation on october   s would give the owner of a process patented in the united states the right to bring a suit for patent infringement against a party who imports a product that is manufactured abroad by using the process many countries that are major trading partners of the united states already have such laws cmas comments however also urge the subcommittee to address ancillary issues

unable to obtain information about the process used to manufacture a product earlier in  cma had joined in a coalition with  companies and  associations in supporting legislation on this subject generally this coalition is led by intellectual property owners inc ipo the uniform patent procedures act of  on november   cma endorsed s the uniform patent procedures act of  this legislation introduced by senator dole rkan on january   focuses on government patent policy it allows all government contractors to elect to retain title to federally funded inventions it expands existing law which applies to contractors from small businesses and nonprofit organizations to include large business contractors as well cma believes that s is important to eliminate barriers to industrys development and application of new technology and to encourage a climate under which such development and application will be fostered moreover prompt passage of s would create an atmosphere in which

hazardous waste management and regulation the national conference of state legislatures has identified environmental issues as one of the top three issues facing the states in  the other two are education and fiscal concerns the major environmental issues are groundwater acid rain and the disposal of hazardous waste f the siting of hazardous waste facilities always a major concern has become more complicated by the growing liability insurance problem most sites cannot be licensed without insurance which is virtually unavailable page  cma  some of the action around the states includes

compromise on a package of legislation which has been endorsed by the michigan chemical council the package consists of three bills hb  addresses worker righttoknow and adopts the federal osha hazard communications standard with expanded coverage hb  requires emergency response planning through information sharing with fire chiefs hb  sets community righttoknow provisions allowing the general public access to msdss and workplace lists of hazardous substances the legislature adjourned the  session without taking final action on these bills which will carry over to  consideration is expected early in the year in hew jersey the legislature gave final approval to a  the toxic catastrophe prevention act this bill requires manufacturers and users of a limited list of chemicals to register with the state and perform risk assessments of their chemical processes the state has the authority to order risk reduction measures for covered facilities and could order operations to cease until risks are reduced to an acceptable the bill is expected to be signed into law by the governor in the near future litigation  on december   the us district court in pennsylvania ruled on the relationship between the states righttoknow law and the federal osha hazard communications standard the ruling followed the precedent set in new jersey and held that the pennsylvania law is preempted by the standard as it applies to the regulation of employee health and safety in the manufacturing sector the ruling also held that parts of the law applicable to nonmanufacturers are still operative thus creating a dual system in the state the chemical industry may seek clarification on some aspects of the ruling the ohio manufactures association has filed suit in federal court to overturn the city of akrons local righttoknow ordinance on the grounds of federal preemption arguments and filings in that case are expected to continue through january  legislative sessions  the state affairs

papers and other support materials for use by member companies and state cics who may face these issues during the year groundwater as mentioned earlier the national conference of state legislatures ncsl identified groundwater contamination as one of the three top environmental issues of  cmas state hazardous wastegroundwater task groupreports that groundwater will be an issue in virtually every state ncsl and the council of state governments are developing position papers and model legislation and cma state affairs is assisting these key organizations part of this effort will be shared with a new cma work group which combines state affairs representatives with their counterparts from the technical committees all of this activity is primarily a result epa delegating most of the groundwater program to the states combined with the likelihood of the us congress not developing related legislation until  so most of the groundwater action for at least the next couple of years will be at the state level hazardous materials transportation a bill has been recommended to the colorado legislature that would require most trucks carrying hazardous materials to get permits and follow designated routes money from permit sales and fines imposed on violators would be used to create a hazardous materials safety fund for training emergency response crews the state department of public safety would determine the routes that hazardous materials trucks could take and would issue other rules while the majority of the states have passed good samaritan laws some states will be considering the issue in  the new jersey proposal died near the end of  but the new jersey chemical industry council has succeeded in having an identical bill introduced this year additional support is needed to assure passage the ohio house passed a good sam bill on the last day of  and the senate will consider the issue early in  toxic air state regulation  the connecticut department of health has challenged a major new air toxics control program that was recently page  cma  announced by the states department of environmental control the program would set ambient limits based on tlvs plus a safety factor for  chemicals the department of health is pushing for changes in the program to take into account actual health effects of the chemicals until the agencies are able to reach an agreement the air toxics program approval process has been put on hold other states which are considering air toxics control regulations include maryland kentucky and north carolina policy development  the state affairs committee is actively participating in cmas effort to develop a new association program for reducing toxic chemical emissions once the program has been approved the committee will assist other cma departments in disseminating the program to state interest groups chronic health legislation establishing a new system for identifying and protecting workers who are deemed to be at high risk of contracting occupational disease is being considered in california ab  is strongly opposed by the chemical industry because of its burdensome requirements and high costs the industry feels that existing programs in the state already accomplish the goals of this bill and new legislation is unnecessary the california cic along with cma member companies is attempting to amend or defeat this legislation  insuranceliability almost all of the state legislative bodies are working on some aspect of this issue the most pressing concern is the affordability and availability of insurance coverage hearings have been scheduled in many states the more basic concerns of tort reform are also being reviewed these concerns will take longer to resolve they are being worked on by the national council of state legislatures and the american legislative exchange council among others specific chemical research and advocacy research and advocacy highlights alkanolamines the national

revisions along lines suggested by the panel th panel also filed comments on a risk assessment prepared by the epa office of toxic substances ots to support conclusions about occupational exposure to butadiene panel representatives subsequently met with john moore assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances to discuss the risk assessment moore agreed with many of the panels concerns the panels comments will be provided to osha to assist in preparing a risk assessment for occupational exposure tb butadiene the ots risk assessment is the basis for epa s tsca section a referral to osha panel representatives met with the osha staff and jaca corporation oshas contractor to discuss the evaluation of butadiene in response to epas referral the panel will track this activity at osha the panel also contracted with an expert consultant to review the mathematical calculations included in the ots risk assessment on butadiene the consultants report identified several flaws in epas approach and recomnended alternative procedures the report has been submitted to epa panel representatives participated in a cma workshop on risk assessment and made presentations on the epa risk assessment on butadiene the panel sponsored an audit of the mouse study on butadiene conducted by the national toxicology program the panels audit documented the quality control problems experienced during the ntp study and reinforced the panels position that the study is unsuitable for use in quantitative risk modeling panel representatives also met with ntp and cut to review ongoing testing programs for butadiene in october  epa published in the federal register an intent to list butadiene as a hazardous air pollutant under section  of the clean air act panel representatives met with the staff of epas office of air quality planning and standards to review epas evaluation of butadiene for possible regulation the panel is assisting epa in trying to realistically determine the emissions of butadiene the panel activities with epa and osha are expected to continue at a high level in  page  cma  cumene epa announced proposed testing requirements for cumene under section  of tsca in a federal register notice on november   manufacturers and processors of the chemical will be required to conduct tests for health and environmental effects health effects testing will include pharmacokinetics developmental toxicity subchronic toxicity neurotoxicity oncogenicity and reproductive toxicity if triggered to test for environmental effect the agency is proposing acute and chronic aquatic toxicity tests on saltwater fish and invertebrates and biodegradation and volatilization from water the cumene panel is preparing comments on the proposal of particular interest are the findings upon which epa bases the proposed rule a potentially unreasonable risk of mutagenic and oncogenic effects and a potential for substantial human exposure from manufacturing processing use and disposal the panel wil sponsor further mutagenicity testing to determine if there is sufficient evidence for the first finding and also is closely examining emissions data to see if there is justification for the second comments are due to epa by february   butylated hydroxytoluene the department of public health state of massachusetts has tentatively decided to delist bht as a carcinogen from its substance list this occurred mainly through the efforts of dr don mcgraw of koppers company the bht panel chairman in addition irwin prager of uniroyal testified at the departments public hearing bn behalf of the panel the department is expected to publish the revised substance list reflecting this change in january  cresols the panel is expecting the final tsca section  test rule this march in preparation for the rule the panel is receiving bids to perform the toxicology testing a final contractor will be selected and testing will begin once the final rule is issued the panel is also tracking the epa land disposal prohibition regulation cresols are on the initial list for possible land disposal banning dibenzofuransdibenzodioxins the panel is preparing comments in response to epas tsca section  and  proposed rules the proposal requires the conduct of dioxin and dibenzofgran analyses of various chemical substances the panel filed comments in response to epa s rcra proposal to change the listing from acute hazardous to toxi for incineration residues of several dioxin wastes the comments argued that epa should raise the concentration limit for wastes covered by the rule from  ppm to  ppm ethylene dibromide the panel is waiting for a longoverdue osha page  cma  final rule the panel will review the rule once it is published ethylene dichloride the epa announced last october an intent to list edc as a hazardous air pollutant under section  of the clean air act the panel provided comments on the announcement and is further evaluating several of the references given in the announcement the panel will further review the health effects and risk assessment on edc provided in the announcement ethylene oxide the ethylene oxide industry council provided comments to epa on its recent intent to list eo as a potential hazardous air pollutant the eoic environmental task group is evaluating the eo air emissions developed by epa the group is providing epa with information to realistically estimate eo releases the task group has also reviewed the epa human exposure model which is used in the agencys hazardous air pollutant program epa is presently surveying the industry to determine episodic releases or excursions from the annual average ethylhexanoic acid the ethylhexaiioic acid panel met with epa to discuss the proposed test rule for eha under section  of tsca  fed reg  epa has speculated that dermal exposure to eha might occur during processing although manufacturers and major processors have indicated to the agency that most operations occur under conditions where exposure is unlikely to bolster its noexposure argument the panel contracted with temple barker and sloane inc to conduct a survey of handling practices among processors of eha the survey responses indicated that dermal contact with eha during processing is virtually nonexistent ninety percent of the responders instruct their employees to wear gloves when they may have contact with eha and five percent distribute eha without repackaging given these results the panel feels that epa cannot justify a finding that exposure to eha in the workplace may present an unreasonable risk of injury the panel will continue to work with epa to document the position that a notest decision should be made for eha epa is expected to publish its conclusion in the summer of  fluorocarbons in october  the fluorocarbon panel released its report on the production use and emissions of chlorofluorocarbons  and  through  production of cfc increased from  million pounds in  to  million pounds in

was the consensus of the board that the final legislative principles being drafted by the group should not be drawn so as to create the impression that cma was advocating removing all responsibility for worker notification from the employer employers should main tain at a minimum the right to provide the notification even if the government ultimately would be involved as well there was also discussion regarding the delicate nature of cmas participation in the broadbased business coalition on this issue and the necessity for cma to maintain maximum flexibility for itself as the legislative debate evolved on motion duly made and seconded it was voted that the four criteria for developing the associations position on worker notification legislation as set forth above be endorsed and that the health and safety committee and government relations committee further pursue the development of specific legislative alternatives that the officers be authorized to provide

presidentsecretary ertified correct chairman of the board cma  exhibit a report of distribution committee executive summary two primary issues hava surfaced during  relative to the distribution of chemicals that demand a great deal of attention by the distribution committee these are chemical transportation risk management and nontariff trade barriers affecting the international distribution of chemicals it has become readily apparent that the chemical manufacturing eoonunity must take a more proactive role in identifying and compensating for the many variables that influence the safe transportation of chemicals state and local officials environmentalists and congressional oversight committees are among the many groups that have expressed concern over the potential risks associated with chemical transportation the distribution committee has joined forces with representatives from the railroad and trucking industries to assess the risks of moving different types of chemicals during tha upcoming year risk management models will be developed that individual chemical companies can use to work with their carriers in identifying the safest possible means of transporting their products the past year has also brought on a great deal of activity in the international regulatory arena which has had a significant impact on the distribution of chemicals the distribution committee has been instrumental in tha development of marine pollution requirements that guard against the dumping of chemical wastes at sea fortunately because of the distribution committees efforts the international requirements did not go so far as to curtail international chemical transportation or make it so expensive for us shippers that they would be put at a competitive disadvantage with foreign chemical companies cma also played a major role in getting u s government officials to intervene in the efforts of foreign governments to reserve cargo to their nations flag vessels thus reducing competition and creating a serious impediment to the safe transportation of chemicals the national chemical response and information center ncric has gone beyond the industrys expectations in fulfilling the needs of emergency responders and the public for chemical related information chemtrec which celebrated its fifteenth anniversary has seen a significant growth in activities over  calls rose from  inquiries in  to  in  a  increase chemtrec also introduced the hazard information transmission system which enables emergency responders to access hard copy chemical information via a computer link the chemnet program the industrys first all encompassing mutual aid network has continued to grow in size and importance over the past year it was recognized by secretary of transportation elizabeth dole during the  spills conference as a major industry initiative to assist emergency responders in effectively handling chemical transportation accidents the ncric landing library has also been tremendously successful over  emergency responders have had the opportunity to view the  videos the chemical industry has received countless praise for this major effort to train emergency responders on the proper techniques for handling chemical emergencies the chemical referral center responded to over  inquiries from the public for nonemergency health and safety information about chemicals an index of approximately  products has been developed to assist the chemical referral center in quickly identifying the appropriate companies to refer callers to this service is expected to continue to increase in importance over the coming year as states and local communities implement the righttoknow provisions of the superfund amendments and reauthorization act while a great deal of the distribution committees energies were directed at improving the safe transportation of chemicals during  the committee continued to promote competition and costeffective measures for the distribution of chemicals the committee was successful in getting the interstate commerce commission to overrule the efforts of a major railfoad to flag out of its common carrier responsibilities to move certain chemicals the committee also played a key role in helping to shape practical rules for railroad cost recovery practices cma also intervened in a case before the icc in an effort to establish a favorable precedent for competitive access remedies for shippers captive to a single railroad the reauthorization of the hazardous materials transportation act did not occur during  but it is expected to receive considerable attention in  the distribution committee took advantage of this time to promote the cma position adopted at last januarys board meeting cma will continue to take a lead role in the development of reasonable legislation governing the transportation of chemicals cma  cma  exhibit b chemnet membership problem the chemnet program currently has  members to insure an

of key issues and present recommendations to improve overall effectiveness of the chemical industry in texas background o texas chemical council tcc has a membership of  companies and has effectively represented chemical industry interests in texas for more than  years texas is important to the chemical industry and the chemical industry is important to texas o o texas leads the chemical industry in value of chemical shipments our industry in texas is the largest in value added and results in the employment of  texans tcc is nical member though effective because of the highly competent management tech communications and government relations talent provided by companies working closely with a respected exceptionally able small staff committees are active in safety health caer environmental conservation air water and solid waste taxes energy and public affairs high credibility has allowed tcc to play a prominent role in influencing legislation and regulations in areas such as righttoknow hazardous waste management permits and air toxics we are unique in our successful development of a broad based grass roots support organization consisting of suppliers and service firms along with manufacturers that are tcc members acit the association of chemical industry of texas now four years old with almost  member companies was formed with the specific objectives of defending the chemical industry and helping it prosper during the superfund debate acit members effectively communicated chemical industry positions with the texas delegation demonstra ting its potential for influencing the political process and impacting public opinion cma   o the business climate in texas continues to be favorable but is threatened by the deficit induced search for new taxes o as a result of competitive pressures texas chemical industry employment has declined  since  we have been able to successfully use the jobs issue thus far to counter the thrust toward higher taxes it has been necessary to raise tcc dues based on employee roll count to maintain program effectiveness during period of declining employment goals for  a push for state budgetary restraint with minimum need for new taxes and equitable basis for those that occur without a tax increase texas faces a biennium budget deficit of four to five billion dollars out of a total budget of around  billion dollars governor clements is expected to push for budget cuts consistent with campaign pledge legislature reluctant to make deep cuts despite fact that increases over last decade are far in excess of inflation and population growth chemical industry represents a convenient target for new taxes with several proposals aimed at broadening the sales tax base to include energy manufacturing materials contract labor and intrastate freight texas comptrollers proposal would raise chemical industry taxes by  million dollars per year which represents a  increase in state taxes lobbying effort has been effectively supported by tcc member company surveys and publications which dramatize the disastrous effect such actions would have on our industry employment and the states economy in addition to strong grassroots lobbying we are working to strengthen coalitions among other trade associations encouraging the legislature to free up dedicated funds and seeking to hold the line on agency budgets and fees cma  b gain passage of meaningful tort reform legislation texas civil justice league tcjl was established with tcc as a founding member and continuing force to help bring about reform in state tort laws there are over  tcjl members including cities railroads engineers newspapers chemical companies hospitals school districts builders and many other businesses and professions legislative objectives include  initiation of comparative responsibility in cases of joint and several liability  limitations on noneconomic and punitive damages and disposition of awards  limitations on lawyer contingency fees  pro hibitions against venue shopping  allowance of collateral source offset and use of periodic payments in lieu of lump sum awards  exclusion of prejudgment interest  limitations on liability of officers and directors of nonprofit organizations and  reduced statute of limitations for minors accomplishing such reforms will be no small task since passage in the state senate requires a twothirds majority vote and there is formidable opposition to tort reform by the texas trial lawyers developing grassroots support is critically important to success and consists of efforts to educate employees and public formation of local steering committees recruiting new tcjl members and targeting various legislators reluctant to accept tort reforms even with legislative success continuing effort must be made to elect responsible judges who will honor mandate and preserve reforms c gain passage of legislation supporting use of industry cogenerated power tcc has fostered formation of a broad based advocacy group called lect lower electrical costs for texans to discourage construction of unnecessary high cost power plants and facilitate wheeling of lower cost cogenerated power to other areas of state in need of electricity selling points are lower electrical rates achieved through more efficient use of energy and avoided construction costs and preservation of jobs by keeping the manufacturing sector competitive cwa  utility companies are strongly opposed to any change that affects their monopolistic control and ability to generate income from new investments and receive favorable rate base treatment on very expensive nuclear power plant construction nearing completion willing to discuss issues with utility companies in an effort to reach reasonable agreement negotiated or legislative success will be difficult to achieve and is largely dependent on industrys resolve to persevere d other key objectives have texas emergency response commission appointed on a basis consistent with caer utilizing existing working relationship limit control of air toxics to regulations that rely primarily on responsible self management by industry support implementation of cma air toxics program and continued progress of caer including expansion into transportation area hold chemical risk communication seminarworkshop with media agencies environmentalists and public interest groups as co sponsors achieve reasonable state implementation plan for ozone attainment and avoid costly renewable permit provision to be considered by legislature satisfactorily settle sierra club suit over texas water quality standards which tcc is involved in as an intervenor be prepared to deal with possible legislation and further regulation on groundwater protection and hazardous materials transportation gain recognition of need for more reasonable agency enforcement policies assist member companies in complying with new oshabls injuryillness recordkeeping guidelines and continue to spearhead industry efforts to fight drug abuse cma  recommendations to improve chemical industry support in texas o support plant managers in their government relations and public affairs activities stay in touch with issues acknowledge the importance of plant managers role in state and public affairs make top executives available to discuss key issues with state officials provide adequate technical resourcing so that we can maintain industry credibility and continue to favorably impact legislationregulation o join acit and tcjl if not presently involved and encourage local management to recruit suppliers and customers consciously evaluate your companys interest in lect and act accordingly o provide increased pac funds to support election of qualified conservative business oriented candidates o consider making contributions to tccs pac  freepac or at least work with tcc in coordinating effective use of industry wide funds assist state cics in defining industry economic impact of environmental issues with emphasis on jobs and competitiveness actions required board endorsement of the thrust of these recommendations cma cma  exhibit d report of health and safety committee executive summary the health and safety committee hc developed effective legislative regulatory and member services progress that verc highly successful during  in vorking with other parts of cmas organization the committee was able to achieve significant improvement in proposed federal legislation and regulations it vas also successful in promoting voluntary initiatives that enhanced cmas and the chemical industrys image among the public on the legislative front the committee vas able to improve the health provisions contained in the nev superfund lav by putting forvard alternatives better suited to meet the intent of congress these included the community righttoknow emergency preparedness and healthrelated authorities provisions in general these conform to cmas adopted policies and in many eases existing company practices significantly we made convincing arguments against proposed public compensation provisions the comittee also put forvard defensible policies on worker notification legislation proposed by congress and the state of california precluding nev legislation the committee responded to proposed regulations under several health safety and environmental lavs under epas tsca program for example the committee filed comments on proposed test guidelines inventory update regulation of intermediates comprehensive assessment information and epa penalty policies under osha cma commented on hazard cotmnunicatlon training standards laboratory substances protection and process safety reviev among others this past year the committee sought opportunities to initiate programs to benefit cmas members caer for example made significant strides to cement the program throughout our industry and many other chemical user industries we worked to ensure thac epa and state agencies and organizations recognized and endorsed caer as the principal alternative for chemical industry emergency preparedness in addition to overseeing the caer program bsc worked closely with osha and the bureau of labor statistics to adopt uniform guidelines for reporting occupational injuries and illnesses the committees efforts proved largely successful in dealing with oshas nev citation and penalty policy in  the committee also held numerous workshops to keep cma members informed on important health and safety issues a quarterly newsletter was started to supplement specific communications to cmas membership for  a strong emphasis on health and compensation programs will be the focus of the health and safety committees activities to manage the many health issues facing our industry the committee will need strong member company support and involvement of company health professionals in its programs cma   xi program overview and outlook this report marks the second year chac che health and safety committee has reported to cmas board of directors since january  when the board consolidated two standing committees and two special executive committee task groups into this standing committee considerable effort was made in last years report to describe the functional matrix adopted by hsc organization chat was put in place to handle the diverse kinds of health safety and compensation issues chac confront the chemical industry today the issues we saw this past year tested the organization and our positive results indicate that it functioned well in  the health and safety committee was faced with significant legislative threats contained in the federal superfund and worker notification bills both proposed requirements that would dramatically change the future course of chemical companies health safety and compensation programs the superfund bills drafted in early  would have required specific process safety systems in chemical plants extensive reporting of chemical mass balance information and broad expensive health programs for people with little or no significant exposure in addition a federal compensation system with changes to state tort lavs was proposed it would have greatly expanded companies liability potential the superfund amendments signed into lav reflect marked improvements in part due to cmas substituting a more sound alternative this approach typifies the committees method of advocating chemical company positions before congress and elsewhere the title iii requirements that ultimately passed has narrower reporting requirements builds on the osha hazard communication standard and embodies cmas community awareness and emergency response caer program it leaves existing tort lav intact does not provide for a new administrative compensation program and creates a healthbased assessment program consistent with sound chemical industry practices used today all in all the results of the committees priority attention and its approach to these portions of superfund reauthorization yielded significant benefits results to our industry legislation to classify workers in high healthrisk groups was successfully postponed during  the gaydos and metzenbaum worker notification bills were not taken up by the th congress for final consideration the health and safety conmlttee articulated flaws in the bills approaches and impacts on workplace health programs and argued for expanding existing requirements of oshas hazard communication standard instead success in postponing these two legislative initiatives resulted from strong teamwork among the committees task groups but equally important among the members of other departments and committees close coordination with government relations legal and communications department staffs and company representatives was essential in the success of our program alternatives in the legislative debate cma    while the committee gave legislative initiatives a high priority in  it devoted most of its effort to responding to government regulatory programs here too the health and safety committee employed a strategy of recommending better alternatives to proposed regulations to improve the final outcomes with the occupational safety and health administration for example the conaittee worked closely with the agency to develop better occupational injury and illness reporting guidelines it was also able to work with osha to improve its records inspection program and citation policy through a collaborative cmaosha educational program on recordkeeping for cma members by working with the agency to identify its program needs and concerns and advocating our members interest the couittee was able to defuse the troubling osha policy on recordkeeping finss that began with the unprecedented  million fine at institute west virginia at ea the cooiblctee focused on the agencys unbending conviction that chemical substances in general have insufficient toxicological testing to evaluate their risk to health and the environment the agency also believed that the regulatory process under the toxic substances control act tsca was too blow and cumbersome to address adequately the problem environmental interest groups concurred with ea in evaluating this situation hsc looked at how it might resolve basic concerns about the tsca program without unfavorable congressional changes to the law it concluded that participating in an informal dialogue group with all interested parties could successfully lower the concern the approach worked resulting in consensus agreements on negotiated testing and followup reporting for newchemicals in addition the process of informal discussion allowed traditional chemical industry antagonists to gain a better understanding of our concerns and needs it has opened communication channels further with the environmental interest groups and epa staff informal dialogue with traditional opposing parties remains an important committee advocacy tool while the conaittee sought to gain understanding from interest groups and agency staff it spent considerable effort in communicating to cma members it initiated aquarterly newsletter on health and safety issues which has quickly become must reading for corporate regulatory affairs managers periodic informational meetings including a program at the annual chemical industry conference are also supported strongly by bsc in addition the committee significantly increased the number of workshops seminars and roundtables that it sponsored topics included caer implementation process safety analysis and drug control programs for the workplace about a dozen such meetings gave cma members invaluable information about governmental programs member company practices methods for protecting workers and the conanmlty and operating facilities safely meeting program needs of other parts of cmas organization has also been a committee priority close ties with the distribution and environmental management consittees for example is essential for maintaining consistency in our health and safety policies for the industry many of the challenges facing these committees are driven by the publics concern about health effects from exposure to substances chat we transport or release into the environment hsc believes it is essential that we avoid inconsistency in our health policy that could cma   undermine cmas credibility and effectiveness as the chief chemical industry trade association it therefore is diligent in collaborating closely with its cma counterparts and ensuring that positions on both federal and state regulatory initiatives are consistent coordination with cmas state affairs program is monitored routinely as a result a survey of last years committee activities and programs and a look at what lies ahead indicates the health and safety comittee will likely direct a majority of its efforts at addressing health concerns to help answer comunity concerns the comittee will place high priority on the caer program the program has become even more important to the chemical industry with superfund reauthorization since emergency preparedness programs in consunltles are now required by lav caer serves as a vehicle for community compliance with the new title iii emergency response requirements it also has created a useful communications network for companies response to ocher local concerns such as health impacts of environmental releases the caer network therefore will play an important role in implementing cmas air toxics control program at the local level during  health concerns about employees exposure to chemicals in the workplace has already surfaced as a key issue for the coming year two bills introduced the first day of the new th congress will sharpen the congress oversight on worker notification and medical surveillance and could result in new legislation to address workplace health concerns the comittee will as a result spend significant effort in developing and recomending legislative policy on occupational disease assessment control and compensation it will also look for opportunities to recomend the initiation of appropriate worker health programs that could serve as models for members of the chemical industry or that regulatory agencies have envisioned for the future health concerns will likely be the focus of the debate in tsca reauthorization this year as well which will also require hscs priority attention as has been the case traditionally the bulk of hscs resources will be directed toward regulatory response new authority provided to epa and to the agency for toxic substances and disease registry in the reauthorized superfund law will greatly expand the comittees workload much work will be needed to ensure that implementing regulations are reasonable effective and not excessively costly commencing on regulations under tsca and ohsa is likely to represent the remaining bulk of the comittees regulatory activities both agencies have indicated their intent to step up the pace of their regulatory programs the comittee is confident that it is organized well to meet the challenges facing it in  as with most organizations resources will play an important role in whether it can successfully carry out its programs especially critical to the comittees success is active participation of company experts particularly vlth health science and health policy expertise the recent new legislation plus continued expansion of existing agency programs will require more than ever before added cma member company support for involving its health professionals in the health and safety comittees programs cma cma  exhibit e air toxica control policy interim report on membership survey results background the air toxics control policy was adopted by the cma board of directors on january   as part of a long standing commitment by cma member companies to operate facilities in a safe and responsible manner since the policy was adopted the association has taken significant steps to assist members in their implementation of the policy and to prepare for legislative advocacy on the issue at its september  meeting the cma board of directors approved a survey of the membership to evaluate where we stand on the implementation of the policy identify additional needs of members and prepare for the  legislative debates survey the survey document was sent on october   by mr roland to the members executive contacts asking that the information be returned by november   responses have been received with approximately  members not responding individual contacts were made with those firms not responding and a second letter from mr roland is scheduled to be mailed early this month requesting a prompt response the preliminary results of the survey indicate that o most responders have a program that tracks the cma policy and most of those programs existed before the policy was adopted the programs have been strengthened since the policy was adopted o the programs of most responders currently are in place or are underway for all facilities which in the aggregate represent over  facilities in all states except north and south dakota sixteen states have  or more facilities representing  of the total o almost all respondents use modeling or engineering techniques to conduct impact assessments very few conduct actual measurements o most respondents indicated that a variety of activities are underway to reduce emissions with most of these activities being strengthened as opposed to initiated in the last two years cma   o there is a strong correlation of the accidental release activities under the policy to the caer program o communications with outside groups are evident in the accidental release area with less or no communication to date for process emissions o most company programs do not address transportation activities o the evaluation of cma performance in implementing the policy is rated by the respondents at  to  with the highest possible rating being  euture needs the survey responses indicate the need for support or opportunities for improvement in two principle categories  first education and training support seminars workshops additional material etc and second communications better understanding of program goals and needs and assistance on communication techniques th re have been some fundamental issues raised in responses small r firms have asked for a system to prioritize their efforts and address what they perceive as small quantity  low risk situations in addition there is a recurring theme of t  me what i must do to comply cma has not provided such details in the past and none are currently planned in this program conclusion the preliminary results indicate that there is a significant amount of activity underway by members in the area covered by the policy a more complete response is needed to assess the ov rail impact of the policy upon the chemical industry as soon as the final survey results are available they will be provided to the board and the membership as well as incorporated into our advocacy programs identified needs are currently being evaluated and incorporated in planned activities action requested none for information only cma cma  exhibit f special energy advisory group interim report on activities and status of energy and petrochemical feedstock issues background on april   the cma board approved the finance and executive committees recommendation to sunset the energy committee and related program expenses as of may   to continue to monitor and evaluate energy and related petrochemical feedstock issues affecting the entire chemical industry the executive committee authorized formation of the special energy advisory group seag it was to operate without any significant duesfunded resources of cma the seag is hereby presenting an interim report on its activities and the status of energy and petrochemical feedstock issues as part of the finance committees review of program priorities for the  budget the finance committee will review the activities of the group and the status of energy issues and make a recommendation to the executive committee to either continue expand or sunset the seag for the  fiscal year  structure and accomplishments because most seag members have long been involved with energyfeedstockeconomic impact matters the cadre of sixteen experienced individuals operating as a committee of the whole see appendix were able to deal rapidly and effectively with key issues seag issue leaders are responsible for identifying specific energy legislative or regulatory initiatives having potential for significant economic impact on the chemical industry seag also has provided support for government relations action on legislative matters to determine the economic impact of changes in energy policy seag calculated chemical industry oil and gas cost at third quarter  market prices to be  billionyear proposed oil import taxes in several bills introduced in  would support crude oil at barrel and thereby increase chemical industry oil and gas costs by  billionyear while this would impact unfavorably on all manufacturing industries the chemical industry would be the most affected a wharton study shows that oil and gas costs are more than  of final chemical product costs the highest of all manufacturing sectors by way of comparison a barrel import tax on crude oil and imported petroleum products would increase chemical industry costs almost five times as much as the proposed superfund feedstock chemical tax increases which cma worked so hard and successfully to avoid in  in mid congressmen from oil producing states introduced oil import tax proposals these proposals were opposed categorically by the administration as the year progressed political pressure in oil producing states led the administration to initiate an energy security study that considered a  and barrel oil import tax seag prepared an analysis of the unfavorable impact of such a tax on the chemical industry the analysis showed a possible increase in cma  petrochemical imports from  to as high as  cma submitted the analysis to the administration and seag members explained its content in visits with members of the presidents task force although no softening of the administrations opposition to an oil import tax was evident in these visits release of the energy security study was delayed for two months to consider additional input implying a possible shift in emphasis in addition to work on energy taxes seag also accomplished the following at the request of the executive committee prepared a study of the waxman acid rain bill this study showed a potential  billionyear cost increase to the chemical industry for steam process energy and electricity this study was used by cma in the congressional debate on acid rain legislation developed materials for cmas successful effort to eliminate duplicative energy reporting addressed proposed fuel use and natural gas legislative issues and responded to ferc dockets dealing with access to competitive natural gas transportation and preferential treatment of interstate pipeline marketing affiliates  outlook increase in energy activity in  energy issues will be more active in both legislative and regulatory arenas this increase in activity is expected for the following reasons  the recent change in congressional leadership  the high priority of energyrelated environmental issues such as acid rain  increasing us dependency on foreign energy sources  deterioration of the us trade balance and  continuing budget deficits key issues as mentioned earlier oil and gas costs are more than  of final chemical product costs which is the highest of all manufacturing sectors any actions that raise oil and gas costs by such a level have a great impact on the chemical industry as an example if crude oil is supported at barrel by oil import taxes then oil and gas costs would increase  billionyear key issues that may affect energy and petrochemical feedstock costs are listed below  oil import taxes and energy security the primary energy issue will be oil import taxes and energy security measures cma  relative changes in domestic and foreign oil and gas costs are vitally important to international competitiveness of the us chemical industry  energy cost impact of environmental regulation energy cost is also a major consideration in determining the economic impact of environmental legislation and regulation there is a need to evaluate the energy cost implications of environmental controls  natural gas issues regulatory changes affecting cost supply and access to transportation of natural gas will continue to effect chemical industry costs cma needs to respond to those initiatives or propose more appropriate initiatives geared to making gas markets more competitive in   energy productivity finally there exists continued concern on capitol hill and in the administration that energy productivity is being lost with lower current energy costs cma needs to be prepared to show that the industrial energy conservation ethic has not been lost even though  legislation has eliminated the industrial energy conservation reporting program  competitiveness issue cma members have a vital interest in government policies affecting energy and petrochemical feedstocks because they are of substantial economic significance and determine the competitiveness and long term viability of our industry proposed trade legislation and regulations must be reviewed by seag in coordination with cmas international trade committee to assess the economic impact of energy cost changes related to those bills seag operation and resources in  seag operated with minimal staff assistance and no funding for additional economic studies or other outside support seag has operated efficiently but in view of renewed congressional interest in energy taxes and other energy issues the current cma resources will likely not be adequate to meet the needs of the industry in addition the group effort has been tied to economic impact studies prepared in  and  these studies must be updated to be relevant in the  energy debate action required none at this time  for information only issue information and potential resource requirements will be submitted to the finance committee for its consideration with respect to the  operations of seag cma cma  exhibit g report of the chairman special programs policy committee to the cma board of directors january   the special programs policy committee was chartered by the board of directors in  on behalf of the executive committee and board and in conjunction with cma standing committees sppc helps ensure that all special programs are conducted in a manner consistent with association policy and with the special programs guidelines it also counsels with special programs regarding the appropriateness of current policy provisions and reviews reports and recommendations from the special programs division staff regarding new and revised operating procedures sppc recommendations for changes of policy are reported to the executive committee and board of directors via the president for final approval and action in the past year sppc has received no requests from special program panel chairmen to review current policy to ensure that the views of chairmen are obtained and in keeping with its mandate sppc plans to meet in the next few months with a representative group of panel chairmen the purpose of the meeting will be to solicit the chairmens views on adequacy and appropriateness of current policy provisions in the past year no conflicts between conduct of special programs and association policy have been noted by sppc in our opinion program actions and cma policy remain in concert based on these observations we conclude that the safeguards implicit in the sppc process are adequately serving the special programs and the association we recommend contin uation of this oversight mechanism in keeping with this recommendation we also wish to remind the board of its suggestion in  that all single product consortia be chartered under the umbrella ctf a trade association the reason given for this suggestion was that ad hoc groups actions may  adversely affect the contin uity consistency of position and longterm litigation plans of cma or allied organizations just as importantly affilia tion with a trade association more effectively shields consortia from implications of antitrust violations than does ad hoc status and thereby helps protect member companies while most single product consortia now affiliate with a trade association there remain a few that do not membership in each of these hoc croups includes cma member companies we ask that you evaluate ycur companys participation in these groups and take steps to bring the aa hoc consortia into an association cma cma  exhibit h executive sunnnary international trade committee annual report to cma board of directors january   the competitive position of the us chemical industry in world markets is increasingly affected by policies of both us and foreign governments cmas international trade committee itc devotes the majority of its efforts to analyzing issues affecting trade related matters alerting cma members to these issues and developing position papers for cma board approval that will help influence government trade and investment policies which affect the international competitiveness of the us chemical industry both the administration and the congress have indicated that during  much attention and emphasis is going to be placed on the competitiveness of all domestic industries in the international marketplace this emphasis will probably translate into changes in current us laws policies and practices in areas including trade investment fiscal and monetary worker education third

congress prepares to convene on january th we will return to a more familiar type of government  a republican white house and a democrat controlled congress amid the changes wrought by a shift in control of the senate both republicans and democrats moved quickly to reelect their current leaders for another two years senate majority leader robert c byrd dwv has stated that after congress convenes senate democrats will begin legislative work january  breaking with recent congressional tradition of waiting until after the presidents state of the union address scheduled for january  house speaker jim wright dtx has said that congress could within a month clear legislation reauthorizing the clean water act which president reagan killed by pocket veto last year it is also anticipated that congress will move quickly to authorize special committees to investigate the iran armscontra aid affair introduce trade legislation and begin tackling the administrations record  trillion  budget proposal the administration has estimated the deficit at about  billion while the congressional budget office and other analysts have estimated it at closer to  billion house budget committee chairman william h gray iii dpa has said that to meet deficit goals congress may be forced to consider tax increases citing as examples without touching personal income tax changing the nations tariff system and increasing surcharges on some imported products other issues that will confront the th congress and which are of particular concern to the chemical industry include pesticide and acid rain legislation product liability and emphasis on work place concerns  an area where labor shows signs of greater political activity trade reform legislation another priority of the new congress will most likely be protectionist and cma is prepared to take an active role in the forthcoming debate with positions on numerous facets of existing trade law with the current agenda and the usual uncertainties of a new session  will be another busy and difficult year for the congress cma  f federal regulatory agencies environmental protection agency fepa the agency has announced its intention to use superfund monies to fund righttoknow activities required by title iii of the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of  cma key members of congress and some press reporters have already spoken out against bleeding the superfund to carry out activities required by other statutes title iii is in fact a separate act from cercla much like the clean air act or clean water act epas difficulty lies in the fact that congress created deadlines under title iii but failed to provide any funds to conduct those programs international house and senate leaders insist they will have a trade bill to the president by may with control of the senate now held by the democrats the commitment seems firm even though the house passed a bill last year and the senate almost did there are some uncertainties new and tougher actions against imports are certain to be included the textlieapparel bill vetoed by the president last year sustained may be included senator bentsen now chairman of the senate finance committee says he will likely include an oil import tax the president says he wants nothing in a trade bill except authority to negotiate the multilateral trade negotiations min whether he can or whether he will work with the congress on an acceptable bill is not known now there is almost no common ground for the white house and congress and the result may be a veto battle bargaining in the mtn has started with all the usual fighting for position by participants not much progress can be announced in the early months but much groundwork will be laid the chemical industry wants no tariff cuts on products proved to be import sensitive attempts to get legislative language to this effect are underway the uscanada negotiations toward a free trade arrangement is moving along though with difficulties constantly appearing canadian officials are hardpressed by opponents of an agreement pressure grows for settlement by late in  to beat the presidents bargaining authorization limit of january   there is considerable doubt this deadline can be met preliminary data shows that the  percent decline of the chemical trade balance in the period  has reversed the estimate is for a  billion dollar balance a  percent increase over the year before most of the credit goes to a weaker dollar the international affairs group iag has undertaken an effort to ensure greater cooperation among chemical trade associations worldwide several foreign trade associations have expressed interest in maintaining closer contact with cma and the new effort will  cma  attempt to increase the iags visibility as a contact and advocate for the us chemical industry on an international scale the iag believes that interaction with our foreign counterparts may profitably be made on the emerging global issues affecting health safety and the environment states during the last two months of  less than six state legislatures were in session however there were a few significant state government activities of major significance to the chemical industry without doubt the most significant event was the passage of the california toxic initiative or proposition  despite a major public relations campaign by industry the initiative was approved  to  the industry coalition will remain intact to address the implementation of the new law the first deadline is march   when the governor must publish a list of affected chemicals on march   the warning provisions go into effect and on november   the discharge prohibitions become effective after a thorough legal review of all possible options the coalition decided to delay any legal attempts to postpone or to alter the law until after its implementation has begun the cma state affairs committee has established a special ad hoc group to help develop a response to this law in california as well as its potential spread to other states state legislative action will reach a peak in the next couple of months as all but a couple of states will be in session tort reformiiiability insurance will continue to be a major issue among the states in  while some sort of tort reform legislation was passed in  states in  injuries involving hazardous substances were partially or in some cases completely excluded from some of the significant reforms following the third circuit courts decision to essentially uphold the pennsylvania righttoknow law there was an appeal to the united states supreme court until the court decides whether or not to accept the case there is an injunction against the implementation of the law as it applies to manufacturers thanks in part to the efforts of the new jersey chemical industry council the council of state governments csg deferred action on the possible adoption of the new jersey environmental responsibility cleanup act ecra as model legislation however some form of ecra model legislation will be adopted by csg in  and cmas ecra work group continues to work towards a favorable model chemical plant safety will als continue to be a major issue among the states in  and the cma state affairs environmental management work group has developed an issue analysis document that was recently distributed to member companies and state cics  in summary  should be a very active year for the chemical industry at the state level in the november elections the public again spoke strongly for increased environmental protection by state government they also elected a majority of democrats to the extent that  out  state houses are now controlled by democrats this will be an increasingly formidable task this year in light of member company state affairs staff reductions media beginning in november media coverage of business news increased substantially  accounting for nearly  percent of the news in major national newspapers and on network television recent irancontra coverage has interrupted the growth in business news but it remains a substantial part of coverage over the past several years coverage of business news was essentially positive business was seen as offering an alternative to governmental problem solving recently however nearly  percent of coverage has been negative setting a dark background for legislative and regulatory activities issues like insider trading chemical spills ozone depletion water contamination and charges of poor management have led the charge the rush of yearend takeovers accelerated the level of nervousness in coverage ivan boesky and the fallout from the sec investigation confirmed for many americans deep suspicions about wall street and by extension about business ethics even a baby food manufacturer was charged with dilution of its product several members of the chemical industry were charged with illegal product formulation add a lack of trust in the presidents handling of iran and contra aid and public bad feelings about big government and big business have again surfaced although water issues have been slow to develop in the us the h avy coverage of contamination problems in switzerland have raised public awareness even a minor event in this country could bring extensive coverage and perhaps force earlier consideration of water issues in congress finally even though editorial opinion in california newspapers was overwhelmingly opposed to proposition   no  yes popular press coverage was just as overwhelmingly in support of it the hollywood stars press caravan organized by jane fonda offered interviews and media events and worked well in gaining popular votes the same tactic will be less usable in other states the latest public opinion polls show most americans today believe companies are more concerned than they used to be about waste disposal but by a twothirds majority they say they dont see enough action to solve the problems by the highest record in the  cma  cambridge reports history  percent of americans are calling for more environmental regulation even though they do not see environmental conditions getting worse theyre just tired of waiting for action issues and program status regulation of chemicals ftsca and related  congressional developments and response

requirements recently adopted in the th congress its administration by the environmental protection agency continues to evolve and mature while other various legislative changes have been proposed in past years none have been acted upon by congress expenditures under the act have not been reauthorized since fy  as the agency has relied upon the appropriations process for funding consequently tsca

cleanup standards at a superfund site epa is attempting to provide some flexibility in the cleanup standards but congressional critics contend the new law does not allow that flexibility we can expect that congress will conduct oversight hearings on this issue also there have been reports that epa may be using superfund money for the implementation of title iii the righttoknow section in passing superfund congress specifically made title iii separate from superfund and said that it should receive funding through the appropriation process this was intended to mean that the superfund trust fund money would not be used for title iii cma sent a letter december   to epa administrator lee thomas expressing our concern with his attempt to use superfund money to implement title iii the government

litigation and related legal activities insurance litigation activities following up on discussions at the first meeting of the ad hoc group on superfundinsurance issues the office of general counsel has filed amicus briefs in two important insurance coverage cases the issues in these cases concern when an occurrence occurs for purposes of environmental liabilities under comprehensive general liability cgl policies and whether superfund cleanup costs can be considered as damages under cgl policies both issues will have an important impact on whether member  cma  companies can seek coverage for superfund liabilities under cgl policies the insurance industry has apparently formed a corporation to act as the funding source and coordinating body to pursue its activities in key insurance cases in response the office of general counsel is seeking the participation of other interested associations to organize to respond on behalf of insured companies in some of these cases regulatory litigation the office of general counsel is currently engaged in two key court actions challenging regulations in the superfund area in the national contingency plan ncp litigation cma and the other petitioners are meeting with the government to discuss possible resolution of the challenge in light of superfund reauthorization and the forthcoming revision of the ncp required by that statute in the other suit cma has challenged the final natural resource damage assessment regulations promulgated by the department of interior several states and one environmental group have also challenged the regulations the litigation is in a preliminary stage pending consolidation of the eases and the setting of a briefing schedule by the court superfund implementation activities as part of its superfund implementation effort the office of general counsel will be working with the ad hoc superfund counsel group to pursue ways to improve the settlement process under superfund this group includes superfund lawyers from member companies who are interested in sharing concerns arising out of their superfund case experiences as part of its activities the group will be looking at epa and department

groups continue to be very active in reviewing the rcra regulations and providing guidance for their implementation in preparation for the th congress both the technical and government relations task groups have been discussing issues that they believe need to be addressed in the rcra reauthorization debate the task groups have identified a number of issues of potential concern to the chemical industry these issues will be used as a starting point for discussion of possible legislative changes  cma  cma is actively communicating with members of congress and hill staff who will be working on rcra issues in the next congress oversight hearings will be held throughout  on various aspects of rcra the rcra task group will he conducting two important activities early in  first they will conduct a seminarbriefing for cma washington representatives on the  rcra amendments implementation and the outlook for legislative changes in  the second task group activity would be a briefing by cma for key hill staff on rcra implementation and its impact on the chemical industry this would create an opportunity to discuss with key hill staff some of the technical problems the chemical industry faces and how we perceive implementation of the  rcra amendments rcra oversight hearings can be anticipated throughout  in the senate senator max baucus dmt will be taking the lead in the rcra reauthorization in the house we expect congressman john dingell dmi and congressman jim florio dnj to be the most active in rcra oversight hearings the rcra debate will evolve slowly with the oversight hearings focusing on epas implementation of the  amendments cma will continue to provide information to key members of congress and their staff waste minimization program the resource conservation and recovery act rcra requires that companies establish voluntary waste minimization programs for their operations and certify their actions in  rcra is scheduled to be reauthorized at that time congress will closely evaluate the progress that has been made in the waste minimization program if progress is inadequate congress will seriously consider legislating mandatory waste reduction requirements many cma member companies have a wellestablished waste minimization program in place the companies have generally not communicated this activity and its results to the public and congress cmas waste minimization work group is developing a plan for communicating with member companies the congress and epa and the general public cma has been meeting with congressional staff to discuss this issue at this point it appears that waste minimization will be a priority issue over the next few years it is very important that cma member companies focus on this issue now although very little activity is expected in the first part of  waste minimization will be an emerging issue over the next two years underground inlection committee the  rcra amendments require epa to determine whether underground injection should remain an option for the disposal of hazardous waste several environmental groups led by the natural resources defense council nrdc have made the elimination of underground injection one of their major  cma  priorities an epa ban on new legislation prohibiting underground injection would directly affect the chemical industry which is the major user of underground injection for the disposal of hazardous waste in an effort to answer the nrdc opposition to underground injection the cma underground injection control task group has been contacting congressmen who have disposal wells in their districts to reassure them about the safety of the technology these contacts are expected to continue on a regular basis as long as environmentalist opposition to underground injection persists although no hearings will be held specifically on underground injection in early  we expect the issue to be addressed in rcra oversight hearings throughout the year the introduction of any groundwater legislation may also touch upon the practice of underground injection cma will continue to comnunicata with congress on underground injection the issue will begin to receive more attention when congress returns in january   regulatory developments and response land disposal prohibition comments cma submitted comments on epas

that if there is insufficient capacity to treat a waste the waste can be placed in an existing unit that is not doublelined for up to two years while capacity is being developed cma plans to challenge other aspects of epas final rule specifically cma will challenge the fact that the treatment levels required for solvents and dioxins are set at concentrations that are even below the concentrations epa proposes to use for considering such compounds to be hazardous wastes cma will also challenge epas limitation of no migration petitions to individual wastes at individual units no migration petitions seek an exception from the ban on land disposal finally cma may challenge epas requirement to use a zero headspace extractor zhe for volatiles when assessing the concentration of wastes to determine if they can be landfilled the variability of the zhe is excessive organic leachate model cma has petitioned for review of the agencys november   rule adopting the organic leachate model for delisting organic wastes in landfills cma will challenge epas refusal to adopt criteria for considering sitespecific factors when deciding to delist hazardous waste nonconsideration of sitespecific

cma has been developing its advocacy position on federal groundwater legislation cma continues to believe groundwater protection is an important issue federal legislation could establish new concepts for groundwater protection or remediation activities which will likely result in significant costs to the industry it could also impose use restrictions on certain products such as pesticides detergents solvents and others it may also result in new concepts concerning product liability including federal causes of action victims compensation and new taxing mechanisms cma has been a major participant in groundwater issues to date cma took an active role in epas development of its national groundwater policy which was released in august  cma has worked with several state legislatures an area that has been particularly active in recent years congressional testimony was presented on four occasions addressing both groundwater provisions in the safe drinking water act and most recently in october  directly on groundwater protection issues the government relations committees groundwater task group has already begun educating key congressional staff on some of the fundamental policy issues for example cma has long felt that states and not the federal government should have primary  cma   litigation and related legal activities rmcl litigation briefing is now completed in the dc circuit case challenging epas recommended maximum contaminant levels rmcls for eight synthetic organic substances epa has filed its response to the briefs filed by cma and the american petroleum institute api jointly the halogenated solvents industry alliance hsia and the natural resources defense council nrdc on october   the challenging parties filed their additional briefs replying to the epa position cma and api filed separate reply briefs api concentrating on the zero rmcl issue and cma briefing the issue raised by nrdc of whether epa must regulate a substance as a carcinogen if there is anv evidence of carcinogenicity oral argument will be held on february   a decision is expected in late summer or fall  surface water  congressional developments and response the th congress unanimously passed the water quality act of  s  just prior to adjournment on october  cma sent a letter to president reagan urging him to sign the compromise bill based upon the programmatic content the president vetoed the bill on novembar  citing the sir milton price tag for the construction grants program in the th congress house and senate leaders have vowed to introduce the same bill as hr  and s  they plan to avoid referral of the bill to committee and to seek house and senate passage despite threats of floor amendments and another presidential veto while committee and subcommittee chairmen responsible for clean water have changed in both the senate and the house the new leaders say that they are equally committed to passage of the same bill cma continues to be generally supportive of legislation identical to the former s  and is working to make certain that the valuable floor statements that supplemented s  are repeated and not compromised by opponents statements cma maintains communication with other industry and municipal groups regarding clean water legislation but continues to serve as the industry leader on its primary issues  litigation and related legal activities pesticides effluent guidelines litigation on december   epa published a notice in the federal register removing the pesticides effluent guidelines from the code of federal regulations and announcing that those rules have not been effective as of july   this action was taken as a result of the cmanaca lawsuit challenging the pesticide rules epa has informed cma and naca that the agency plans to start fresh in developing the next set of effluent guidelines for the pesticides industry epa will undertake a  cma  new data collection effort and will also reevaluate policy and technical aspects of the methodology used to develop the previous effluent guidelines epa does not expect to issue a new set of final rules before june  removal credits litigation the federal government has decided not to file an appeal of the third circuits removal credits decision instead on december   the government filed a brief with the supreme court responding to the petitions filed by cma and by a group of affected parties from chicago the government agreed with cma that the third circuit ruled incorrectly on the sludge issue and agreed with cma that the case would have major impacts on industry nevertheless the government recommended that the court not hear the case because the government does not believe that the legal issues presented warrant further review nrdcs response to cmas petition was due january  air  congressional developments and response when the th congress adjourned all of the acid rain bills  house and senate  had been hindered by interregional conflict and slowed by opposition from electricity producers and users including the chemical industry the only legislation that passed pertaining to clean air was title iii of superfund amendments reauthorization act covering emissions reporting emergency planning and community righttoknow early in  the clean air act amendments debate is likely to resume with focus on acid rain control legislation thus there probably will be time to consider other amendments to the clean air act three major issues are the  nonattainment deadlines for ozone and carbon monoxide air toxics control and fluorocarbon control by spring  clean air hearings probably will be underway in both the house and senate the change in senate leadership does not affect the environment and public vorks committees agenda for air legislation but it does put new majority deader robert byrd dwva in a unique position to influence the outcome of any air legislation that contains an onerous acid rain control provision in the house energy and commerce committee chairman john dingell dmi remains opposed to onerous acid rain control legislation however ranking minority member norman lent rny was a cosponsor f the major houae acid rain control bill in the th congress until all members of the committee and of the health and environment subcommittee are selected it is difficult to assess potential votes  cma is a major participant in the interindustry coalition on clean air cma provides the leadership on the hazardous air pollutants control issue but maintains strong input on other stationary source issues including acid rain   air toxica policy imp lamentation air toxica resource manual cma has published a comprehensive resource manual to assist members in implementing the air toxics control policy the resource manual was mailed to each member companys air toxics coordinator additional copies are available at reproduction cost upon request the manual provides valuable information to assist member companies in designing appropriate programs to minimize accidental releases and to control process emissions copies of the resource manual are being provided to epa state agencies and other concerned parties workshop on emission imrentorles and assessments cma has developed a twoday workshop to provide emissions inventory and assessments information that will assist member companies in the implementation of an air toxics control program the workshop held on january   highlights included o o o o o o emission inventory techniques updated fugitive emissions procedures notification and reporting requirements modeling for accidental releases screening methodologies and modeling for routine releases an epa spokesman will address epas publication implementing the epa air toxics policy and d e wenger of the university of delaware disaster research center will address human response during crisis communications workshop  air toxics control policy cma has developed a workshop in response to many member companies requests for assistance in how to communicate air toxics issues the workshop held on january   addressed risk issues and how to build on existing caer networks the workshop used a handson approach with individual participants working through the steps needed to develop communications messages and action plans for their own facilities state accidental release prevention and control issue analysis the environmental management committee has developed for use by the state affairs committee an issue analysis on accidental release prevention and control the document develops guidance that is consistent with existing cma policy that is readily usable by cma member companies in state activities the objective is to obtain relatively uniform and rational state and local regulations that upgrade control of all sources handling significant quantities of highly toxic materials without penalizing sources already performing to good industry practices  grassroots activities congressional liaison representatives clrs are establishing district coalitions of chemical company representatives and other parties with an interest in air toxics legislation these coalitions are meeting to review the issue and tailor a specific message around  cma  cma general principles on air toxics meetings between the coalitions and key legislators will be held during the spring and summer to educate legislators on industry operations and cmas positions members of congress have been identified as key members on air toxics on the basis of membership on the congressional committees of jurisdiction as well as a large industry constituent presence in their districts the list of members so identified for activity in the grassroots program will be reviewed as new congressional committee assignments are made and revised accordingly  regulatory developments and response industrial boilers new source performance standards cma submitted comments on epas proposed standards of performance for new stationary sources lndustrialcommcrcialinstitutional steam generating units cma criticized the  reduction requirement as neither practical nor cost effective for small boilers cma recommended that the agency set emission limits that can be met by either fuel election precleaning or scrubbing whichever is most cost effective in addition cma noted that the proposed nsps is inconsistent with other important national goals in this regard it contradicts us energy policy by discouraging the use of coal our most abundant energy resource additionally the effects of the proposed regulation could run counter to the intent of the clean air act in reducing emissions the unrealistic requirement for so emission reductions could encourage continued operation of existing less efficient boilers cma urged epa to reconsider its proposal and issue a less onerous standard which would not deter the use of coal and would be cost effective  litigation and related activities vinvl chloride litigation cma won a major victory in a case involving section  of the clean air act the decision provides epa with more discretion in setting reasonable clean air standards cma participated in this esse supporting epas position that the agency can consider cost and technological feasibility in setting emission standards the natural resources defense council nrdc argued that section  permits only the consideration of healthbased factors therefore in their view epa could not take into account cost and technological feasibility the us court of appeals for the dc circuit however held that epa has some discretion in setting emission standards its november   decision affirmed that epa had acted reasonably in withdrawing proposed amendments on vinyl chloride after considering the cost to industry and the technological feasibility of compliance  cma  nrdc has asked for a rehearing of the case if the decision is upheld it is expected to affect similar litigation involving benzene and radionuclides standards benzene and radionuclides litigation on november   cma filed supplemental briefs in the benzene and the radionuclides litigation with the us court of appeals for the dc circuit the briefs were requested by the court to help assess the impact of the recent vinyl chloride decision on these two cases both involve an issue similar to that in the vinyl chloride case whether epa may consider cost and technological feasibility in setting emission standards oral argument has been scheduled for may    communications communications department is producing an issues book for the ad hoc accidental release prevention and control group distribution is targeted for midjanuary the book will describe legislative and regulatory issues focused on prevention and control of accidental releases from chemical facilities a seminar on air toxics policy communication was conducted for an expected  attendees in houston the seminar targeted for plant managers was designed to assist those attending develop site specific communication plans with the support of the communications committee and cmas communications staff the louisiana chemical

developments and response hazardous materials transportation act the hazardous materials transportation act hmta was scheduled to be considered for reauthorization in the th congress with the exception of one day of hearings before a subcommittee no action was taken on the matter funding to continue the activities which the act regulates was included in the continuing resolution which congress passed just prior to adjournment as the act contains no sunset provisions officials at the department of transportation are satisfied that for the time being this congressional action was sufficient to maintain the programs covered by the act nevertheless it is anticipated that there are a number of congressmen who would like to see the act reopened for additional amendments accordingly extensive activity on hmta is expected in the th congress cma plans to take the position paper approved by the board last january and draft proposed legislative language which could be used for the acts reauthorization the government relations committees  cma  transportation task group will visit key congressmen during the first part of the year seeking sponsors for cmas suggested revisions to the existing law driver licensing the drug bill which passed the congress at the end of the last session included provisions dealing with the commercial licensing of truck drivers currently there are no national standards the new law would still allow drivers to be licensed by individual states but will establish a system which will not allow multiple state licenses as is now the case the new standards must be in effect by  cma has been in favor of requirements which would require only a single commercial license for drivers incident reporting in the closing days of the last congress a law was enacted to reauthorize superfund under the righttoknow provisions of title iii of the law reauthorizing superfund some additional requirements have been added on the reporting of spills of hazardous materials in addition to the current requirements that incidents must be reported to the national response center the incident must now also be reported to the local emergency responder requests for comments on proposed rulemaking in this area are currently being solicited and cma plans to file comments  regulatory developments and response shipping act review the federal maritime administration with cmas cooperation has begun to receive input from chemical shippers on the favorable as well as unfavorable aspects of the shipping act of  the distribution committee has prioritized its advocacy plans high priority items include prohibit ocean carrier conferences deregulate authority over service contracts continue mandatory right of independent action and prohibit cargo reservation bilaterals marpol annex ii cma filed comments with the us coast guard on its proposed rules implementing the marpol annex ii provisions for the international bulk shipment of chemicals by vessels much of the cma comments focused on the procedures for cleaning cargo ships and disposal of residue marpol annex iii cma provided the us coast guard with technical comments on a position paper the coast guard plans to introduce before the un international maritime organization the paper focuses on the expansion of the international requirements for packaged chemical shipments to additional classes of materials cma convinced coast guard to modify its position paper district of columbia hazardous materials study commission cma is represented on a special commission established by the district of columbia to assess the potential risks posed by the transportation of hazardous materials and to form the districts policies towards controlling these risks  tank car allowance system cma joined with other tank car providers in submitting comments to the interstate commerce commission in reply to the railroads petition for clarification on the tank car allowance system cma supported the commissions interpretation of how the rules should be applied cma noted that the parties to the negotiated agreement which was subsequently adopted by the commission decided to leave for future resolution the evidence that would be relevant in the investigation of a departure from the national tank car allowance system railroad cost recovery procedures the supreme court has denied the railroads last ditch effort to obtain a stay of the iccs decision served october  in ex parte  sub no  railroad cost recovery procedures cma had already filed a reply with the commission opposing the railroads request for a stay the effeet of the cancellation will be to roll back set recovery based rates to the december  level peru cargo reservation cma sent comments to the federal maritime commission urging them to seek an injunction of the equal access agreements regarding usperu trade cma noted that such agreements would institutionalize cargo reservation in the usperu trade and would subsequently pose severe limitations on the competitive service of thirdflag carriers that have previously been offering the most frequent and reliable service brazil bilateral cma sent a letter to the department of transportation urging nonrenewal of the usbrazilian bilateral agreement on cargo reservation the bilateral condones brazils cargo reservation laws which require us exporters to ship approximately  percent of their tonnage on us or brazilian flag vessels cma noted that us chemical exportersshippers arc seriously hampered by these requirements notwithstanding cmas urging the us signed a threeyear agreement that would continue cargo reservation in the trade one bright spot is that the agreement does not condone the reservation of bulk cargo hazardous substances cma furnished the department of transportation with comments outlining problems the chemical industry will have in trying to comply with the provisions of the superfund amendments and reauthorization act calling for the regulation of hazardous substances for transportation  policy development analytical and program activities transportation risk management work is continuing on the development of a chemical transportation risk management system individual company programs are being analyzed for generic features that can be used industrywide to further safeguard against the accidental release of chemicals cma and the association of american railroads have jointly reviewed several systems with the intent to develop a rail chemical transportation risk management model individual shippers and carriers could use this model to assess the relative risk of various routes and containers  cma  warehouse safety program the distribution and health and safety committees have formed a joint working group to develop a program to enhance the safe storage of chemicals in warehouses this group has reviewed several existing chemical company programs and is now developing a general package that companies can use when reviewing the safety programs of individual warehouses distribution outreach activities the distribution committees outreach task group is currently revising the cma publication transporting chemicals safely this will be used as part of the committees efforts to communicate the positive steps the chemical industry has taken to reduce the probability of an accidental release during transportation expansion of the caer program to transportation the distribution committee and the health and safety committee have joined forces to promote the expansion of the community awareness and emergency response program to the transportation community local communities that are exposed to the transportation of chemicals should have emergency response contingency plans in place cma is working with representatives of the trucking industry to reach these communities with the caer program national chemical response and information center ncric  chemtrec chemtrec ended  with a record number of calls  for the first time emergency reports received exceeded   actual in a years time over  call volume increased  included in this increase was a surge in medical emergencies and other nontransportation emergencies and a modest increase in transportation emergencies chemtrec now has two communicators on duty from  am pm monday through friday to accommodate this change chemtrec adopted a day shift rotation work schedule versus the day rotation in use since  the new shift schedule offers several distinct advantages namely fewer night shifts to work  versus  and a doubling of weekends off  versus  the new schedule should go a long way toward reducing jobrelated stress and increase morale a total of  chemical records are now loaded in the chemical database there are now  generic guides for the chemtrec emergency response guide library chemtrec has provided caer with its requirements for participating in communitywide emergency drills for hazardous materials and has been involved in two caerrelated drills interest in the hazard information transmission hit program continues apace since the last report there have been  inquiries about the program hit brochures have been mailed to each currently  cma  there are  active participants located in  states and  applicants being processed the salvage drum cooperative

december chemtrec responded to three incidents involving either foreign producers or shippers on december  the suffren new york fire department was called to an apparent fire in a japanese restaurant it turned out that a fumigant was being used to kill insects firefighters were exposed to the fumes label markings on the container were in japanese with the only clue in english being the word chugai which it turns out means bug an overseas call to the japanese producer did not yield results but the manufacturers phone number was passed to the fire department for product identification at a later

chemical referral center working from a computer database that now contains product profiles on  chemicals the chemical referral center crc continues to assist approximately  callers per month between december  and december  the crc responded to over  requests from the general public for nonemergency health and safety information on chemicals the crc staff have been working on a report describing the centers activities during its first year of operation this document will be distributed to the  chemical companies currently participating in the crc emergency response training lending library in fifteen months of operation the lending library has loaned more than  training programs to emergency response personnel in the public sector these programs have been shown to more than  emergency responders there are fourteen programs in the library and we have identified several new programs that will be added  cma  first responder training programs the most popular training program in the library is still first on the scene the first responder training videotape produced by cma more than a thousand copies have been borrowed from the library and over  copies have been distributed free or sold at the cost of reproducing the tape the canadian center for occupational safety and health is planning to convert the tape into french and distribute it in canada the new videotape training program teamwork  safe handling of a hazardous materials incident should be ready for distribution at the end of january this program stresses the need for preplanning establishing who is in charge and the various roles of the responders identifying sources of assistance and how to activate them the need to work with the media and the importance of a postincident critique these points are demonstrated in a scenario involving an overturned tank truck that is leaking a flammable poisonous material the scenario takes you through each phase of the incident from the time it happened through cleanup and the critique it will be an excellent sequel to first on the scene the second standard phraseology manual on all types of packagings used to transport chemicals is in the final review

competitiveness  congressional developments and response omnibus trade law leaders of both houses of congress say that a trade bill will be ready for the presidents signature by may  that may be a very ambitious goal extensive hearings were held in the house of representatives during the last congress producing an equally extensive trade bill hr  which the administration promised to veto while the hearings on the senate side were also numerous the finance committee failed to report a bill the finance committee of course has a new look in the current congress with control of the senate back to the democratic party senator bentsen plans to introduce a bill which is unlikely to be either like the bill considered previously by the senate s  or over the last year cmas international trade committee itc has been providing the board of directors with suggested positions on needed modifications to a number of elements of existing trade law consequently cma is in an excellent position to react to legislative overtures on any proposal for a new omnibus trade bill cma is continuing its lobbying efforts on trade matters through the covemment relations committeea trade task group and through the coalition known as the office of the chemical industry trade advisor cita ocitas primary focus is on assuring that any new trade  cma  legislation contains language which would exempt import sensitive items from tariff reduction considerations in addition to the failure of the previous congress to pass any omnibus trade bill it also failed to give final passage to the numerous miscellaneous trade and tariff measures which provide for temporary reductions or suspensions of duty on specified items socma also a member of ocita is attempting to have legislation introduced which would allow for temporary duty suspension matters to proceed administratively the itc is currently examining this issue to determine whether to recommend that the cma endorse the socma initiative  international negotiationsagreements tariff negotiations the next round of multilateral trade n gotiations mtn which will be known as the uruguay round has g tten underway when the ministers of the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt met in uruguay in september  they agreed with great difficulty on an agenda for the negotiations the last mtn known as the tokyo round resulted in staged reductions of tariffs which concluded with the last reduction occurring on january   while there is no certainty on how long the negotiations will continue the united states is hopeful that some agreements can be reached within the next few years the possibility of such a rapid agreement may be optimistic traditionally mtn rounds have been extremely lengthy processes because of the protracted nature of the discussions cma members face the danger of losing interest in a process which will profoundly affect their daily operations the international trade committee itc is fully committed to keeping industry activity at an appropriate level cma has already hosted a seminar to inform its members of both the process of the negotiations and the expected agendas that the major gatt participants will bring to the discussions the cma itc is currently contemplating the formation of a list of chemicals that the govememnt should investigate to determine the products degree of import sensitivity in addition a list of objectives sought by the industry is also being considered both activities are in response to overtures made to the industry by the office of the us trade representative and the department of conanerce  legal preshipment inspection and customs valuation procedures conducted by private companies on behalf of foreign governments in september the office of the us trade representative ustr reviewed a section  trade remedy petition filed by representatives of us industry this petition contested the quality quantity and price inspections conducted in the united states by private preshipment inspection companies that act as agents for governments of twentythree developing countries  cma  inspection companies have been known arbitrarily to reject a us exporters price and change the value of the goods for customs purposes in the importing country before clearing them for shipment moreover in conducting their product and price comparisons the inspection companies request confidential business information from exporters often with inadequate assurances for protection from disclosure many us exporters including us chemical companies the majority of negative comments received by ustr on this subject came from us chemical and pharmaceutical companies are having difficulty meeting contractual delivery requirements in countries which require such preshipment clearance and financial settlements are being delayed these practices also arguably violate a number of international agreements in late october ustr decided not to initiate a formal section  trade investigation instead it is negotiating bilaterally with each of the twentythree governments involved on an expedited basis in addition the us international trade commission usitc has initiated a study on the impact of these preshipment inspection companies on us industry trade as part of this study questionnaires are being sent to us companies including cma member companies it is important that these questionnaires be filled out and returned so that the usitc can have an accurate reading of the burdens put on industry by these preshipment practices cma is working in an informal industry coalition to ensure that the chemical industrys concerns are addressed in the ustr negotiations and usitc study  communieations the department coordinated activities for cmas annual economic news briefing including development of materials for the briefing collateral distribution of the briefing materials and arrangements for oneonone interviews with key cma staff taxation  congressional developments and response the size complexity and mistakes of the  tax reform act are strong reasons to believe congress will again consider major tax legislation in  in addition many related legislative areas such as trade legislation which are high on the  congressional agenda may contain important tax provisions for example changes in foreign tax treatment for these reasons cma again anticipates substantial regulatory and legislative tax activity in the coming year the tax policy committee has established a tax reform implementation task group to identify legislative and regulatory issues arising from the  legislation the task group has divided its assignments among five working groups that are now developing written materials on specific subject areas the tax policy committee and the government relations committee will develop a comprehensive tax legislative work plan as more detail of the congressional agenda  cma  unfolds although the th congress will not convene until midjanuary the cma tax program for the new year is well underway patents and protection of technology  congress patent term restoration patent term restoration ptr legislation was amended to the reauthorization of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra which failed to be accepted by the senate in the final days of the th congress the agrichemicals industry became involved in negotiating changes to fifra largely because a group of environmentalists objected to ptr legislation in the th congress the environmentalists lobbied congress and said that so long as the industry refused to cooperate in a rewrite of fifra the environmental groups would actively oppose any legislation to extend the patents on pesticides in september  the house passed fifra and patent term restoration was reported out of the house judiciary subcommittee and the full committee in contrast to the opposition in the th congress ptr moved through the subcommittee and the full committee without a single member speaking in opposition to the measure in early october  the house passed ptr and again no one spoke in opposition to ptr in addition the fifra package was amended to ptr the house passed fifra and ptr again in a different form and sent it back to the senate where it eventually died it is expected that ptr legislation will be introduced early in the th congress based on information from house judiciary subcommittee staff it is likely that the subcommittee will move expeditiously to report out ptr legislation in the senate with the retirement of senator mathias rmd it is not yet certain who will be the lead person on this issue cma will continue to work with the industry coalition and play a supportive role to the national agricultural chemicals associations efforts on this issue the prospects for passage of ptr in  will hinge on the satisfactory resolution of conflicts among the industry consumerenvironmental groups and the generic producers on amendments to fifra process patent legislation this legislation would have expanded the definition of patent infringement to cover importation into the united states and use and sale in this country of products made abroad by processes patented in the us two versions of this legislation passed the house and one version passed the senate during the final days of the th congress negotiations continued until the day congress adjourned without final approval the industry coalition which had been involved in negotiating the compromise legislation in the last congress will be active on this issue in the th congress the group is looking to senator frank r lautenberg dnj to revive this issue hopefully early in the new session cma will continue to support prompt passage of process patent protection legislation the current evasion of our patent law  cma  is costly not only in actual revenue lost but also to the number of us jobs that are actually lost to foreign manufacturers liability reform and insurance  congressional developments and response the product liability reform legislation was passed out of the senate commerce committee and considered on the senate floor in the th congress it did not pass the senate nor was it considered in the house the th congress has the democrats in control of the house and the senate which will change the agenda for the product liability issue senator ernest hollings dsc will now be the chairman of the commerce connittee hollings has long been a strong opponent of far reaching federal product liability legislation thus we will have to wait and see what his agenda will be for the coasserce committee on the house side the ad hoc bipartisan product liability study group is looking at the issue and may make legislative recommendations state legislative and regulatory advocacy  liability reform insurance and public compensation approximately  states passed some tort reform legislation in  many of these laws dealt with single areas such as daycare centers or municipal liability only a few states such as colorado connecticut washington and florida passed comprehensive reform bills the issues that saw the most activity in  were  modification or elimination of joint and several liability  caps on noneconomic damages  collateral source rules to deal with the problem of double payments in most cases the chemical industry has shared in the benefits of general tort reform however injuries involving hazardous substances were partially or in some cases completely excluded from some of the significant reforms particularly the limitation on joint and several liability the american legislative exchange council a national organization of approximately  conservative state legislators adopted proposed legislative language on tort reform issues for inclusion in the recently published source book of american state legislation  cmas tort reform issues resource book was utilized in the development of this language the continued concern over insurance availability is likely to generate significant activity in   cma   hazardous vasts management and regulation at the december meeting of the council of state governments csg subcommittee on suggested state legislation the new jersey environmental cleanup responsibility act ecra was again considered as a possible model for other states this law seriously limits the transfer of property until site contamination studies and cleanup have been completed cmas state affairs special ecra work group is managing this issue in conjunction with the new jersey cic the cic has been working directly with state officials to amend the law as a result primarily of the cics work csg subcommittee voted in december to defer consideration until the state of new jersey verifies the needed changes these changes will reportedly occur in the first half of  and probably in time for the final vote by csg on model legislation during their summer meeting some form of an ecra law will more than likely be considered at that meeting  righttoknow the decision in the lawsuit brought by pennsylvania manufacturers regarding the application of the states righttoknow law has been appealed to the united states supreme court under a lower court decision issued at the end of  chemical manufacturers could be required to prepare separate labels and msdss for their products shipped into or used in pennsylvania the industrys appeal to the supreme court seeks to uphold and clarify the preemption of the osha hazard communication standard over state righttoknow lsw an injunction against the implementation of the state law as it applies to manufacturers is in effect until the court decides whether or not it will accept the case  chemical plant safety a top priority for the new chemical safety task group is to address state legislation that would regulate chemical plant processes several states considered laws in  and new jersey enacted a comprehensive statute which requires risk assessments and risk management plans for certain facilities an issues analysis document has been developed by a combined state affairsemc work group and will be distributed to member company state affairs contacts and state cics in january the new task group is also working with the caer task group to promote the caer program as a method for states to implement the emergency response requirements of title iii of the new superfund law  groundwater the california initiative on safe drinking water and toxics enforcement act of  passed by the voters in november by a margin of  to  or roughly  to  early in the summer the odds were as high as  to  in favor of the proposition so the public relations  cma  program developed and implemented by the industry coalition had a significant impact on the publics perception of this issue however it obviously was not enough to change the outcome there are some who believe that if the pr program had been started sooner ie funding obtained earlier our chances for success would have been greater proposition  is now in the hands of the administration and the legislature the first major implementation date is march   when the governor must publish a list of effected chemicals a year later on march   the warning provisions go into effect and on november   the discharge prohibitions become effective the industry coalition will continue to work with the administration to implement the law with as little damage to the californias economy as possible hopefully it will be able to work with the legislature to cleanup some of the provisions in the initiative a thorough legal evaluation resulted in the decision not to litigate at this time while there were some potential constitutional grounds for challenging the new law it was the consensus of the coalitions steering committee and legal counsel that better opportunities for litigation would occur during the implementation of the law meanwhile many environmental groups are seeking to take the lead in implementing proposition  there are even classified ads in the california newspapers recruiting bounty hunters in fact the bounty hunter provision may be used as a membership enticement for environmental groups the cma state affairs committee has appointed a special ad hoc group to develop the chemical industrys recommended advocacy approach to this issue not only in california but to the other states where it may spread  toxic air the state affairs air toxics task group is working with the state

drug administration requesting the commissioner of food and drugs to issue a regulation recognizing a prior sanction for the use of bht as a direct and indirect food additive the major purpose of the petition is to work with the agency in developing a process by which the fda evaluates the safety of bht in light of all experimental studies another purpose is to request fda to establish a common regulatory status for all foodrelated uses of bht the use of bht as an antioxidant in food currently is subject to a complex regulatory scheme chlorobenzenes a joint petition filed by the chlorobenzenes program panel and the socma chlorobenzenes producers association us producers of ortho and paradichlorobenzene requested that epa withdraw the requirement for reproductive and fertility effects testing mandated in a tsca section a test rule the petition reflects epa and industry consensus on the significance of available data on the potential for dichlorobenzenes to cause reproductive effects scientific consensus was reached prior to issuance of the test rule in essence there was agreement that a negative reproductive effects study on monochlorobenzene combined with existing negative data on trichlorobenzene would eliminate concern for potential reproductive effects of the dichlorobenzenes the petition was accompanied by a panelsponsored reproductive effects  cma  study on monochlorobenzene that failed to demonstrate significant adverse reproductive effects producers of trichlorobenzene are preparing to initiate oncogenicity studies in rats and mice the testing is required by cpa under a tsca section a test rule preliminary palatibility and subchronic studies will be conducted in both species in order to set dose levels in the twoyear bioassays the panel has requested that cpa reconsider the need for soil adsorption studies on dichlorobenzenes and trichlorobenzene a recent report of a study containing data of the type required in the test rule was submitted to epa with the request the study was conducted for the epa ots health and environmental review division under an interagency agreement with the department of energy cresols the panel has made final laboratory selections for research that will be conducted under a tsca section a final test rule hazleton laboratories inc will conduct mutagenicity studies and bushy run research

ethvlhexanolc acid cma filed a petition for judicial review of epas finding that eha may present an unreasonable risk within the context of tscas testing provisions the panel will argue that epas testing requirements are not supported by substantial evidence cma is also seeking a stay of the epa testing requirements pending completion of judicial review proceedings ethvlhexanol the producers importers and users of eh formed a new panel to interact with epa in the development of a test rule test rule activity was initiated by epa in august  a proposed rule to initiate a bioassay was planned for publication by january  with a final rule by june  once the biosay was underway epa planned to propose a second test rule to cover any other testing that might be needed eh originally the subject of an ntpsponsored chronic bioassay came to epas attention when budget cuts forced ntp to drop the bioassay from its program as a result the agency decided to use the tsca section  provisions to require industry to conduct the test the panel entered into negotiations with epa to attempt a test program under the newly developed consent agreement procedure rather than formal rulemaking although epa and ntp agreed with the panels concept of a collaborative research program negotiations broke down over disagreements on the chemicals  cma  to be tested the route of administration and the importance of understanding the mechanism of carcinogenicity a proposed rule was published in the federal register on december   glycol ethers the glycol ethers panel will sponsor mutagenicity tests on diethylene glycol monobutyl ether dgbe at dows lake jackson research center dgbe will be evaluated in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and in an in vitro mutation assay chohgprt these tests have been proposed by epa in a tsca section a test rule plans to initiate a voluntary testing program on the triethylene glycol ethers have been postponed epa informed the panel that due to a more severe economic impact of the proposed test rule than originally anticipated the agency is reconsidering testing needs for these glycol ethers furthermore epa is developing a generic glycol ethers test rule and it is possible that the triethylene glycol ethers will be included the generic rule is scheduled to issue this summer a panel meeting with epa is anticipated in february in a federal register notice published on december   osha responded to epas tsca section a referral of methoxyethanol ethoxyethanol and their acetates osha preliminarily concluded that occupational exposures at the current permissible exposure limits may present a significant health risk and that adoption of a revised occupational standard is economically and technologically feasible osha did not indicate when it plans to initiate rulemaking hvdroquinone panel representatives met with epa on december  to discuss the interim rule on extremely hazardous substances and threshold planning quantity under superfund amendments cma recommended that hydroquinone be deleted from the listing of acutely toxic chemicals because the relevant animal effects data do not satisfy the proposed listing criteria isopropanol in response to the th interagency testing committee report designating isopropanol for health effects studies under section a of tsca producers met with cma and have decided to form a special program panel the panels initial activity will center on the development of a testing program to respond to itcs concerns and to work with the epa on a negotiated testing consent agreement ketones mesityl oxide producers took steps to include supplemental material in the administrative record before the fifth circuit court in december the motion to supplement was denied this means that judicial review of the epa mesityl oxide test rule will proceed on the prepetition record in the fifth circuit and will not include information supportive of the producers tsca section  petition for withdrawal of the rule the opening brief will be filed in january an epa move to stay us district court proceedings challenging epas denial of the section  petition was granted having received a final denial of supplementation in the fifth circuit the mesityl oxide producers are seeking to vacate the stay the natural resources defense council nrdc moved to intervene in the fifth circuit and the petition was granted the american petroleum institute will file an amicus curiae brief lubricant additives hazard profiles developed by the group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine pollution gesamp were used as the basis for categorization of classes of lubricant additives the bulk chemical handling bch subcommittee of imo placed most of the additives in a provisional category b zinc dithiophosphates were placed in category a concerns with the protocol design of aquatic toxicity studies conducted by the panel appear to be the basis of the provisional classifications the zinc classification resulted from concern with bioccumulation the panel is awaiting clarification from gesamp before proceeding to address these issues the panel has provided tank stripping data to the us coast guard that demonstrates efficient stripping of vessels carrying viscous additives these data will be presented to the bch subcommittee via cefic as evidence supporting exemption to the viscosity limitations in international regulations governing marine transport of bulk chemicals marpol  the panel has also made arrangements for the us coast guard to observe a stripping test on an emptied vessel in port phosgene the panel recently decided not to perform a large field test of phosgene release at the nevada nuclear test site this year the panel will continue investigating the feasibility of performing this study at a future date and possibly at a different location comments are being prepared on the august  epa health assessment document on phosgene comments are due to epa by january   phthalate esters the panel has begun discussions with epas test rules development branch which may lead to a consent agreement to complete environmental testing under tsca section  the panel has already completed an extensive battery of acute tests and a chronic study on each of  phthalate esters under a negotiated testing agreement accepted by epa in january  the second phase of testing which was originally agreed to by the agency in its  federal register notice was rejected by epa in  following the court ease decision invalidating ntas the panel is hopeful that its original proposal will now be accepted and that environmental effects testing will be completed under a consent order rubber additives the panel submitted final reports to epa on the results of two comparative pharmacokinetics studies on mercaptobenzothiazole and its disulfide derivative the studies confirmed that both compounds are handled similarly and are rapidly  cma  taken up

grassroots activities during  the grassroots program has undergone a transition in its focus upon completion of the grassroots effort in support of the superfund reauthorixation the program has been expanding its base among cma member companies and identifying several new issue areas for involvement during  the objective is to evolve the program into a multiissue permanent contact mechanism to advance cmas federal legislative advocacy efforts in environment worker health and safety and economictrade issues the priority issue for the grassroots program during  will be air toxics emissions already much activity has begun toward developing a grassroots network on air toxics eightynine members of the house and senate have been targeted as key legislators in congressional activity on air toxics earlier this year member company grassroots managers assigned congressional liaison representatives clrs to lead the grassroots effort in their congressional districts clrs have been involved in program and issue orientation in establishing relationships with assigned legislators and in the development of coalitions within their districts these coalitions comprised of chemical company representatives and other interested constituents have been meeting and will continue to meet in early  to discuss the air toxics message and strategies for communicating with key legislators meetings between clrs coalitions and key legislators will be scheduled for februarymarch  during the preliminary stages of debate on air toxics emissions other program activities are underway and will continue in  to develop an adaptability to changes in issue emphasis in addition  cma  to air coxics two other issues are emerging for grassroots consideration worker notification and groundwater an analysis of key legislators in these issue areas is ongoing to determine clr assignments education of grassroots managers and clrs and message development for worker notification and groundwater will begin in early  in anticipation of legislative activity in the th congress efforts will also continue to incorporate member companies into the program either through existing coalitions or through the building of new clrkey legislator relationships  federal candidate information activities the candidate information task groups activities for  were geared toward the november elections the task group provided opportunities for companies to meet nonincumbent candidates to the house and senate through a series of get acquainted sessions other activities of the task group included analysis of cma member company employee pac contributions to the key members of the house and senate identification of key races and candidates and the mailing of an issues  packet to all candidates to the th congress which include economic and issues related information although  is a nonelection year for federal offices the candidate information task group has a tentative agenda which includes o followup with freshmen congressmen who participated in cmas get acquainted sessions during  and other key members as appropriate o identification of and increased chemical industry visibility with  senate and house candidates o final analysis of cma member company employee pac contributions during the  elections o continued analysis of cma member company employee pacs in  activities to support this agenda will include get acquainted sessions with senate candidates and preparations of an issues  publication the candidate information task group also plans to identify member company washington representatives who are close to candidates seeking their partys presidential nomination to facilitate communications of cma positions on national issues of interest to the chemical industry the candidate information task group will continue with an aggressive and innovative approach to improving the chemical industry involvement in and visibility with candidates the upcoming  elections promise to be hotly contested and will soon dominate the agenda of congress and both national parties fthe candidate  cma  information task group will continua to provide an opportunity for the chemical industry to usa the elections to advance our capabilities technical department superfund activity has now shifted from the legislative to the regulatory arena and many of the cercla amendments must be carefully managed to avoid unreasonable regulations cma has analyzed both cercla amendments and title iii and has prepared a draft cma action plan the draft is now in the hands of key cma committee representatives who with their committees and task groups will develop specific and refined plans of action for managing important cma initiatives for these sweeping pieces of legislation major legislative efforts in air water hazardous materials transportation worker notification of significant exposure and possibly tsca reauthorization are key legislative issues for this year regulatory

occurred the first involved a shipment of bacterial cultures originating in brussels belgium san francisco airport fire department personnel isolated the leaking  cma  container while chemtrec alerted the canters for disease control in atlanta and contacted the belgium shipper for identification of the cultures product information was obtained and the cultures were destroyed by autoclaving without further incident later that evening dow chemical melbourne australia reported a problem with a drum of magnesium that had been contaminated chemtrec was able to teleconference the caller with knowledgeable people at dow chemical midland michigan who provided decontamination and disposal information cma  cma  report of tax policy committee executive summary overview in  the tax policy committee was very deeply involved in key legislative issues affecting the chemical industry responding to the numerous problems raised in both tax reform and superfund reauthorization legislation the coomiittee responsibly handled a vide range of tax issues that could increase industry tax costs by more than  billion annually tax reform legislation for over two years the tax policy committee has dealt with the basic issues of tax reform legislation in  president reagan proposed a year shift of over  billion in individual tax burdens to business taxpayers vithin the business sector the presidents tax program would finance lower corporate and individual tax rates by repealing the investment tax credit and reducing depreciation allowances in addition there would be significant changes in the tax treatment of international business activities that would substantially increase the tax costs of us corporations in december  the house of representatives passed hr  a bill whose basic tax reform philosophy was in agreement with that advocated by the president cmas major tax activity in  was before the senate committee on finance in addition to the issues identified in the house bill cma successfully lobbied the finance committee to reject several tax proposals that would have had a disproportionate impact on the chemical industry cma also successfully lobbied the finance committa to include favorable amendments on the issues identified in the house bill chemical industry losses will be offset in part by more favorable depreciation treatment and lower corporate tax rates during the housesenate conference cma supported the senate bill however cma successfully lobbied the conferees to reduce the penalty on depreciation in the alternative minimum tax the overall impact of the tax bill will increase taxes paid by the chemicl industry over the next  years that increase however is not as great as the increase other capital intensive industries sustained in this legislation superfund lexislation the tax policy committee continued to provide technical assistance in  to the government relations committee on superfund funding issues including broad base tax proposals this assistance provided a major contribution to the effectiveness of cmas superfund legislative advocacy cma exhibit k liability reform in thestates objective to achieve positive reforms of tort law through state legislation and to protect the chemical industry from being singled out for discriminatory or punitive treatment in such legislation background and status executive committee request at its november meeting the executive committee requested that a report on state tort reform be prepared to address model state legislation and coalitions end to provide a status report on  state legislative activity  legislative activity approximately  states passed some reform legislation in  many of these lews dealt only with areas such as daycare centers or municipal liability only a states such as colorado connecticut vashington and florida comprehensive reform bills the issues that have seen the most in  were tort single few passed activity  modification or elimination of joint and several liability  caps on noneconomic damages  collateral source rules to deal with the problem of double payments in most eases the chemical industry has shared in the benefits of general tort reform however injuries involving hazardous substances were partially or in some cases completely excluded from some of the significant reforms particularly the limitation on joint and several liability cma activities cma has undertaken the following activities to seek positive reforms in state tort law o developed and distributed an issues book that sets forth and discusses  priority tort law reforms for adoption in the states these issues were divided into three tiers based on their relative impact on the chemical industry home companies however may have different priorities based on factors unique to these companies the first tier included five issues relative to reforms which cma recommended es the basic elements in any meaningful bill  noneconomic damages should be capped  damages should be reduced by the amount of collateral source payments  joint and several liability should be eliminated  awards of punitive damages should he carefully scrutinized and controlled by the court  fault should be required for liability cma  the second tier of priority issues included limit contingency fees require qualified expert testimony eliminate liability without causation provide that initial warnings are adequate the third tier of priority issues included  eliminate nonmutual collateral estoppel  bar evidence of subsequent remedial measures  eliminate liability for conduct in compliance with government standards  eliminate recovery for commercial loss o using the priority issues book as a guide cma has actively participated in the preparation of model legislation by the american legislative exchange council alec is a national organization of approximately  conservative state legislators proposed legislative language was adopted for inclusion in alecs source book of american state legislation  cmas tort reformissues resource book was utilized in the development of this language and cma objectives as set forth in the issues book were incorporated the alec source book was sent to all  state legislators in december o during the same time period cma worked with the american tort reform association atra is a broad based coalition created for the specific purpose of supporting tort reform cma served on atras legal conaittee which prepared policy papers on various tort reform issues the final policy papers a major supporting document for alecs model bills and a copy of alecs model legislation were published in september in the atra legislative resource book this manual has been delivered to all ur congressmen state governors and legislators state tort reform coalitions and all atra members o successful tort reform has frequently involved the use of broad based coalitions including major industries small businesses doctors and local governments o the texas chemical council has been very active in tort reform coalition efforts and could be used as a guide by other chemical councils o cma has selected priority states and contacts are being developed with those states in addition these contacts are being expanded by working in cooperation with the council of chemical association executives cma  o cma continues to monitor and support tort reform in all states the text of the alec model bills and the status of  tort reform initiatives with a state by state outlook for  is available from cma recommendations o cma and its member companies should support existing alec model legislation rather than drafting a separate chemical industry model bill these proposals have been developed by a broad based coalition which included cma and agreement has been reached as to the provisions which largely coincide with the chemical industrys priorities drafting additional proposals at this time could create a wedge dividing proponents of tort reform moreover a model bill created by the chemical industry is unlikely to receive the broad support available through the alec bills o cma should encourage member companies through state chemical councils and other state business organizations to actively participate in efforts to support general tort reform on a state by state basis cma should also urge state chemical industry councils to include tort reform as a top priority issue for  and to participate in or initiate broad based state coalitions such as the texas model to achieve tort reform action required approval of recommendations cma cma  exhibit l communications committee  report to cma board of directors michael e thompson since this report is  by definition  an annual report theres a natural temptation to which im going to yield to look back at the events of the past year and ask the familiar question are we better off than we were  months ago when i put that question to the members of the communications committee the response was a strong conviction that the chemical industry today is in better standing with the public and the press than it was last year this improvement is real and even verifiable as ill point out in a minute in short it feels good and it is good or at least getting better in our report to you last year the committee felt that the industry was ready to make a move in improving its reputation what the industry needed was continued commitment from senior management a year without a major domestic incident a major communications effort from the industrys plant people and communications professionals and frankly a bit of luck well we got a lot of what we needed in  starting at the top senior managers in the industry gave their personal and corporate endorsement to our communications efforts particularly on superfund caer and air toxics word has spread throughout your organizations that it is good business to commit time and manpower to communicating on these important issues we also had a year without a major chemical incident to rekindle the fears of bhopal the closest we came was the train derailment near mlamisburg ohio fortunately there was no loss of life or serious injury and the operating and communications people involved in the incident did their jobs well as a result the accident was portrayed in the media as being as much a rail mishap as a chemicalrelated problem perhaps the worst reporting on the mlamisburg incident may have occurred on the abc network coverage of the golf tournament that was being played in nearby dayton at the time of the wreck i can remember cringing in front of ay tv set watching and listening to those two noted environmental reporters  dave harr and jim mckay  discussing how to play golf in sulfur fumes directorcorporate media relations amoco corporation cma  f we also seemed to have escaped much residual blame for the recent rhine river spill in switzerland frankly im at a loss as to why that incident didnt receive more critical coverage in the us but im sure not complaining about it each day without a pageone incident puts bhopal one more day behind us  also saw a remarkable communications effort in the industrys support of the caer program at the local level if we had the time i could have filled both days of this meeting with success stories on the communication of the caer program in our plant communities in fact  could be called the year of the chemical plant open house the chemical industry held more open houses than century  last year and the overwhelmingly positive results reflect the considerable effort that went into these activities i cant recall a single negative episode in the thousands of caerrelated communications activities that took place in  these local activities have further enhanced the role of the chemical plant manager as a communicator in his local community these individuals today are more willing and capable of representing your companies and our industry than ever before its also clear to the committee that many companies are now placing increased value on communications skills when senior management selects the people to serve as your plant managers on the media relations front in  the committee felt that we generally received fair coverage our relationships with environmental reporters for many major media were further strengthened during the year familiarity breeds respect in this  regard and we had another year to increase our industrys credibility with these reporters in addition all of our skins got a little bit thicker in  as the industry learned anew that working with the media is a tough nononsense and sometime frustrating part of all of our jobs as a result our collective tolerance level with the media is even higher than it was we have learned that no one story or single episode is critical and that its the long term results that count in working with the press as a result of these and other efforts in  the publics opinion of our industry improved at least if you believe the public opinion surveys i wont go into all the statistics but i think a few trends are worth comment according to one prestigious national survey the publics view of our industry improved measurably our approval rating in this survey increased by about  percent during  however fairness requires me to point out that we started the year dead last among  industries with a rating so low that any improvement would seem large by comparison this improvement though slight moved us from th place to about th or th on cma  the industry list were above the alcohol and nuclear power industries and very close to the electric utility industry now our standing doesnt begin to compare with the ratings of the toprated computer industry or the food and retailing industries but we moved up a notch or two and our ranking is the highest its been since  that has to qualify as good news this survey showed two other items of special interest first in a special questionnaire the plastics industry received an approval rating that would place it at about th place on the industry list since many of the companies here today have some interest in plastics this approval rating should be encouraging and secondly the oil industry which for years had been in the publics doghouse improved noticeably in  the oil guys were in last place by the fourth quarter of  oil had moved all the way up to about the middle of the  industries so major improvement is possible if we persevere other results from other surveys show mixed results  either the publics opinion about us stayed the same or improved only slightly we seem to be rebounding slowly from last years rockbottom ratings yet we should not confuse these slight improvements with any lessening of the publics concern about the environment and our industry survey after survey continue to show that the american people place environmental concerns very high among their priorities even to the point of preferring the environment over jobs or higher prices when faced with a choice in the surveys the public feels that the environment is improving but feels that the improvement has been progressing too slowly and that nobody  business or government  is acting quickly enough the public continues to rank the disposal of hazardous wastes as its number one environmental concern and cites the chemical industry consistently as the countrys primary source of air and water pollution faced with these conditions the communications committees  objectives reflect our enthusiasm to support chas advocacy efforts and the opportunity to parlay these efforts where possible into improved communications with the public at large heading our project list for  is the followup on our caer communication achievements of  if there is a cma member plant that hasnt yet conducted a caer communications activity we want to find it and get it on track with the rest of the industry cma  caer has been the leadership effort for the chemical industry during this decade and we must not let it wither  either in an operating or a communications sense the committees greatest fear is that our plant people will become complacent about caer now that they have gone through all the effort of establishing it in their communities pardon the pun but caer will require a lot of tender loving care in the future if it is to continue as the industrys flagship health and safety program another of the many values of caer is that it gives us the opportunity to deal from strength in conducting our future communications activities at the plant level with this in mind the committee and cma staff are building on caers success in tackling the industrys two upcoming communications hurdles  air toxics and the implementation of the title iii provisions of superfund in the air toxics area a survey of the committee found that most of the companies intend to treat their air toxics communications as an extension of the caer program however we should realize that the air toxics issue presents some communications barriers that are quite different from our caer effort for one thing chemical plants in a community usually produce widely differing product slates so while one plant can boast to the local media about its relatively clean products and lack of toxic air emissions a neighboring plant manager may have a devil of a time explaining why he cant comment about chronic air emissions of his highlytoxlc products remember too that most of these same plants worked closely together in introducing the  caer program to the community the unified local approach that worked so well with the caer program also could suffer when different plants are at different stages of implementing their air toxics programs another concern is that many plant managers understandably are reluctant to be as aggressive in promoting the air toxics issue as they were with caer the reason is clear admitting to chronic air emissions of toxic chemicals is not a pleasant duty and in some cases managers are not in a position to comment about the longterm effects of exposure to these emissions in overcoming these concerns the communications committee cma staff and your local managers will carry out a comprehensive and effective communications program weve already held our first air toxics communications workshop  earlier this month in houston it was well attended including many plant managers and many important questions were raised we do plan to be a bit cautious in our approach to this communications program and i hope you agree with our thinking cma  w also plan to build on the caer communications success in helping local plant people cope with the title iii provision of superfund these provisions will require your plants to make more information available about your products and processes than ever before it will all be available at once and it will be available to anyone who wants it already some environmental groups have shown what they can do to embarrass us with our own information taken out of context the committee has formed a separate task group that will help us formulate our communications policy in this area our final major objective in  is to continue to assist the state chemical councils in improving their communications capabilities weve already have made important progress in illinois louisiana and new jersey and well be working with more states in the future this statelevel activity becomes more important when you realize that propositiontype legislation will expand from california to many other states the cics so far have been receptive to our help and we plan to continue this partnership so our  agenda will consist of four major objectives following up on caer communications extending our communications activities to cover the air toxics and title iii issues and working with the cics these objectives are in addition of course to our ongoing work with other committees within cma to provide communications counsel and handson help as required the committee feels that these goals are achievable with current manpower and with current resources i would like to close with a comment that doesnt fall readily into our normal communications topics the committee feels that we should be wary of the recent attacks on the socalled corpocracy of major us companies while its too early to call this a major trend there are a lot of people cut there including some in the current administration who may well be taking shots at us businessmen executives could be blamed for everything from working too hard on their golf game to operating bloated and inefficient organizations to sacrificing the bluecollar workers future for the sake of their friends in the executive suite along these lines gm may be the first company to enter this quagmire that companys soso performance the perot buyout the wave of midwest plant closings and a weak product slate have combined to focus public and media attention on the personal capabilities of those managing the giant auto company cma  while gm may be the first we shouldnt be fooled into thinking the publics attention will stop there this is a trend well all have to watch very closely in conclusion  saw the chemical industrys reputation with the public improve for the first time in several years this uptick did not come about by accident it occurred because we operated safely moved aggressively to meet the publics legitimate concerns about our operations and took the time to tell people what we were doing through caer and other programs we showed a lot of confidence in the american public last year maybe theyre beginning to return that confidence i hope so we look forward to earning your continued support throughout  i will be pleased to try to answer any questions you might have about the communications committee and our  plans cma cma  exhibit m annum report or the patent and trademark committee january   executive summary in  cma through the patent and trademark committee patc or the committee has been an instrumental voice in providing industry input to the us administration and congress in the development of patent policies at home and abroad the patc has also advocated cma positions directly with foreign authorities as appropriate and with other domestic and foreign industry groups during the past year cma through the patc has obtained increased visibility and respect in the industrial property rights area congressional and agency staffs solicit cmas comments on pending domestic legislation aniticipated regulatory changes and international negotiations in the legislative arenathe committee continued its efforts on patent term restoration legislation for chemicals moreover the committee advocated enactment of process patent legislation and reviewed appropriate cma positions on federal laboratory utilization legislation government patent policy and amendments to section  of the tariff act of  as amended in addition to advocacy efforts on legislation the committee prepared written comments for submission by cma on a number of regulatory and international issues the comnittee also participated in a number of the administrations investigations and informationgathering activities on the international protection of industrial property rights and advised the cma international trade committee on the appropriate role of this subject in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations in all these forums the committee has stressed the importance of strengthened patent protection to us technological advancement continued economic recovery and productivity the patc also played an important communications role in  in keeping cmas member companies apprised of developments on industrial property rights issues the committee communicated with the board of directors and member companies on a number of patent issues through mechanisms such as action advisories other cma reports and newsletters by playing this coimnunications role the committee not only disseminated information to member companies but also became informed on the positions of the members on patent issues the committee in turn was then better able to formulate proposed cma positions and advocate existing ones finally it is significant to note that the conmittee has carried out these  activities with no expenditures for outside assistance either technical or legal written comnents were prepared and advocacy activities carried out by committee members other designated cma member company representatives and cma staff we also do not anticipate any major outside assistance expenses during  cma cma  exhibit n waste minimization program purpose of executive committee and board of directors review the environmental management conmittees emc ad hoc task group on waste minimization presented a status report describing the vaste minimization issues importance and a possible cma program at the november board of directors meeting the purpose of this review is to obtain approval of a recommended cma program background the  amendments to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra require companies to establish voluntary waste minimization programs and certify actions several states have in place or are developing legislation requiring vaste minimization company waste minimization efforts are also being scrutinized when permits for waste facilities are requested alternatives for stronger federal action are discussed in recent reports to congress by the office of technology assessment and epa applying greater pressure to force waste minimization appears to be a high priority for public interest groups this goal is reflected in various thrusts toward achieving zero discharge and opposition to siting new treatment and disposal facilities the progress that industry has made in implementing voluntary waste minimization programs will be evaluated by congress in hearings beginning in  if industry cannot demonstrate sufficient progresst public interest groups may be able to convince congress to adopt extreme amendments as part of rcras reauthorization which is scheduled in  the amendments could include such undesirable intrusions into industry operations as limits on waste generation process restrictions and outside audits companies are already confronted with increasing costs of vaste disposal as epa expands the scope of wastes regulated as hazardous under rcra implements further land disposal pretreatment requirements and further tightens controls over waste management practices many companies have significantly reduced their waste at this time however there is no reliable national data to demonstrate industrywide progress and fpas programs are under attack iii timing waste minimization is likely to be an issue in rcra hearings and reauthorization in addition epa is committed to improve waste minimization programs and data bases in  which it must do to reduce congressional oversight pressures cma needs to start its program early in  to provide assistance to epa and to develop an industry position that frames the debete in terms that are reasonable although

program ob  active  inform and assise member companies in reducing wastes at the source increasing recycle and reducing disposal risks expected benefits of this effort are o better protection of human health and the environment o avoiding onerous legislation that mandates waste reduction o limiting disposal costs and future cleanup liability and o improving public understanding of industry generation and disposal practices proposed cma position on waste minimization cma supports efforts of its member companies to minimize waste cma member companies have programs in place that have resulted in reduced air water and solid waste releases to the environment to achieve further progress individual companies are encouraged to expand their programs to respond to additional waste minimization opportunities that exist in their operations cma will inform and assist its member companies in reducing wastes by implementing a waste minimization program activities o an industry program to promote and assist member companies in developing and carrying out waste minimization programs ie workshops resource manuals newsletter and swards program o legislative and regulatory advocacy support to address waste minimization issues before congress and epa o measurement of waste minimization progress in order to document progress ie uniform definitions of key terms definition of measurement needs evaluation of existing data systems and modification thereof o communications of member company and industry waste minimization activities ie identification of key perceptions development of a strategy to effectively communicate industrywide and anecdotal information to targeted audiences on a continuing basis further cma programmatic action ie establishing percentage

federal assistance should be available to help the state perform these tasks failure by the state to develop a program would only lead to a loss of any further federal assistance for program implementation a state program should have to address the following components a program to characterize state groundwater resources to the extent necessary for state planning use of appropriate groundwater objectives and standards a prograa to protect state groundwater resources from sources of contamination a process to address groundwater remediation needs a groundwater monitoring program a process to address interstate groundwater impacts the following are detailed descriptions of each of these components groundwater characterization the state oust establish a program to characterize its groundwater resources to the extent necessary for the state planning the program should rely on existing data where that is available and feasible the state should consult with the united states geological survey usgs and the united states environmental protection agency epa for guidance on developing the characterization program the state could decide not to characterize particular portions of the groundwater resource if it determines chat such action is not necessary at that time based upon its characterization program the state could divide its groundwater into various categories which may require different management approaches groundwater objectives and standards the stata must establish appropriate groundwater objectives objectives apply to individual aquifers or portions of aquifers the objectives oust identify the current and reasonably anticipated future uses of the groundwater based upon the objectives the state must identify standards that will protect availability of the groundwater for those identified uses standards must be set using scientificallyvalid bases for regulating drinking water supply the state must use maximum contaminant levels mcls adopted by epa under the safe drinking water act whenever a substance has an mcl the state should use criteria developed by epa to sac numarleal usa standards this would require e new work effort criteria development at epa protection programs the state must davalop resources from sources groundwater protection the goal of minimizing a program to protect its groundwater of contamination tn developing the program the state should consider releases to groundwater in developing its protection program the state must identify and evaluate existing and potential sources of contamination the program could include as appropriate source controls land use controls groundwater withdrawal limitations and any other suitable protection measures the program must be coordinated with existing source control programs including those under rcra sdwa ftfra and cva and must be consistent with existing federal provisions concerning adequate hazardous waste treatment or disposal capacity the program must address all significant sources of contamination source controls could apply uniformly statewide or could apply to specific types of sources or individual sources source control requirements should make appropriate distinctions among new and old sources different types of sources and specific unique sources protection measures must take into account applicable groundwater objectives and standards some minimum protection measures should be developed for all areas of the state cma  the stats must determine how its program will be ijnplanantad eg voluntary controls regulations training aducation and any other appropriate measures tha program must include adequate authority for the state to enforce protection requirements groundwater remediation the state must develop a process to address groundwater remediation needs when needed remedial measures should be formulated on a case specific basis and take into account any appropriate groundwater objectivesstandards the state remediation process must be coordinated with applicable state and federal laws including state tort and watar rights law the state must address all sources for which there may he significant remedial concerns the remediation process must include adequate authority for the state to enforce remedial requirements monitoring programs the state must develop a groundwater monitoring program the program must be formulated to serve three purposes a assess the extent to which groundwater meers applicable groundwater objectives and standards b provide information on groundwater trends and contaminants c provide information on sources of contamination as necessary the program must include measures to ensure that data gathered are scientifically valid the state should consult with the united states geological survey and epa for guidance on developing the monitoring program the state could establish a data management system that incorporates all relevant monitoring data the data management system should include information so the user can identify the quality control and quality assurance of the data before those data are used cma  i interstate impacts the seat program should include a mechanism to assess interstate impacts and to develop interstate agreements where appropriate cma  concepts for federal groundwater legislation federal role in groundwater management federal funding would be available to assist the states in developing their programs if a state submits a groundwater management program to epa that includes all of the required components epa must accept the program and provide funding to assist in implementation epa may not judge the substantive adequacy of the state program as long as the state program includes all of the required componenta and the state certifies that their program complies with the statutory requirements epa and usgs must assist the states by developing and providing groundwater quality criteria technical information and guidance on

products which threaten national security a list of such products is maintained by the general services administration additions to the list are handled by the department of commerce through a petition process a ruling on the petition must occur within one year of its filing if favorable the ruling must then be acted upon by the president but no deadlines currently exist for presidential actions the products currently included on the list which could be considered to be chemicals are either ores or chemical element products nevertheless there is good reason to believe chat as petrochemical industries continue to develop in researchrich areas of the world causing us plant closures additional chemical products such as petrochemicals would be added to the list a major omnibus trade bill is anticipated from the th congress the cma international trade committee has already proposed a number of positions to the board which address different facets of existing trade law which cma will be able to address either directly or through coalitions during the upcoming congressional deliberations cma position cma supports the strengthening of section  of the trade expansion act of  and recommends the following chenges to achieve this aim o shorten the time period allotted for the secretary of commerce to act on section  petitions o shorten the time for existing mandatory deadlines or impose deadlines where none exist by which both the secretary of commerce and the president must act on section  investigations o require public disclosure of final actions on petitions action requested approval of attached position cma cma  trade law remedies concerning imports threatening national security current lav section  of the trade expansion act of  authorizes the president to restrict imports of products which threaten national security the lav requires the secretary of commerce to begin an investigation of the potential national security impact of imports of a produet upon the request of another government agency or department an interested party or his own volition if the secretary determines that there is some threat to national security he must advise the president within one year of the initiation of the investigation however the president is not obliged to answer this petition within a specific period sampling of proposals made for legislative changes several proposals have been made to establish deadlines for presidential action such as a requirement that the president act within one year after receiving the secretarys advice another suggestion would establish a day deadline some would im plement the secretarys recommendations if the president has not acted within  days after receiving the report another sug gestion would transfer the authority from the presidentto the ustr and would require the ustr to act within the  days after receiving the secretarys recommendations  cma positiom certain products including some chemicals are essential to the united states in times of national emergency the federal government should ensure that import competition does not hinder the capacity of domestic industries to guarantee adequate sup plies of these essential products legislation that would provide for deadlines will force the administration to focus on questions of national security and imports in a timely manner however transferring current presidential authority to the ustr seems ineffective since the ustr is part of the administration and as a practical matter would not act without the presidents authority certain chemical feedstocks as well as derivative products could fall into the category of being essential to national security the issue as to what extent the national security and foreign policy concerns outweigh the economic benefits of short term lover prices and the question of what national security costs should be borne by the taxpayers to protectagainst supply disruption n ed to be addressed cma

by the cma health and safety committees labeling task group for a  printing after presentation to the executive committee and board the draft standard will enter the ansi consensus process by which cma member companies interested industry groups labor unions government agencies consumer coalitions and professional societies review and vote on the standard final submission to the ansi board of review is projected for mid significance of ansi z the  revision of ansi z is particularly relevant to the chemical industry for the following reasons o the osha hazard cosstunication standard requires labeling of all hazardous industrial chemicals and chemical mixtures o in  osha field inspectors issued citations to cma member companies for a variety of labeling violations including the lack of target organsystem hazard warnings on labels o the performanceoriented nature of the osha hazard communica tion standard and the complementary generic labeling guide lines in ansi z provide both guidance and flexibility to cma member companies o a litigious trend toward industry liability for alleged occupational illnesses has put the industry at risk for failure to fulfill the duty to warn primary issues in ansi z o in light of the regulatory and liability issues listed above ansi z focuses for the first time on labeling of delayed chronic hazards and target organ system hazards o guidance for immediate acute hazards has been revised  o as ouch s possible all guidelines in the standard have been compared and adjusted for compliance with hey regulatory statutes eg the oska
