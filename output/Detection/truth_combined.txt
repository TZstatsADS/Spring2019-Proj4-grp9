STAFF REPORT
Ma rch 1972
by
William J. Driver
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION...
...involving portions of the Foreign Trade and Investment Act of
'1972 suddenly loomed as a possibility last week when it was learned
that the AFL-CIO planned to attempt attaching Titles VI and VII of
that proposed Act to the Administration's gold legislation.
Through agreement with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Wilbur D. Mills (D.-Ark.), the House Banking and Currency Committee
has been given jurisdiction over Titles VI and VII of the so-called
The latter committee scheduled gold bill hearings March 1-6 and,
immediately afterward, is expected to begin executive session mark­
Rapid enactment is anticipated.
Organized labor's position, to be presented the last day of hear­
ings, is that dollar devaluation in itself does not provide adequate
remedies and that the stronger measures embodied in the Hartke-Burke
bill are needed.
Title VI of that measure would empower the President to prohibit:
Any transactions involving direct or indirect transfer
of capital to or within any foreign country when, in
his judgment, the transfer would result in a net de­
crease in L). S. employment, and
Any holder of a U. S. patent from manufacturing the
patented product, using the patented process, licens­
ing others to manufacture the patented product or using
the patented process outside United States territory
when, in the President's judgment, such prohibition
will contribute to increased employment in the United
States .
Title VII would require onerous reporting provisions including
complete statistics on working conditions in multinational com­
panies outside the United States as well as or> products and their
distribution.
It also imposes burdensome requirements for labeling
and advertising.
After key House committee members were alerted to organized labor's
strategy, assurances were obtained that the gold legislation would
be kept free of encumbering amendments and that the Hartke-Burke
measures would be ruled non-germane.
On March 1, the Senate approved the gold legislation required by
the President to implement negotiated international monetary agree­
ments .

THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE ENVIRONMENT...
...has begun executive session consideration of pending toxic
substances legislation.
On February 11, the Subcommittee staff
made public Working Draft No. 1.
We were invited to submit for con­
sideration a memorandum dealing with Section 24 of that document.
It was prepared by our General Counsel and submitted on February 16.
Additional changes and improvements were recommended in more com­
prehensive comments on February 25 in a letter to the Acting Subcom­
mittee Chairman, Senator William B. Spong (D.-Va.).
We emphasized
our concern over certain provisions relative to premarket testing of
chemical substances and pointed out other needed improvements.
THE HOUSE PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE STAFF...
...has insisted for some time that the language of the pending
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments, H. R.1 1896, would
would be made public on March 1. However, present indications are
it will not be released until mid or late March. The Committee's
formal report is expected about the same time.
Consideration by the House Rules Committee will take place
prior to House floor action. The measure could reach Senate-House
conference before Easter.
A HOUSE-SENATE CONFERENCE...
...has approved legislation that would require the Equal Employ­
ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to seek court enforcement of its
findings of job discrimination.
Prompt approval by both houses and
President Nixon is expected.
The Senate version of the measure generally prevailed, broaden­
ing EE0C|s purview to government and educational employees as well
as reducing from 25 to 15 the number of workers in a company or
union coming under its jurisdiction.
A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY BILL...
...which passed the House last October, is currently under con­
sideration in the Senate Government Operations Subcommittee on Exec­
utive Reorganization.
This bill, S. 1177, would establish an independent Consumer Pro­
tection Agency authorized to intervene on behalf of consumers in
any Federal agency where business regulation generally is at issue.
In addition, the new agency could seek judicial review of any de­
cision by a Federal agency that is considered to be contrary to the
interests of consumers.

Government
alerted MCA legislative contacts to the disruptive and
effects of this measure, suggesting that affected companies
their opposition--particularly to members of the Senate
Operations Committee.
The Executive Operations Subcommittee is expected to begin marking
up this bill within the next three or four weeks.
OVERSIGHT HEARINGS . . .
...on implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 were
held recently -- on January 26-28 by Representative Paul G. Rogers
(D.-Fla.), of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce
and on February 16-18, 23-25 by Senator Thomas F. Eagleton (D.-Mo.),
of the Senate Committee on Public Works.
Particular concern was expressed by Democratic members of the
Congress that the Office of Management and Budget (0MB) was inter­
ceding in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) affairs, contrary
to the intent of the Congress.
Persistently attacked was EPA's
delay in issuing state "Requirements for Preparation, Adoption,
and Submittal of Implementation Plans."
EPA's Administrator,
Mr. Ruckelshaus, had delayed their publication in order to revise
them.
He deleted implications that approval of state plans would
depend on inclusion of specified regulatory provisions and clearly
identified them as possible state options, thus allowing for alter­
native control strategies.
Democrats and environmentalists alleged this change was the
result of political pressures applied through 0MB.
However, Mr.
Ruckelshaus defended the legal and technological soundness of his
actions.
AS INDICATED IN THE FEBRUARY REPORT...
...written testimony developed by our International Trade
Committee has been presented to the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign
Commerce and Tourism in connection with their hearings on S. 2754,
the Export Expansion Act of 1971.
By letter on February 29 to the Committee's Chairman, Senator
Daniel K. Inouye (D.-Hi.), we reiterated our position on:
Upgrading commercial attaches,
Using industry advisors during trade negotiations,
Strengthening Export-Import Bank operations.
Easing restraints on bank export financing.
Ending freight rate disparities,
Permitting more activities in foreign trade zones.
Easing access to drawback opportunities,
Ending foreign direct investment controls, and on
Qualifying all export earnings for DISC operations.

Two specific recommendations were to:
1) Require, by law, government use of business
advisors in international trade negotiations.
2) Subsidize directly, rather than indirectly, operation
of the U. S. Merchant Marine as a means of ending freight
rate disparities.
...were the topic at a meeting on February 24 at MCA Headquarters.
Discussion centered on reported findings of medical researchers con­
cerning phthalate extraction by blood when stored in bags made of
phthalate-plasticized polyvinyl chloride film, and observances of
birth defects in rats when injected with types of phthalate esters
used as plasticizers in plastics, particularly polyvinyl chloride.
Forty-five representatives of 31 companies attended.
They wish
to consider the development of a technical program, and eight com­
panies volunteered representatives as an Ad Hoc Planning Group on
Phthalate Studies, with the understanding that any program proposal #
involving MCA administration would require your approval.
THE ASSOCIATION...
...has extended its agreement with The University of Michigan to
maintain a registry of cases of acroosteolysis (fingertip bone lesions)
and to provide a consultation center for industry.

Funded by contributions from 19 polyvinyl chloride manufacturers,
the extension continues a program which began with an extensive in­
vestigation of the clinical, epidemiological, and industrial hygiene
aspects of this syndrome among polyvinyl chloride production workers.
...as a pollution-prevention measure, has proposed regulations
concerning the design and construction of vessels and the operation
of terminal facilities in oil transfer operations.
In general, member companies have no objection to the proposal.
However, since we believe some modification is necessary to provide
for appropriate review, preserve uniformity with present regulations
and clarify intent of some of the proposals, our comments were sub­
mitted to the Coast Guard on February 15.
THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION...
CMA 036193
...scheduled a modified procedure in response to our complaint
concerning deficiencies in the tank car mileage allowance system
adopted by railroads, requesting written comment by February 22.
However, that date did not allow us sufficient time and our request
for a 90-day extension was granted.
We may ultimately request
oral argument if the modified procedure appears inadequate to as­
sure a complete record.

Two new booklets are upcoming.
A career guidance booklet, "A
Challenge For Growth," will replace "Careers Ahead In The Chemical
Industry." And, "What Is Chemical Change" is currently being dis­
tributed in experimental form prior to publication. Authored by
Elbert C. Weaver, it presents lecture demonstrations for elementary
schools.
The Association's combined Education-Consumer Information Exhibit
elicited substantial interest and discussion at the Annual Conven­
tion of the American Association of School Administrators in Atlantic
City, February 12-16.
The same exhibit will be on display March 5-8
in Philadelphia at the Annual Convention of The Association for
Supervision and Curriculum Development and at the Annual Convention
of the National Science Teachers' Association in New York City, April
Two symposia, in recognition of the MCA Centennial, will be co­
sponsored by the Association and the American Chemical Society on
April 10 and 12 during the latter's Annual Convention in Boston.
One, under the Division of Chemical Education, Inc, will feature a
discussion on continuing education.
The other, under the Division
of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, will be devoted to "Indus­
trial-Academic Cooperation in the Seventies."
On April 13, the day before a scheduled Education
Activities
Committee (EAC) meeting, EAC members will participate in an Inter­
face Conference with the ECIS* group of students at the Massachusetts

CMA03611
Finally, the EAC, through MCA's Manager of Education, Dr. Robert
E. Varnerin, is collaborating with the National Science Foundation
(NSF) in proposing an Experimental Research and Development Incen­
tives Program for NSF funding.
If approved by the Congress, the
program will promote the exchange of personnel between industry and
schools on a sabbatical or internship basis and provide R 4 D funds
for non-defense research in industry.
A budget of $22 million has
been proposed.
Proposed
Research Program
on
Mechanisms of Phosgene Injury to the Lungs
EXHIBIT A
Purpose
The purpose of this program, to be collectively funded by voluntary sub­
scriptions from interested companies, is to provide information on the basic
mechanisms Involved in phosgene damage to the lungs. This information is a
prerequisite for the determination of a reconmended method of medical treat­
ment of industrial exposures to phosgene.
Initial Project
As recommended by the Ad Hoc Task Group on Phosgene Safety composed of
representatives of interested member companies, the lnaediate project is that
defined in the proposal made by Or. M. F, Frosolono of the.Mt. Sinai Hospital
of Cleveland in a letter to MCA dated August 23, 1972. This project Is to be
conducted under contracts (a) between MCA and Mt. Sinai Hospital of Cleveland,
not to exceed $30,000 and (b) between MCA and Dr. Frosolono for consulting fees
regarding the research referred to in (a), not to exceed $3,000.
Supervision
This research is to be supervised on MCA's behalf by a Technical Task Group
composed of one technical representative from each subscribing company plus an
MCA staff representative to serve as secretary.
Organizationally within MCA, the Task Group is to function under the Juris­
diction of the Safety and Fire Protection Comnittee.
Funding
Consnitments have been made by thirteen interested companies in support of
this research, up to $3,500 per company. Funds are to be collected in advance
of commitments, and disbursements subject to MCA staff clearance and approval.
Stipulations
The scientific information developed from this program is to be fully dis­
closed without restriction. For purposes of consistency and control, however,
all releases are to be made through MCA only, normally based on Task Force recom­
mendations as to nature and timing. This requirement is not to preclude pri­
vate scientific Interchange of non'competitive information which will be useful,
nor relevant private cosnunlcation among subscribing companies and organizations;
the staff representative to be informed of all such interchanges and communications.
Operation
The Task Group will be governed by MCA's "General Principles Applicable to
the Structure and Operations of Conmittees" and the Rules of Organization and
Procedure of the Safety and Fire Protection Committee.

Report of
Education Activities Committee
to
Manufacturing Chemists Association
November 20, 1972
By Henry W. Rahn, Chairman
It is three years since the EAC Committee last reported directly to this Board.
In the interim, several significant developments have occurred affecting the area
wherein the Committee functions - namely, the industrial-academic interface. These
include: first - employment opportunities for new technical graduates in the chemical
industry shrank to low levels; seeond - a wave of technical staff reductions by job
termination ran through the industry in 1970 and 1971; and third - society's attitude
toward our industry underwent deterioration to where we now labor under the burden of
a negative public image. It is most appropriate, therefore, and I welcome this op­
portunity to review for you the Committee's objectives, plans and activities, structured
to meet our assignment and responsibility to the MCA under conditions so changed from
the past.
COMMITTEE EVOLUTION
The Committee was first established in the mid 50's when, as you will recall, there
was a shortage of graduate chemists. The initial objective was to encourage students
i pursue a career in chemistry, so as to assure an adequate supply of chemists for the
xpanding needs of our industry.
Until the mid 60's, the Committee continued to follow a program of recruiting students
into chemistry. But then some red flags went up, when careful reviews of technical
graduate supply-demand studies lad several of our members to predict that the high post
World War II birth rates would result in an oversupply of chemists in the early 70's. The
rough coincidence of this graduate oversupply timing, with the economic downturn of the
chemical industry beginning in 1969, and the layoffs of employed chemists and chemical
engineers which ensued, accelerated the rate at which the oversupply of unemployed
ch mically-trained persons was growing. As of earlier this year, 25% of all chemists 26
years of age or less were unemployed. Faced with these unsettling aspects in the job
market, the Committee decided to modify its objectives. Instead of stressing recruitment,
we began to focus on the quality and type of training suitable for chemists going into
industry.
CMA 036213
FUTURE TECHNICAL MANPOWER SUPPLY-DEMAND RELATIONSHIP
In looking ahead, we are confronted with a highly confused picture concerning the
future demand-supply relationship for new graduate scientific and engineering man­
power. Major long-range studies reaching into the 1980's by such prestigious groups
as the National Science Foundation, Scientific Manpower Commission, Engineering
Manpower Commission of the Joint Engineers Council and the U. S. Department of
Labor reach varying forecasts, ranging from prediction of years of oversupply to dire
warnings of impending shortages.
Perhaps this is to be expected as the nation grapples with the problem of changing
priorities and shifting activities. And in view of this, it would appear that the use of
historical trend data for predicting technical manpower supplies ten years from now forces
some degree of uncertainty into the forecasts. But the weight of the evidence seems to
lie on the side of an impending shortage. The short-range forecasts, on the other hand,
as mode by similarly competent groups, are considered to be much more reliable. We
can discuss these figures with more confidence. In general, such studies predict we
will experience a sharp downward trend in B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees awarded in
chemistry and all engineering during the next four years.
If this downward trend continues, there is reason to believe that a shortage of some
proportions could develop in the supply of scientific and engineering graduates. As
responsible members of the chemical industry, I believe there is cause for us to be
- concerned over both the short and long range situation. I will not burden you with a
complete statistical analysis that supports this conclusion, but here are some significant
details.
First, undergraduate enrollments for majors in chemistry have historically increased
modestly each year. In 1970, however, the number of ft.. S. degrees awarded in
chemistry declined for the first time in 20 years. We conclude that a high "drop out"
rate between entry and graduation for chemistry majors has taken place.
Second, the number of first year graduate students in Ph.D. chemistry programs has
declined 25% since 1966. Statistics for each year indicate an increased number of
students who earn a degree in chemistry only as a "stepping stone" to careers in other
fields.
Third, undergraduate enrollments and earned degrees in engineering are declining
significantly. From the total engineering bachelor supply of 43,000 graduating in
1971, the output in 1975 is expected to fall to 31,000.
Against this background of rapidly-declining interest in scientific and engineering
degrees, there are some that claim that even larger decreases in the employed technical
woricforce may be necessary, as an adjustment to changing R & D priorities. If this be­
comes nee ssary, I susp ct w will find the students moving ever farther away from the
chemical industry, a developm nt we would all like to avoid if possible.
CMA 036214
The chemical industry, as you well know, is an industry of great complexity,
requiring many high level intellects to effectively develop, manage and operate
the enterprise. Our future ability to attract such individuals in the numbers required
will depend largely on the prestige of the occupation, working conditions and personal
opportunities for growth.
In attempting to assess future requirements for new graduate chemists and chemical
engineers, we make the prediction this number will remain a reasonably stable percentage
f the total industrial workforce. At the risk of oversimplification, we have reached this
conclusion by assuming two important opposing demand trends will tend to balance each
other. The downward trend involved R/D. During the past 25 years, i^ft activities
accounted for a large fraction of total technical employment. With this fraction tending
to become smaller, as R/D is de-emphasized, one can logically reason future needs for
chemists and chemical engineers in this area will diminish. On the other hand, an
upward trend involving newly-emerging problem areas, such as environmental control
and the impending energy crisis, which heretofore have not been factors of any signifi­
cance as users or chemically trained personnel, could possibly impose heavy future de­
mands against supply, offsetting losses in the I^D sector of the chemical industry. Con­
sequently, we believe continued reductions in chemistry and engineering majors and
earned degrees will likely leadto shortages of technical graduate manpower resources.
In view of the uncertainty surrounding future needs, it is tempting to adopt a "wait and
see" attitude. The Committee counsels against this, because to do so will undermine
the attractiveness of chemistry and the chemical industry as a oareer choice for students.
. Further, it will likely intensify the negative image many students and young faculty,
specially in non-science areas, have for the chemical and other technically-oriented
industry. And above all, we must bear in mind that the manpower problems we anticipate
in four or eight years are, in fact, today's problems because the new chemists and engineers
' we will hire then are in the educational pipeline now.
RESTORATION OF CONFIDENCE IN INDUSTRY
If you agree with me that there has indeed been a loss of confidence by the student body
in our industry, the question then arises as to what steps we can take to restore it. We
of the Committee feel this is a serious matter that should be promptly dealt with in some
positive way. In conjunction with the Public Relations Committee, we are organizing an
effort to define a program for your consideration. Meanwhile, I urge you to give, with
us, serious consideration to this matter so that the MCA and the industry can have an
important continuing influence on the educational system and on national manpower
planning commissions.
OBJECTIVES - PLANS - ACTIVITIES - ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Against the foregoing background, I would now like to report on our current programs
and activities. In 1971, the Board approved a realignment of our objectives and function
according t the greatly altered mployment and economic eonditi ns confr nting member
companies. Our objective became: "To promote through the educational system
public understanding of the chemical industry; to assist in career guidance; to enhance
the quality of education in chemistry, chemical engineering and interdisciplinary
fields related to chemistry; to promote the teaching of chemistry and related sciences
in a broad intellectual, cultural and social context at all levels of education." We
thus reaffirmed our primary mission to collaborate with educators and educational
systems. Our activities were then reorganized and channeled into three categories,
all judged to be of importance in attaining our objectives. These are:
Q
I
i
career guidance
chemical education
public understanding of the chemical industry
Each area of concern is assigned to a separate mibcommittee. Concerning their work,
the following is of interest.
CAREER GUIDANCE SUBCOMMITTEE
This group finds itself in the paradoxical situation of motivating students toward chemistry
at a time when trained scientists are unemployed. This contrasts with a past period of
more than two decades when expansion and growth of the industry assured multiple job
opportunities for each new chemist. Employment prospects prevailing at the time a
student made a career decision remained essentially unchanged 4 or 8 or 10 years later
when he entered the job market. Specialization was the "name of the game"; career
objectives for specific positions could be described succinctly in terms of course require­
ments and skills. Career guidance was then a very legitimate facet of recruitment in
advance, when there are concrete job openings. Only recently have some associations,
professional societies and companies abandoned this activity in view of changed conditions.
Some few years ago the Career Guidance Subcommittee began to redirect its efforts to
give greater emphasis to the variety of tasks performed in the chemical industry. There
is a continuing need for people with a chemical background but, as you know, the ap­
plication of their education and training might not conform to the traditional and
academic image of the chemist or chemical engineer. The subcommittee encourages
those with particular ability and interest in chemistry to a career in R & D. However,
for most in industry, the translation of theoretical information into practical realities
such as administration, marketing, personnel, liaison with government and public re­
lations defines “where the action is." Consequently, an education should be directed
to the broad spectrum of job opportunities and develop the individual interests and
skills of the student.
Several experimental career booklets were developed to present the new approach to
more than 4,500 educators, students and administrators who requested copies. A new
edition of the booklet will be distributed early next year, incorporating many helpful
suggesti ns received from teachers and students.
CMA 036216
|t is courageous to phase out old and luccessful programs and innovate when our
career guidance efforts rode the crest of the wave of acceptance among educators
and students. During the 1971-1972 fiscal year, for example, we filled requests
for more than 30,000 career booklets and 10,000 flyers. It is preferable, as you
will agree, to be ahead of change rather than unwitting victims of it.
This subcommittee also assists and encourages the increased number of those who
elect chemistry as a cultural background or as a foundation for careers in fields
such as medicine, law and marketing which have competing claims on technicallytrained men and women.
CHEMICAL EDUCATION SUBCOMMITTEE
This group spearheads efforts to influence chemical education. As a measure of our
success and acceptance among academic chemists during the past two years, members
f our committee have been participants by invitation at three major chemical education
conferences and at tke White House Conference on Youth. In the past year, we
collaborated, by invitation, with the National Science Foundation in the preliminary
planning and implementation of a new educational program in which industry and the
academe will jointly study the process of innovation and of expediting the process by
which new ideas are transferred into curricula or marketable products.
The work of this subcommittee is now focused in three areas:
College and High School Teacher Awards
Influence on Curricula
Interface Conferences
' College Awards; Since 19S7, MCA has honored 75 outstanding professors of chemistry
and chemical engineering. As one of the foremost national awards on the college level
in the U.S. and Canada, the program has attained prestige and is considered by many
r cent recipients as the pinnacle of their teaching careers.
In 1972, the six medalists were featured in a cover study in Chemical and Engineering
News and a cover headline in the Journal of Chemical Education, a first for MCA in
each of these magazines. In 1972, we received more than 430 inquiries and processed 182
nominations; both figures represent a high for the program. As of this date, we have proe ssed 294 inquiries and 74 nominations for the 1973 program.
V*IT
In the last two years we conferred five college awards on the campus of the recipient.
S veral of you represented MCA at these ceremonies and contributed to this new
dimension of industry-education contact. As a result of these campus ceremonies,
several major institutions re-evaluated their programs honoring excellence among their
faculty, another plans to initiate an honors convocation and another broke an old
tradition and gave public notice of the award at commencement.
CMA 036217
6
Our college awards have been one of our least expensive but highest return
activities.
High School Awards: Since 1964, MCA has honored more than 199 secondary school
teachers with local awards of $200. The program, administered by Chemical Industry
Councils, was restricted to teachers within the locale of the council. In 1973,
we will open the program, making any teacher in the U.S. and Canada eligible for
a regional award of $200 or for the new national award of $1,000. The expanded
program has aroused an enthusiastic response. To date, we have processed 66 requests
for information and nomination forms.
Influence on Curricula; For almost 10 years the Chemical Education Subcommittee
has promoted the inclusion of practical chemistry from industry into chemistry courses
on the high school and lower college levels. When we first made the suggestion, our
message went unheeded among educators who intensified the theoretical content of
their chemistry courses. Recently, other associations, professional societies, major
chemical education conferences and educators concur with our proposal. We collaborate
with educators to ensure that the industrial world of chemistry is a necessary adjunct to
theory.
In 1967, the first title in a 10 book, MCA-sponsored "Chemistry in Action Series" was
published by Doubleday. The books related practical stories and personal accounts of
the world of industry. Almost 100,000 copies, like the two samples I have here, have
been sold to enrich high school and lower level college chemistry courses. Eight of
these titles appear in foreign language editions similar to this Japanese version of
Water is Everybody's Business, and one title in a U.S. Information Service edition in
Ind ia. the ftooks beportment of the American Chemical Society now publishes the
series. We cooperate in enlisting authors and assisting in the preparation of manuscripts .
Since 1961, Holt, Rinehard and Winston published four MCA-sponsored innovative
laboratory manuals for elementary and secondary schools. More than 165,000 copies
have been sold. MCA is widely known and esteemed for this service. We will request
modest funding to up-date one of these manuals in the next fiscal year.
We canvassed member companies and mode significant suggestions for the Objectives
and Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Chemistry for the Committee on Prof ssional Training of ACS. John Howard of Kodak, member of both our and the ACS
committee, summarized and submitted our recommendations. In the past six months,
the chairman of the ACS committee acknowledged our contributions before more than 300
chairmen of college chemistry departments and, on another occasion, before more than 450
educators.
Interface Conferences; We initiated experimental and innovative conferences of
students, educators and industrial people. We have seen the effectiveness and
predict an increasing need for this type of dialog. Members of the subcommittee share
their exp rience with member companies who have organized similar sessions.

PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SUBCOMMITTEE
The third and newest subcommittee of the Education Activities Committee promotes
gr ater public understanding of the chemical industry through the educational system.
Their efforts are directed primarily to the non-science student and faculty who harbor
a negative attitude toward technically-oriented industry. Many of these apostles,
to be sure, have the naivete of youth but share with us in industry a bigness of concern
f r society. Their zeal and energies seek direction toward constructive as well as
destructive goals. Though some would "write off" this group as ignorant, our contact
with them through interface seminars indicates that they have done their homework well
but often lack an over-all and balanced view of a particular problem. They are un­
informed, for the most part, of the accomplishments of industry for society. However,
they are open and willing to learn and change their attitudes.
The subcommittee coordinates its efforts with Mrs. Walton's Consumer Information
Subcommittee. We make suitable education materials available to Mrs. Walton's
committee and distribute their materials designed to educate the general public
through our education channels. On three occasions we combined the Consumer Inf rmation and Education exhibits to stretch our exhibit dollars and to reach new audiences
f science and non-science oriented publics. At the suggestion of the Consumer Information
group, we published a manual of simple chemical demonstrations suitable for the general
public and have another manual of simple food experiments in the rough manuscript staga.
MCA's education exhibit provides us the opportunity to present all our programs and
t discuss them with educators. This past year more than 2,500 educators visited our
booth at one regional and three national education conferences. This year we have
scheduled six exhibits in all sections of the U.S. and seek similar contacts with
Canadian educators.
The two subcommittees also coordinated their efforts in presenting the seminar
"Catalyst '72 — Is Science Necessary”?, which I hope many of you were able to
attend this morning.
The impact of electronic media on this generation indicates that the printed word
is no longer the only effective avenue of communication. An experimental tape
for campus radio, classroom or private listening was produced. Film clips, slide
lectures and audio courses are some of the means of communication which we will
propose to you for future budget allocations.
As I indicated earlier, there is on the drawing boards a joint task force with the Public
Relations Committee to study the negative image of industry among youth and make
recommendations on what industry can do to stem the tide of unfair criticism which, as
you know, often creates the unfavorable climate for adverse and restrictive legislation.
Our work, like public relations, is never ending. There is no such thing as a stable or
one-time public. Publics are like rivers - more water always feeding into a stream
which never stands still and n ver is quite the same at any one point of reference.
CMA 036219
Thii about brings ma to the and of my report.
Before closing, I would like to thank you, the member companies who are represented
on the Committee and the staff of the MCA, for the strong support given the EAC.
The Committee membership is listed in the new MCA directory. The individuals named
and the MCA staff form a team of highly motivated, dedicated, competent professionals
of varied disciplines giving great breadth of experience to our work. From a purely
personal point of view, may I say it is both a pleasure and a privilege to work with
them.
In this brief report, I have listed only the highlights of our problems, accomplishments
and future plans. I am sure that you have many other questions related to our work. I
will be happy to respond either before you adjourn this meeting or later.
I thank you.

The purpose of this program is to provide scientific
information to clarify the status of vinyl chloride (monomer)
in reference to carcinogenicity.
Proj ect
As recommended by an Ad Hoc Planning Group for Vinyl
Chloride Research, composed of representatives of eight MCA
member companies, the project is to contract for animal test­
ing research under which experimental animals would inhale
vinyl chloride monomer vapor at selected concentration levels
and be examined in accord with an agreed-upon testing and
examination protocol.
Planned duration of the project is
three years.
According to quotations from Industrial Bio-Test
Laboratories, Inc., with which the contract is in prospect,
and an allowance for vinyl chloride supply and contingencies,
the projected cost is $193,000.
Funding
Funding commitments have been received from seventeen
MCA member companies sufficient in the aggregate to cover the
stated cost. Company shares are pro-rated on the basis of
publicly announced tonnage production capacity for vinyl
chloride monomer plus polyvinyl chloride.
Disbursements are to be subject to MCA staff clearance
and approval.
Supervision
The program is to be supervised on MCA's behalf by a
Technical Task Group on Vinyl Chloride Research composed of
one technical representative from each subscribing company,
plus an MCA staff representative to serve as secretary.
Administratively, the Task Group is to function under
the jurisdiction of the Occupational Health Committee.
CMA 036228
Stipulations
The scientific information developed from this program
is to be fully disclosed, without restriction.
For purposes
of consistency and control, however, all releases are to be
made solely through MCA, normally based on Task Group rec­
ommendations as to nature and timing.
This requirement would
not preclude private scientific interchange of non-competitive
information useful to advancement of the program, nor relevant
private communication within and among subscribing companies.
It would be an obligation to inform the MCA staff representa­
tive on a current basis about all such related interchanges
and communications other than those internal to the company.
Operation
The Task Group is to be governed by the requirements of
MCA's "General Principles Applicable to the Structure and Op­
erations of Committees" and the Rules of Organization and Pro­
cedure of the Occupational Health Committee.

TAX REFORM...hearings before the House Ways and
mittee are likely to begin early in the next session
As long ago as last June, that Committee's Chairman,
Mills (D.-Ark.), indicated the issue would be number
ority.
Means Com­
of Congress.
Wilbur
one pri­
Less certain is the nature and scope of such hearings.
While various members of Congress have announced that they will
sponsor "loophole-plugging" bills. Mills has avoided advocating
sweeping reforms.
The Administration is expected to introduce its tax reform
proposal early in order to take the initiative.
Comments by
various Treasury Department officials indicate the Administra­
tion will emphasize tax simplification rather than substantive
reform.
Treasury Under Secretary Edwin S. Cohen stated recently
that he expected Congress to take under consideration the Asset
Depreciation Range (ADR) system, the investment taut credit, and
the minimum tax on tax preference income.
It is also expected
that capital gains will come up for congressional review.
Some Administration officials have been advocating early
Congressional consideration of trade reform legislation ahead of
tax legislation, both of which are handled by the House Ways
and Means Committee. Mr. Mills is reported to have indicated
that he would put trade legislation before tax reform if President
Nixon should request it. We understand, however, that the
President has not yet made a decision on either the nature of
trade legislation to be proposed by the Administration, or on
the tactical issue of when to present it.
TRADE POLICY...in the new Nixon Administration will operate
under new leadership.
The President has indicated that, in addition to his Cabinet
duties, Treasury Secretary Shultz will take charge of overall
economic policy.
The imminent departure of Commerce Secretary Peterson should
restore the Department of State to some eminence in trade policy
matters.
No changes have been indicated so far in the Office of the
Special Trade Representative.
However, the President has
accepted r signations from a number of International Economic
Policy Council staff memb rs, presently headed by Peter Flanigan.

THE CONTROVERSY...over tank car mileage allowances continues.
On November 24, the railroads filed a reply to statements by
MCA and other intervenors with the Interstate Commerce Commission
The railroads:
Resist updating of base classification values (BCV's) ,
attacking the basic system and claiming that a single
percentage trending factor is inappropriate,
Criticized our proposal to raise the value ceiling to
$40,000, contending that linings and special materials
relate to the "package" function of a tank car, and
Continued legal objections to ICC's power to prescribe
specific allowances.
The railroad document was lengthy.
Therefore, to permit
adequate evaluation and response, additional time to comment was
requested in our behalf and that of the American Petroleum
Institute, car lining companies and other supporters.
Four
weeks were granted; reply statements are now due January 8, 1973.
NIOSH...the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health, is conducting a National Occupational Hazard Survey —
a statistical study designed to collect pertinent information
regarding biological, physical and chemical exposures to indus­
trial workers. Accompanied by management representatives, NIOSH
surveyors tour industrial plants, noting exposures to different
occupational groups.
Seventy-five percent of the data collected is reported as
exposures to trade name compounds.
However, the Institute's
ultimate goal is to develop information on exposures to specific
chemicals, not trade name products.
Therefore, NIOSH desires
ingredient information for each trade name item reported to
them.
To obtain this information they propose to send a letter
and a "request form" (one for each trade name product) to about
5000 manufacturers.
Response would be mandatory.
There is obvious concern that trade secret information
might leak from the NIOSH files.
Therefore a panel meeting
under the Office of Management and Budget is being arranged,
and MCA companies will have an opportunity to express their
views regarding the need for assurances of confidentiality
beyond those already expressed in the Occupational Safety and
Health Act.

Proposed
Epidemiological Study on Vinyl Chloride
Supplementary to the animal testing program on
vinyl chloride (monomer) approved in January 1973 for
MCA administration, there is a desire to proceed now
with an epidemiological study of the medical records of
industrially exposed workers.
Companies that are also supporting the animal
testing program have volunteered funds on the same sub­
scription basis to defray anticipated costs ranging
from a probable minimum of $72,000 up to a tentatively
estimated maximum of about $92,000.
Tabershaw-Cooper Associates, Inc., Berkeley,
Calif., has been chosen to conduct the study, after
consideration of several candidates.
A time period of
eight months has been projected.
Management of the project on behalf of MCA would
follow the same pattern as provided for the animal
testing program.

FINAL REPORT
The objective of this committee, formed at the February-Executive
Committee meeting, was to study how to make MCA more effective, with
particular reference to, but not limited to, Washington and government
relations. A preliminary report was made to the Executive Committee
and to the Board in March, and several suggestions were approved.
The committee feels that this report represents only a first step
towards strengthening MCA and that the effectiveness of MCA ought to be
reviewed annually by the Executive Committee and the Board.
Discussions with a cross section of Board members, MCA staff,
and member company personnel serving on MCA committees and on the
Washington scene pointed to a central need and opportunity to improve
communications. The committee believes MCA's communications can be
improved in a number of areas by eliminating layering, sharpening objec­
tives, focusing efforts on key groups, and coordinating the activities of
various parts of the Association.
Therefore, the following steps are recommended to strengthen
MCA's communications:1
1. The agenda for Board meetings should be revamped to include
additional reports from chairmen of technical and functional committees,
a regular review of legislative activity by the Director of Government Re­
lations, and periodic reports from other MCA staff members, as set forth
in the recommended agenda attached as Exhibit A. The four Board Liaison
Committees should be eliminated. Also, the scene should be set in a way
CMA 036303
that will permit pointed questioning regarding, and critical discussion of,
MCA affairs.
2. At least two more Board meetings should be held each year in
Washington to focus attention on governmental matters and to facilitate con­
tacts with government personnel. A recommended schedule of Board meet­
ings for 1973-74 is attached as Exhibit B.
3. Closer communication between Executive Contacts, especially
thoae who are MCA Board members, and personnel from their companies
who serve on technical and functional committees is very much in order and
needs to be encouraged.
4. The Executive Committee, in conformity with suggested changes
in Board procedures and in addition to its present activities, should make an
annual review of MCA1 a effectiveness, including the work of, as well as the
need for, the various committees. Any action which would have a significant
financial impact should be decided upon prior to January, when development
of the budget begins. The Executive Committee should also formulate a list
of the most critical issues facing the industry and indicate those issues for
which MCA positions should be developed.
A letter should be sent from the Chairman of the Board to all
Executive Contacts following the June 1973 Greenbrier meeting outlining the
newly adopted approaches and procedures for the 1973-74 MCA year, and
soliciting their active interest and participation.
Board Meetings
The agenda for Board meetings will be prepared by the President,
following consultation as appropriate with the Chairman of the Board and
sent to the Directors well in advance of meetings. Routine business of the
Association should be dealt with briefly on the assumption that Directors had
read the material which was supplied prior to the meeting.
Of considerable importance is the arrangement of the agenda in such
a way that there can be appropriate questioning and discussion regarding
important MCA matters. At some past meetings, several Board members
have felt the opportunity for meaningful discussion was limited or precluded.
Providing for frank deliberation will permit a fuller contribution from the
Board and will recognize the considerable investment of time by Board mem­
bers. However, this increased participation by the Board in MCA affairs
should not be permitted to diminish the role and the effectiveness of the Ex­
ecutive Committee.
The President would present first an overview of MCA's situation,
providing perspective and priorities with regard to important issues, op­
portunities, and problems.
CMA 036304
This would be'followed by a brief legislative report from the
Director of Government Relations plus reports from any other members
of the MCA staff who have an important matter to bring to the Board's
attention.
Next, three or four chairmen of technical or functional com­
mittees would report on substantive matters pending in those committees.
Routine organizational matters and accomplishments should be excluded.
The four Board Liaison Committees have helped a great deal, but there
is a prevailing opinion that the growing complexity and importance of the
issues the industry is facing require the active and direct involvement of
the Board, and that to shorten communications lines the liaison Commit­
tees should be dissolved.
One-third of the 24 MCA committees currently have chairmen
from companies which are not represented on the Board. When one of
these chairmen reports to the Board, the Executive Contact from his com­
pany should be invited to attend the meeting.
The above format would normally take two hours, and this time
should be regularly allotted in planning schedules.
Two more Washington Board meetings (January and October)
would improve communications considerably. Such meetings would also
help focus Board attention on the critical matters in the governmental
area, and provide an opportunity the night before the Board meeting for
members to have dinner with government people. The successful Chemical
Forum luncheons would be tied in the next day. Good staff work and coor­
dinated efforts are called for here to see that MCA interests are effectively
conveyed to the government.
With regard to regional Board meetings, the Program Commit­
tee ought to devote special attention to increasing their value to those at­
tending by providing a program which contributes insight into regional
industry interests, especially governmental activities.
Government Relations Activity
Communications among the Government Relations staff, other
MCA staff members, the technical and functional committees, and Wash­
ington representatives of member companies should be improved through
more formalized procedures.
In the past, MCA has been stymied at times by an inability to
reach unanimous agreement in the various committees on what position to
take and by a cumbersome clearance procedure. In the future, commit­
tees should try to proceed promptly to a decision and where unanimity is
unattainable, majority and minority views should be referred to the Execu­
tive Committee for consideration.

Proposed Ret ntion of Economic Consultant to Supply the
Economic Data for the chemical Industry's Position on
the Industrial Reorganization Act (Hart Bill - S. 1167)
LEGAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE
ECONOMIC POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEE
senator Hart has introduced a bill (S. 1167) intended to facili­
tate the breaking-up of large corporations in a number of industries,
including the chemical industry. Hearings before his Subcommitt e
cn Antitrust and Monopoly of the Senate Judiciary Committee began
L?st year and will continue during this year and next.
There have
already been two series of hearings on the general merits or demer­
its of the bill, and one series devoted to communications, parti­
cularly the Bell System.
A series on the automobile industry will
begin February 26.
The chemical industry is not likely to have its
day in court for many months to come.
While there is little prospect of the enactment of S. 1167 in
its present form, there is a danger that some elements of it may
become law.
Moreover, the Hart hearings are a forum in which major
industries are under public attack, and the chemical industry should
be ready to- defend itself.
It is not possible at this point to pre­
dict the character of the hearings on our industry. As in the case
of the Bell System, one major company may be chosen for attack.
»5 seems likely to be the case with the motor industry, our ‘entire
industry may be exposed to rigorous review.
It is not known at prebent whether MCA will be asked to appear—nor has it been decided
whether, if not asked, MCA would choose to volunteer its testimony.
However, it seems to the above committees the course of prudence
to be prepared for all contingencies. Accordingly, we propose that
MCA engage prof. Steven Lustgarten of Baruch college as a consultant
to assemble and organise data demonstrating that the chemical indus­
try is not in need of deconcentration under Senator Hart's proposed
"Industrial Reorganisation Act" - that it is, in fact, highly com­
petitive, open to new entrants, and a force restraining rather than
sustaining inflation (the detailed proposal of Prof. Lustgarten is
appended).
The proposal is budgeted for a cost of $17,637. This figure
does not include the cost of printing.
The decision whether to
print the study and in what form is a separate question, to be
decided when it is completed.

Ui6.6'5
PRESIDENT NIXON...
...in his State of the Union message, emphasised the Admin­
istration's legislative proposals which were introduced last
year and on which congressional action has not yet been com­
pleted.
Specifically, the President urged the Congress to
take early action on welfare reform, health services, revenue
sharing, the environment, consumer protection and transporta­
tion.
In addition to stressing the need for action on proposed en­
vironmental legislation, the President stated he would soon be
sending to the Congress a message on the environment that would
present "further administrative and legislative initiatives."
The President also indicated that he would soon propose new legis-*
lation concerning:
A new technology program, with federal
increase private research, and
incentives to
Federally supported research on a range of projects
designed "to improve our everyday lives."
Another area involving new legislative proposals concerns edu­
cation.
The President stated he would recommend later in the
year a new way of financing public schools to supplant reliance
on local property taxes.
While no details were given, it is under­
stood the Administration has been studying the concept of a valueadded tax as a means of raising revenue to pay for local schools.
However, passage of such legislation this year is improbable.
THE 92ND CONGRESS...
...reconvened on January 18 to start what leaders in both
houses hope will be an abbreviated Second Session.
Sights are
set on adjournment by Labor Day.
In the environmental area two measures undoubtedly will be
enacted: water pollution and pesticides control.
The water bill, S. 2770, passed the Senate in November.
Its
House counterpart has been approved in principle by the Public
Works Committee, and passage by April is likely.
The pesticide bill, H.R. 10729, passed the House last November.
Consideration by the Senate Agriculture Committee has not yet been
scheduled, but probably will be in the next month or so.
Enact­
ment in about six months is possible.
CMA 036161
Toxic substances legislation, which is under consideration
by the Senate Subcommittee on the Environment under the acting
likely to be approved this year even though a draft has been
prepared by committee staff and is said to be ready for executive
session consideration.
We have, however, complied with the request made by Senator
Spong during our testimony last November 5.
In a letter dated
January 5, our views were transmitted concerning these aspects
of Amendment No. 338. in which we questioned both:
The adequacy and usefulness of the definition of
"chemical substances," as stated in Section 202, and
The potential value of a "provisional certification
subject to recall" as a means of shortening the ad­
ministrative delays incident to full certification.
In the consumer protection area, at least two measures probably
will become law:
S. 986, the Consumer Product Warranties and Federal Trade Com­
mission Improvement Act of 1971.
It passed the Senate in November
and should get through the House within the next few months.
And,
H.R. 10835, the Consumer Protection Act of 1971, which passed
the House in October.
This bill would create an independent Con­
sumer Protection Agency, and is expected to pass the Senate,
possibly in a more stringent form than the House version.
There is less chance of completed action on product safety
legislation, although a House Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Subcommittee is currently conducting hearings on H.R. 8110, a
product safety bill.
In the labor area, the first order of business is Senate
consideration of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
Floor debate began on January 19 and
action was expected to be completed by the end of the month.
A House measure concerning this subject passed that body in
September.
In that version, H.R. 9247, EEOC would have to
request court action to enforce "cease-and-desist" orders.
Under the Senate bill, as reported by the Senate Labor and
Public Welfare Committee, EEOC would have "cease-and-desist"
powers.
Minimum wage 1 egisi ation is likely to be enacted this
session.
H.R. 7130, reported by the House Education and Labor
Committee in November, would boost the minimum wage to $2 an
hour.
The Senate Labor Subcommittee has under consideration
S. 1861 which would raise the minimum wage to $2 an hour the
year of enactment, and $2.25 one year later.

Emergency strike legislation is a hot issue due to the West
Coast dock strike.
On January 21 . President Nixon submitted a
message to the Congress requesting legislation to halt it, and
a bill was introduced by Senators Bob Packwood (R.-Ore.) and
Jacob Javits (R.-N.Y.) as Senate Joint Resolution 187.
The
full Senate Labor Committee began hearings on January 27 and
was expected to complete consideration of the proposal within
a week.
The measure would provide for the appointment of a 3-man
Arbitration Board to hear and settle the issues.
No strike or
lockout would be permitted from the date the legislation was
enacted until the day the Arbitration Board makes its deter­
mination.
The Board's determination would be made within 40
days and would be binding on all parties for 18 months.
The President also requested enactment of the emergency Public
Interest Protection Act of 1971 (S. 560 and H.R. 3596), which
would provide permanent authority to settle strikes in the trans­
portation industry.
f
While limited legislation to stop the West Coast dock strike
may be passed, it will be extremely difficult to get permanent
anti-strike legislation through in an election year.
Trade legislation was significantly omitted from the President's
State of the Union message.
It appears the Administration omitted
the issue in order to avoid providing a forum for consideration of
the Hartke-Burke bill or. other protectionist or restrictive trade
proposals.
In view of the broad scope of the Hartke-Burke measure
(S. 2592/H.R. 10914), it is receiving the attention of several MCA
committees--Economic Policy Review, Tax Policy, International
Trade and Government Relations.
The latter committee held a meet­
ing on January 27 to discuss the various courses of action which
might be taken by MCA should this proposal come up for congression­
al hearings.
Also, the Senate Commerce Committee has under consideration
the Export Expansion Act of 1971, S. 2754, on which the Adminis­
tration has not expressed a position.
Public hearings were
held by the Committee's Subcommittee on Foreign Commerce and
Tourism during the week of January 24.
More are scheduled later
in February.
Our International Trade Committee recommends that
written\testimony be submitted.
A proposed draft is in preparatior.o#hich will echo positions we have previously taken with
regard to expanding exports.
THE ECONOMIC POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEE...
CMA036163
...which you recently established, held its first meeting on
January 18 and considered matters relating to Phase II economic
policy and to the economic incentives for research and development
proposed by President Nixon in his State of the Union message.
The committee is chaired by William S. Sneath, President of
Union Carbide Corporation.
David C. Williams is serving as MCA
Staff Secretary.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA).. .
...will conduct hearings on proposed emission standards
concerning mercury, asbestos and beryllium as hazardous air
pollutants as follows:
New York, New York
January 18
Kansas City, Missouri
February 1
Los Angeles, California
February 15
In accordance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970,
EPA's Administrator:
Is authorized to set emission standards for existing sources
of air contaminants which he finds to be hazardous, and
Can delay construction of a new emissions source for such
air pollutants until he first determines that the new source,,
if properly operated, will not violate his standards.
MCA is not participating in the above hearings.
However,
several member companies which produce chlorine and caustic by
the mercury cell process are active through the Chlorine
Institute.
Last December 23, standards of performance for atmospheric
-emissions from new or substantially modified sulfuric and nitric
acid plants were promulgated by EPA, together with those for
fixed steam generators, Portland cement plants, and municipaltype incinerators.
We submitted carefully documented comments
on the proposed standards following their publication last
August 17.
However, the final version took little cognizance
of the economic and technological factors we presented.
As a result, nine sulfuric acid producers, representing ap­
proximately 60% of the industry's production capacity, have
joined to seek judicial review of the standards for sulfuric
acid plants.
MCA is not involved.
EPA has announced its intention to propose Federal standards
of performance for atmospheric emissions from petrochemical
processes at an early date, and has invited the Association to
nominate industry representatives to an informal advisory grouD
to supplement the technical expertise of the EPA staff.
In
spite of limited success in previous efforts, we feel we should
continue to cooperate, and we thank our members for volunteering
their experts to serve on such advisory bodies.
EPA is soon expected to publish proposed regulations govern­
ing control of hazardous substances in relation to water quality
control, which have long been in preparation.
We are seeking an
opportunity for our technical specialists to cooperate in pre­
publication review of the proposal.

CHEMTREC...
...the Chemical Emergency Transportation Center, has received
over 2000 inbound call's since its inception September 5, 1971.
Some 200 calls concerned incidents involving chemicals in transit.
Many were made simply to confirm CHEMTREC's existence.
A signi­
ficant but dwindling number of calls resulted from the telephone
company having assigned CHEMTREC the discontinued reservation
number of the Howard Johnson motel chain.
Assistance has been provided in situations ranging from major
train derailments to leaks in small packages.
Tank cars and
drums have been the containers involved in about two-thirds of
the incidents reported.
Two problems involving ships in storms
in the Pacific Ocean have been successfully handled and one call
was from Alaska.
During CHEMTREC planning, it was anticipated that calls from
emergency services (fire, police) would predominate.
So far,
however, carriers are far ahead in making use of the service.
Hopefully, this will dispose of many problems before they need
emergency attention. •
Operating experience to date confirms the validity of the
chosen approach -- providing immediate information from file;
then utilizing the expertise of shippers.
f
Reaction to CHEMTREC has been good from carriers and emer­
gency services alike.
Prompt company follow-up has been an im­
portant factor in this achievement and cooperation by member
companies generally as well as many non-members has been excel­
lent.
During the week of March 6, several workshops on CHEMTREC
will be conducted by its Manager, John C-. Zercher, in Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Portland and Seattle.
Target audiences are: fire,
police and other emergency personnel plus non-member chemical
companies.
West Coast assistance is by the Southern California
Chemical Manufacturers Association and the Chemical Industry
Councils of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest.
PHTHALATES...
...particularly phthalate esters used as plasticizers for
plastics, mainly polyvinyl chloride, have been the subject of
f--a number of news items over the past year calling attention
‘to potential health and ecological consequences from their
widespread use.

As yet there have been no allegations of harm to human health.
However, researchers are concerned about finding these substances
in the heart muscle of various animals, extraction by the blood
in hospital containers and effects observed in experimental
animals.

ference among technical representatives of interested companies,

STAFF PROPOSAL
concerning
Air Quality Committee Membership
of
Donald C. Winson
On February 10, 1970, at the request of the Air
Quality Committee, the Board of Directors approved
regularization of the membership of Donald C. winson
on this committee.
Mr. Winson, an outside counsel
representing Alcoa, was recognized as a valid exception to the "General Principles Applicable to the
Structure and Operations of Committees" provision
that membership be restricted to full-time employees
of member companies.
This action was made subject
to annual staff review and Board reconfirmation, and
on February 9, 1971, such reconfirmation was granted
by the Board.
As the factors leading to the earlier request
remain equally valid, the staff recommends the Board
approve Mr. Winson's continuation as a member of the
Air Quality Committee, subject to staff review and
Board reconfirmation at the end of another year.
Staff Proposal of February 10,
1970, is attached
for information.

STAFF PROPOSAL
concerning
Air Quality Committee Membership
of
Donald C. Winson
Frank L. Seamans, outside counsel of the Aluminum Company
of America, was on the charter roster of the Air Quality Committee
when it was organized in 1949, and was an outstanding contributor
to its program in the early years. Upon adoption of the "General
Principles Applicable to the Structure and Operations of Committees"
in 1963, on his own initiative he inquired whether the requirement
of "member-company full-time employee" for committee membership
would affect his status. General Hull, then MCA president, rul d
that this pre-existing menibership could continue undisturbed.
In 1964, Alcoa nominated Donald Cl Winson, a member of Mr.
Seamans' legal firm, as successor to Mr. Seamans. The record of
Board approval indicates only that Mr. Winson represents Alcoa,
with no evidence of recognition that he was not an Alcoa employee.
The irregularity of his membership was brought out in a recent
general review of committees by Staff Counsel.
The Air Quality Committee is eager for Mr. Winson to con­
tinue in full participation. His background of legal specializa­
tion in industrial air pollution is comparatively rare, and his
leadership at this juncture is especially valuable. He has been,
and is personally interested in continuing to be, an active con­
tributor to the Committee's needs. He can be particularly helpful
in the organization and development of the recently authorized
Joint Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution Legislation and
Regulations.
Accordingly, primarily as a "grandfather" case and as such
not otherwise setting a precedent, and secondarily in recognition
of continuing need by the Committee for the services he is pecu­
liarly able to render, the staff recommends that the Board of
Directors regularize the membership of Donald C. Winson on the
Air Quality Committee as an acknowledged exception to the membercompany full-time employee qualification, subject to staff review
and Board reconfirmation annually.

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
BAILEY BARTON, CHAIRMAN
AIR QUALITY COMMITTEE
APRIL 13,
1976
It is a pleasure to be here today to report on the Air Quality
Committee's activities.
Since my last presentation, in February,
1975, we have, I believe, made some substantial contributions to
the interests of the Manufacturing Chemists Association.
I would be remiss, however, if I characterized our efforts
as being successful in meeting our objectives.
You may recall that
I described 1975 as the "year of opportunity" for amending the Clean
Air Act in a positive way.
It is true that the activity of Congress
in Clean Air Legislation served to restrain the fervor of the EPA in
enforcing 1975 deadlines of the Clean Alp Act—as did a few court
cases—but the legislation actually emerging from Congressional Com­
mittees offers precious little prospect of making the Act more rea­
sonable.
It appears, in fact, that our environmentalist friends also
saw 1975 as a "year of opportunity" and seized the initiative in in­
fluencing even more stringent provisions than previously existed.
Industry may, for example, petition extension from the previous dead­
lines, but must meet rigid criteria, waive some of its rights, and be
prepared to either post performance bonds or actually pay penalties
for the delay.
Most critical, however, are the provisions of both
House and Senate defining "antidegradation" or "significant deteri­
oration" in arbitrary numerical or percentage terms.
These provi­
sions, coupled with another "planning" process, cannot avoid a
substantial and inevitable confrontation with industrial growth and
development.
Undoubtedly, you are already aware of these and other extra­
polations of these amendments, so I won't belabor the issues.
Our
Committee prepared, and MCA submitted, several commentaries and
position papers to Congress on these amendments—as have many trade
associations.
Some concessions have been obtained—but the only
positive report I can make, today, is that these amendments are not
yet law.
Until they become so, I pledge the Air Quality Committ
1s
continued diligence in attempting to bring about constructive leg­
islation.
CMA 036912
l

We have also been very active in Environmental Protection Ag ncy
r gulatory proceedings.
The two areas which were cited last year are
still the "hot" ones.
EPA, with one notable exception, has elected to j
employ Section III to regulate emissions of substances which the Admin- >
istrator may reasonably believe constitute^ a hazard.
The exception,
of course, is the Agency's choice of Section 112—the imminent hazard
provision—to propose vinyl chloride monomer limitations.
The Agency
1
has found that regulation of such emissions as sulfuric acid mist using .
Section III requires far leas substantiation than a new ambient air
quality standard.
Moreover, EPA prefers the equipment efficiency
approach—best practicable treatment, if you will—fthich this section
provides.
We believe our Committee's careful scrutiny of these regu­
lations, and the propensity of individual company members to litigate
the issues they challenge, have served to reduce the rate of promulga­
tion of such regulations.
We expect to continue following Agency action
from inception to promulgation on the multitude of materials waiting—
In this way, we believe MCA member compa- •
nies will profit by both technical input and up-to-date communication
of impending problems.
The second area I mentioned last year has a special significance.
The hydrocarbon-photochemical oxidant issue—embryonic last February—
has reached full flower as a published policy of EPA.
You may r call
that the Agency has concluded that all hydrocarbon emissions are ulti­
mately oxidant—or smog—forming compounds and must be controlled.
They are pressuring the states to tighten-up hydrocarbon emission lim­
its in the hypothetical hope of meeting ambient air oxidant standards.
This is being manifest in storage tank vapor control.requirements,
revision of the former "Rule 66" photochemically-reactive compound
limits to reflect broader "volatile organic,” and, generally, in the
transportation control strategy approach.
Major impact of this shift in EPA policy is being felt by our
industry in the State of Texas where hydrocarbon controls are being
thrust upon them by EPA's infamous Region VI.
In an effort to head
off the potentially large expenditures thus required, the MCA-affil­
iate Texas Chemical Council has requested our assistance.
Locally,
th y have been joined by the Houston Chamber of Commerce and possess
the indirect support of the Texas Air Quality Board staff.
Through
its own channels, the American Petroleum Institute is pursuing a
parallel course of opposition to EPA's hypothesis.

In a November, 1975 presentation to top MCA staff and Air
Quality Committee officers, TCC leadership provided the outlines
of a four-point program.
The more-detailed technical plans were
presented to the full Air Quality Committee in January, 1976 in
Houston, Texas—where we had shifted our meeting for the purpose.
Our Committee sought out portions of the TCC program in which we
could best serve all member companies.
We are preparing endeavors
to obtain emission control cost data from member companies and
definitive information on hydrocarbon-oxidant relationships in
several cities.
Specific proposals for Board authorization of
funding should be completed shortly and, in our view, they repre­
sent substantive support to the Texas Chemical Council's request
for help.
This is also a primary result of our Committee's rather
difficult task' of negotiating a veritable maze of alternative
approaches to this very complex question.
In a related develop­
ment, EPA has invited MCA AQC participation in a Reactivity
Task Group which we expect will provide another avenue to explor­
ing the uncertainties of supporting data in the near future.
I am aware that it has been over a year since I told you that
$100,000 was a reasonable sum to budget for this effort—and I am
grateful that you chose to budget half-that, $50,000, even though
we have not until now, offered a specific recommendation for its
expenditure.
The data base which supports EPA's contentions has
so many uncertainties that we have deemed it necessary to explore
numerous possible avenues before focusing on the one which we
,believe to be most productive in terms of value received for money
spent.
I appreciate your patience in this matter and believe that
our Committee's deliberations since TCC's first request in November
will reward their patience as well.
I won't belabor the other Com­
mittee and intercommittee activities which are underway.
The fore­
going have occupied most of the AQC's recent attention and are
exemplary.
Turning to another area, of Committee Activity—one to which
the Board responded to a concern expressed by all environmental
committee officers last year—we very much appreciate the guidance
offered by Dr. Taufen's committee in resolving MCA Staff and tech­
nical committee relationship problems.
Clair, Mr. Anderson, and Dr. Barnes were very sensitive to the
CMA 036914
4
questions and comments which arose in our several sessions, and
encouraged initiation of communications sessions which have taken
us far down the road of enlightenment.
This, I hope, will continue
since it serves both the Committees and the MCA staff—and, ulti­
mately, the membership of MCA.
Additionally, I would personally
recommend periodic, detailed review by a Board committee to insure
expeditious resolution of staff/Comnittee conflicts.
I must mention two remaining problem areas which I view as
chronic.
First, the delicate statutory and regulatory aspects of
our work require—indeed they demand—a unique technical—legal
partnership to maximize effectiveness.
We engineers tend to over­
look legal subtleties in calculating the true effects of governmen­
tal proposals, so we need to rehearse our thoughts in concert with
detail-minded working lawyers.
The Legal Advisory Committee has
addressed this issue and has offered constructive recommendations.
However, translation of the abstract into the concrete has been
difficult to consummate.
The Air Quality Committee could be more
effective if we had a participating attorney in our meetings and
statutory/regulatory reviews.
I bring another unresolved—or perhaps I should say, "Tem­
porarily" resolved—problem to your attention today because I view
it as a chronic and strength-sapping enigma.
For most of 1975 we
had four nominees and no place for them.
The by-laws say for us
to rotate off members when this situation exists--but every plan
* offered was rejected by the full committee.
Finally, the officers
chose, in the face of indignation, rebuke and even a threatened
lawsuit, to rotate off four lax attendees and seat the nominees,
but much valuable meeting time had been lost in the debate.
In
my view, our recent solution will only last until the next nominee
comes along.
I will close my oral remarks by looking ahead to future endeavors
^for a few moments.
I see the Air Quality Committee's attention phasing
from the old "nuts and bolts" control aspect into the more exotic
health effects arena.
This will require a broader, much more sophis­
ticated data base, and perhaps more health oriented personnel to make
meaningful contributions to Association interests.
I also envision
a Committee/staff necessity to do much more extensive image building—
or more properly—image repairing to counter the chemicals = cancer

psychology.
Somehow we must convince Congress of our value.
And
most importantly, i believe we are all a part of a fundamental
struggle to keep free enterprise a viable concept in today's hostile
climate.
You gentlemen, our
leaders, our mentors, and our sage ad­
visors, hold the key to whether my generation will take the reins of
our great American corporations or be relegated to civil servants in

Exhibit E
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
DENNIS P. BRIDGE, CHAIRMAN
SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
APRIL 13, 1976
The primary Solid Wastes Management Committee (SWMC) concern
is for legislative proposals for so-called "Hazardous Waste
Materials".
For the last several years the SWMC reports have
indicated legislative activity during the previous year and the
expectation of restrictive legislation the following year. Al­
though I am pleased to say that these forebodings have not come
to pass, I quickly note that the current situation is quite
similar to that of past years — legislation may well be passed
during this elect'ion year.
The first significant act dealing
with solid waste was passed in 1965 and the second legislative
action followed in 1970.
During 1975 there was legislative
activity in this area and, assuming five years to be a reasonable
gestation period, 1976 could be the year.
This legislation will
not be as far reaching as that being proposed for toxic substances,
but it will significantly impact chemical process industry (CPI)
operations.
Since the last SWMC report to the Board, there have been
nine major legislative proposals, either actual bills or working
"drafts, concerning solid waste.
Of these the Senate Public Works
Committee Bill S. 2150 sponsored by Senator Jennings Randolph
and the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, Sub­
committee on Transportation and Commerce working draft as sponsored
by Congressman Rooney, are the two most likely candidates for
enactment.
The Administration has not sponsored a bill but has
indicated general support of S. 2150. We expect that each
proposal will reach its respective floor in May.
Although with some undesirable provisions. Senator Randolph's
bill is certainly the more acceptable of the two proposals.
Both
documents contain "Hazardous Waste" sections, but S. 2150 is much
less complicated and it does not require federal approval for all
permits for waste transport, treatment and storage, but rather
concentrates on state implementation of a permit system similar
to current air and water requirements.
The Rooney proposal
requires permits at both levels.
In addition it addresses several
CMA 036917
1
i
i
i
areas not included in S. 2150 such as product and container control
as a means of source waste reduction and tax incentives for recycling. We believe that the Rooney working draft will be modified
to resemble the Senate Public Works proposal.
Whatever the final form of the legislation, MCA will strongly
espouse the concept of performance requirements for waste disposal
rather than the predetermination or specification approach currently
being fostered. Waste should be deemed hazardous only after its
toxicity, quantity and disposal site have been carefully considered.
Predetermination of a waste disposal method without investigating
each of these parameters is counterproductive because this restricts
development of new technology and precludes the use of viable
alternatives appropriate to specific geographical areas or to
available equipment. MCA will contend that the authority over
the areas of packaging, transportation and storage of waste
materials continue to be vested in the U.S. Department of Trans­
portation.
Should adoption of a permit system be unavoidable,
we will advocate that the disposal site rather than the generator
be the permittee and that state implementation of the permit
system under federal guidelines is preferred over direct federal
intervention.
Finally, to provide for reasonable regulatory
requirements from both a technical and economic viewpoint, we
will strive for sufficient time constraints and flexibility in
any legislation to accommodate the dearth of technology and disposal cost data currently available to us.
Many of the states, most notably Texas and California, have
, passed solid waste management legislation dealing with hazardous
wastes.
Because this legislation has preceded federal hazardous
waste disposal activity, it is quite likely that the EPA may
adopt those concepts fostered by these states which have proven
to be most workable.
SWMC monitors "Bellwether" states for
concepts which might be incorporated into federal regulations.
In addition liaison is being maintained with the National Solid
Waste Management Association (NSWMA) to monitor its efforts to
develop a legislative guide for use by each state.
Ai
1
SWMC legislative activity is directed almost solely to
disposal of hazardous wastes.
Chemical packaging has not been
raised as an issue to date.
Should this occur, SWMC will ask the
Chemical Packaging Committee's assistance on this matter which
is of vital importance to the CPI from a marketing as well as
disposal viewpoint.
tl
CMA 036918
A secondary but very important SWMC concern is meaningful
liaison with the EPA.
Solid waste control is unique among environ­
mental concerns because the EPA has had a relatively long lead
time to perform research and gather data to establish regulations
on a more scientific basis while still complying with the stringent
time frame expected in the enabling legislation,
SWMC feels it important, especially in view of EPA's intent,
to present MCA positions at every opportunity.
During the past
year there have been three salient examples of SWMC work with EPA:
First, during our May 20-21, 1975 meeting, EPA's Office
of Solid Waste Management Programs (OSWMP) representatives
made a presentation on an EPA $5.4 million landfill project
being conducted with the state of Minnesota.
This project
is intended to determine the effectiveness of modern land­
fill design and operational techniques.
Several member
companies are following this work closely.
Second, on
December 4, 1975, at one of four EPA public meetings on
hazardous waste, the Chairman of SWMC presented comprehensive
testimony on behalf of MCA in response to a formal EPA
request for such information.
The EPA is now developing
synopses of the various comments as a basis for its position
on legislation and on subsequent regulations.
Finally, a
meeting was held with personnel from the EPA's Solid and
Hazardous Waste Research Division, Municipal Environmental
Research Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio in conjunction with
a regular SWMC meeting.
SWMC members have repeatedly
expressed a desire to investigate the possibilities of
contracting research work to fill existing data gaps in the
area of landfill disposal of potentially hazardous wastes.
To avoid duplication it is important that we ascertain the
scope of EPA research activities. The EPA presentation and
suggestions were well received and very beneficial in
guiding us toward an appropriate research activity, to be
identified by our Technical Subcommittee.
A compendium of 15 successful case histories of waste
recycling or residua disposal is being developed by the Technical
Subcommittee. This document will provide positive CPI input to
various legislative and regulatory proposals with respect to the
significant amount of current work within industry on disposal of
potentially hazardous wastes.
A joint subcommittee, composed of representatives of the
SWMC and Water Resources Committee, was formed in 1974 to develop
guidelines for deep-well disposal.
This document has just been
published.
CMA 036919
The concept of land use regulation continues to disturb
SWMC members and representatives of the other environmental
committees.
Land use legislation could be the most insidious
tool available to those who would punitively regulate the CPI.
Forms of land use regulation are currently embodied in federal
air, water and coastal zone management legislation, and several
land use proposals have been made relative to solid waste dis­
posal. As a result of the total environmer.tal implications of
this issue the Task Group on Land Use, consisting of two repre­
sentatives from each of the three environmental committees, was
established at the SWMC's request.
The group is to review the
question of land use with respect to possible implications on
CPI operations and to make appropriate recommendations to the
MCA Board for action.
During its organizational meeting the
Group concluded that, prior to developing recommendations for
MCA Board action, there is a definite need to ascertain current
CPI status with respect to all existing federal and regional
land use legislation.
Because of the legal nature of the activity,
MCA staff through the Joint Subcommittee on Environmental Law
(JSEL) or other legal source has been formally requested to
develop this information for the Task Group by July 1, 1976.
The Task Group will then develop its recommendations to MCA
by September, 1976.
The question of JSEL continuation, under review by the
Legal Advisory Committee for some time, has reportedly been
resolved in that JSEL will remain intact and function in a
manner yet to be defined. We have been assured by MCA staff
that legal assistance will be available upon request.
At
present at least two formal requests have been made to JSEL by
SWMC seeking legal assistance.
These include upcoming proposals
on solid waste legislation and the land use issue,
in order to
properly address these important issues it is imperative that
legal as well as technical expertise be readily available.
To
date, in keeping with past JSEL performance, we have not received
indication that consideration of our requests has been initiated.
If we are to effectively influence and combat unacceptable legis­
lative proposals, adequate legal assistance is a must.
With the exception of the JSEL question, some progress has
been made in improving internal MCA communications and organiza­
tional difficulties which were highlighted in the previous
two SWMC reports. As per recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee
on Environmental Affairs, two meetings have been held between
environmental committee chairmen and various MCA staff to discuss
MCA administrative procedures and methods by which MCA can act
in a more unified and timely fashion.
As a result of these
meetings several measures have been recommended to foster
improvement.
One of these provides for Government Relations
Department input into environmental committee meetings on a
continuing basis.
A member of the Government Relations staff
has been assigned to work with SWMC in liaison capacity.
This
in addition to the consistent and competent efforts of our
current Staff Secretary should be beneficial to SWMC activities.
To insure that a continuing dialogue is maintained among
all facets of MCA environmental affairs, I recommend that a
meeting of environmental committee members and appropriate MCA
staff be held annually to provide a forum for exchange and
coordination of information from all relevant sources, review
of MCA administration procedures and resolution of issues
involving more than one of the environmental committees.
In conclusion, SWMC is concerned with the ultimate disposal
of potentially hazardous wastes.
Of all the areas of environ­
mental control, ultimate disposal most readily reflects the need
for a total environmental control approach. We may see sig­
nificant successes in air and water pollution abatement processes.
But what has the CPI really accomplished if these successes are ~
negated because we are unable to dispose of the abatement process
residues or other potentially hazardous wastes in a technically
and economically feasible manner? We believe that, if the legal,
governmental and technical expertise which should be available
to us through MCA auspices can be combined into timely action,
we need not be the weak link in the chain of total environmental
control.

REPORT BY THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
WILLIAM M
STOVER
MAY 11, 1976
SENATE COMMITTEE WORKING ON TAX LEGISLATION
The Senate Finance Committee began markup of tax reform/tax
reduction legislation on April 27 and is expected to report some
type of tax measure by mid-June. Although it is not clear just
what the scope of the Committee's action will be, it is entirely '
possible that their bill will simply extend tax reduction pro­
visions which expire on June 30, thus delaying action on a tax
reform package until later in the year. Senator Russell Long,
Chairman of the Finance Conxnittee, has indicated that such a
course is a distinct possibility.
During the past two weeks of markup sessions the Senate
committee dealt primarily with tax shelters of little direct
interest to the chemical industry.
It is significant to note,
however, that most decisions could be characterized as easing
off on limitations or restrictions included in the House-passed
tax reform bill (H.R. 10612), Many observers are concluding
therefore that when the Conmictee takes up capital formation
and foreign income provisions, its actions will be generally
more favorable to industry than chat of the House.
However, there is still danger ahead. Whenever a tax bill
comes up for Senate floor action -- be it a simple extension of
expiring tax reduction provisions or a comprehensive tax reform/
tax reduction package -- Senator Kennedy and several other reformminded Senators are expected to introduce a number of anti-business
amendments. These are likely to include proposals to repeal de­
ferral of taxation of income of foreign subsidiaries, restrict
the use of the foreign tax credit, eliminate DISC entirely, repeal
the Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) System, and repeal the percen­
tage depletion allowance for hard minerals.
CMA 036987
The fate of these extreme amendments will depend on the
ability of the business community to convince a majority of
Senators of the damaging impact of the proposals on U. S.
business and the general economy.
This was emphasized yesterday by U. S. Senator Herman E.
Talmadge of Georgia, second-ranking Democrat on the Senate
Finance Committee.
In addressing MCA's CHEMICAL FORUM he urged
company officials to communicate their views on tax changes to
all Senators, and especially to those on the Finance Committee.
In order to stimulate savings and capital investment, Senator
Talmadge indicated that he favored proposals recommended by the
Administration and supported by MCA to make the 107. investment
tax credit permanent, to reduce the corporate tax rate, eliminate
double taxation of corporate profits and to modify the present
method of taxing capital gains. He fully supports retention of
the Foreign Tax Credit and DISC and firmly opposes any changes
that would materially alter and burden the competitive position
of our companies operating abroad.
It is his opinion that many
Members of the Finance Committee shared his views on these matters.
Various business organizations are urging industry spokesmen
to contact all Senators with whom they have constituent relations
to make known their views on these issues. We certainly support
this line of action, and believe that such contacts should be
made before June 15.
CLEAN AIR AMENDMENTS HIT SNAG IN SENATE
The Public Works Committees of both the House and Senate have
reported bills in what is the first attempt at comprehensive re­
vision of the Clean Air Act of 1970 (PL 91-604).
An emotional struggle is under way over provisions contained
in both bills intended to protect clean air against "significant
deterioration".
Both bills establish certain "mandatory" Class I
areas where only small amounts of additional pollution would be
allowed. The Committees say their non-deterioration proposals
would give states more control over the classification process
than do the EPA's present regulations.
Industry views this approach
as thinly disguised Federal land-use control.
CMA 036988

In the Senate, there are signs that support is growing for an
amendment proposed by Senator Frank Moss (D -Utah),
The Democratic
leadership has recently postponed until early June the floor de­
bate on Senator Muskie's bill, S
3219.
The Moss amendment would
defer the new nondeterioration restrictions for one year. During
that period, a National Commission on Air Quality, established in
the Senate bill, studies the economic and energy impacts of the
proposal and considers whether the government has enough technical
information to implement it
By late April, Senator Moss had gathered 12 co-sponsors -six Republicans and six Democrats. The hasty decision to postpone
floor action is being interpreted as an indication that his pro­
posal now has the backing to be adopted, and that opponents need
more time to solidify their opposition, MCA is therefore con­
tinuing to work to build support for the Moss amendment. We are
urging that member companies communicate with Senators on this
subject as soon as possible,
The House Interstate

THE SOLID WASTE UTILIZATION ACT -- WILL IT PASS7
The Senate Public Works Committee has scheduled markup on
proposed solid waste utilization legislation for May 12 and 13.
Last July, Committee Chairman Senator Jennings Randolph (D.-W,Va.)
introduced S, 2150, resulting from extensive hearings held during
1975.
Last Monday, May 10, the Committee staff issued a new
working print of the bill, which will now become the basis for
the markup.
The Hous* Interstate and Foreign Commerce Subcommittee on
Transportation and Commerce issued a draft solid waste bill last
December which was considerably more comprehensive than the orig­
inal Senate bill. We now understand that the Subcommittee has
abandoned the first draft because of adverse reactions, and that
another draft will emerge in mid-May which will be less contro­
versial and more likely to attract wide support. The Subcommittee
expects to hold hearings following issuance of the new draft bill.
CMA 036989
Last summer we submitted our own marked-up version of S. 2150
to the Senate Public Works Committee. We did the same with the
House Transportation and Commerce Subcommittee December draft.
In related developments, a House Government Operations Sub­
committee has conducted oversight hearings on solid waste, and
a House Science and Technology Subcommittee has held hearings on
several research and development bills related to solid waste and
resource recovery issues.
Oversight recommendations and R&D
legislative proposals will be given consideration and possible
incorporation by the Subcommittee on Transportation and Commerce
in its writing of the major House solid waste bill.
Judging from the events discussed above, and the general con­
sensus on Capitol Hill, there appears to be a good possibility of
new solid waste legislation this year.
OSHA OVERSIGHT HEARINGS
Hearings on worker exposure to toxic materials are scheduled
in the House Government Operations Manpower Subcomnittee this
Tuesday and Wednesday, May 11 and 12, and continuing May 19.
The Subcommittee plans to investigate the adequacy of OSHA
health standards, whether the procurement systems of GSA and DOD
include screening for toxic substances and subsequent worker noti­
fication, and whether dangerous chemicals in the workplace may be
more widespread than generally recognized.
Witnesses scheduled for Tuesday, May 11, include representa­
tives of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,
and OCAW (Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union). On May 12 the
Subcomnittee will hear Dr. Morton Corn, Assistant Secretary of Labor
for OSHA. Also appearing will be a spokesman for MCA, Mr. Emil E.
Christofano, Chairman of the MCA Occupational Health Committee.
Mr. Christofano is an Industrial Hygienist for Hercules Incorporated.

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
FOOD.
GARY A. SUNSHINE. CHAIRMAN
DRUG, AND COSMETIC CHEMICALS COMMITTEE
MAY 11,
1976
It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to report to you
on the activities of the FDCC Committee and to share with you
thoughts that have grown out of my association with the work of
the Committee during the past year.
As you know, the objectives and the function of the FDCC
Committee are as follows:
"To advise thp Board of Directors concerning
chemicals used in foods, drugs, and cosmetics, and in
accord with Association policies and procedures,
develop positions on legislation and regulations affect­
ing such chemicals, formulate principles and encourage
technical development pertinent to their use and
cooperate with other organizations having parallel
interests
Considering the rapid rate of developments in the past few
years, these responsibilities represent no small task.
The activities
of the Committee during the past year have been directed largely
toward consolidating and implementing organizational improvements
initiated during the preceding year.
The organizational structure
that has been established consists essentially of a legislative and
regulatory subcommittee, a scientific subcommittee, and a commun­
ications subcommittee, which are designed to closely follow develop­
ments in their respective areas.
The subcommittees, through their
respective chairmen, and the steering subcommittee, function by
developing and referring well-developed reports and proposals to
the full Committee for review and action.
This structural concept
takes advantage of the available manpower by establishing a welldefined division of the work areas; eliminating repetitious meetings,
and concentrating on developing concrete proposals for the basis
of Committee action.
Task force units with specific areas of assign­
ment within these broad lines of division have also been used to
advantage.
CMA 036991
During the past year, for example, the Committee prepared
and submitted extensive comments on the FDA proposed Administrative
Practices and Procedures regulations,
of particular importance to
MCA was the FDA position stated in Section 2.23 (b) of these proposed
regulations, that any representation made by a trade association
"shall be on behalf of its members and shall constitute a represen­
tation on behalf of each member of the trade association, except
those specifically excluded by name in any such submission."
The
obstacles to equitable administration of justice under the law
that could be evoked by such a provision are so numerous as to preclude
detailed reference in this report.
Such objections have been fully
documented in our submission to FDA.
Other features of the proposed
regulations to which we have submitted substantial comments have
included a proposed limitation on the opportunity to present oral
testimony and to cross-examine witnesses during hearings, and the
establishment of criteria which the FDA asserted constituted a
proper basis on which to deny a petition or right to a hearing.
These provisions and others of varying degrees of importance and
impact are not merely a codification of existing FDA procedures, but
in many respects, represent a basic change in practices that restrict'
the rights of individuals subject to the agency's jurisdiction to
obtain consideration and review.
Another legislative development of importance which is now
under review by the legislative and regulatory subcommittee is the
Kennedy Food Surveillance Bill S.641.
Although originally heralded
as applying primarily to food manufacturing and processing establish­
ments, this proposed legislation has implications extending beyond
these areas.
Under the manufacturing sections, surveillance features
are included relating to the establishment of safety assurance pro­
cedures within plants, product coding, record keeping, and inspections.
In addition the Bill contains provisions for requiring registration
of food establishments.
However, in a broader context, the Bill
imposes obligations on food processors to immediately notify the
institution of a recall as well as the possibility that processed
foods "may be adulterated."
Citizens civil actions also are authorrized under the Bill.
Additionally, the Bill contains extensive
new requirements pertaining to the label identification of all
ingredients.
in addition to these activities, the Committee has also
monitored the NCI Carcinogenic Bioassay program, the FCC and FAO/WHO
monographs for food chemicals, and the FDA review of GRAS substances.
CMA 036992
These activities have been carried out primarily under the program
of the scientific subcommittee together with a number of other
projects relating to technical developments in the area of food,
drug, and cosmetic chemicals,
The development of proposed Good
Manufacturing Practices Guidelines for bulk drugs and food chemicals
is presently under study by this subcommittee.
In addition, technical
liaison is carried out with the activities of PMA, as they relate
to bulk drugs and with GMA, as they relate to food chemicals.
A project presently active within the communications sub­
committee is the development of a proposal for the formation of a
chemical industry information center.
Although the details of the
organization and operation of such a center and various considerations
relating to its establishment are not yet defined in concrete terms,
it is believed that such a center could help to improve the public's
understanding of questions and controversies that confront our
industry.
While the above describe briefly the broad spectrum of activ-,
ties that have been carried forward during the past year, a summary
of the Committee's activities would not be complete without an
appropriate evaluation of this work as it relates to the objectives of the Committee's responsibilities to MCA.
Such objectives clearly
must be understood in the light of the legislative and regulatory
climate that exists today.
Seen in this perspective, one can only
feel a keen sense of inadequacy — of constantly striving to barely
keep up with developments and the frustration of being able only to
superficially react to the various problems that continue to arise.
Despite the diligent efforts of restructuring the FDCC
Committee, it is believed that a more fundamental reevaluation of
the MCA activity in this area should be undertaken.
course, a variety of ways in which response to the greater burden
in this area of our activities can be made.
I would not propose as
part of this brief report to attempt to define in detail any partic­
ular solution.
It is appropriate, however, to recognize that the
time may have arrived whep the means which have served us well in
the past are no longer adequate to serve industries' needs in the
area of food, drug, and cosmetic chemicals.
MCA has always prided itself on the fact that committee leader­
ship and most of the working input comes from the member companies.
I suggest that this policy may no longer be appropriate in areas of
CMA 036993
fli
proliferating Legislation and regulation, such as food, drug and
cosmetic law.
These regulations are targeted at many areas,
frequently beyond the scope of interest of any single member company.
Therefore, I urge this Board to appoint a committee to study the
issue of from where should the leadership of any particular committee
come.
Should it be from the MCA staff, or should it continue to
come from the member companies.
The conclusion may not be the same
for all committees.
Nevertheless, X think this situation should
be given a fresh look.

Exhibit G
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
GEORGE A. COFFENBERG, CHAIRMAN
TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION COMMITTEE
MAY 11, 1976
In ray initial report for the Transportation and Distribution Committee
on April 8 of last year, I restricted my comments to two items of major sig­
nificance having future impact on the chemical industry. A more detailed
report on the Committee's activities was appended to my remarks. Today my
oral report will focus on three topics and I refer you to the filed report
for the balance.
The chemical industry owns or operates approximately 67,000 tank cars
and is compensated by the railroads through a mileage allowance of from 11.071
to 23.814 per loaded car mile depending on the value of the car. The rail­
roads pay an allowance to suppliers of private rail cars in that freight rates
take into consideration a cost to the railroads of supplying cars. Prior to
1964, the allowance per mile was a one-level allowance. A car owner or opera­
tor was paid the same rate per mile irrespective of whether a car had a value
The chemical industry, having the newer and higher valued cars, was of
the opinion that the compensation paid by the railroads should recognize the
difference of investment in the cars and pay a higher allowance to the more
valuable cars than paid to cars of lower value. After long negotiations, a
tri-level system of compensation was established in November 1964. However,
because of disagreement among the railroads as to how the system was to w rk,
the matter was contested before the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) with
the car suppliers on one side and the railroads on the other.
Coomienclng in 1964 through May of this year, three major car compensa­
tion cases have been adjudicated before the ICC. In 1971, after a fav rable
ICC decision to an MCA complaint, the three-level system of compensation es­
tablished in 1964 was changed to a six-level system. However, the rates of
compensation to be paid by the railroads were frozen to car values established
in 1968. The final case, ICC Docket 35537 instituted by MCA over four years
ago, is about to be discontinued as a result of an interim agreement negotia­
ted between the litigants. The negotiations followed a favorable decision by
Division 2 for MCA* MCA's complaint was supported by. the American Petroleum *
Institute, the Corn Refiners Association, the Institute of Shortening and
Edible Oils, the major tank car leasing companies and Allied Chemical Corp ra­
tion.
The interim agreement accomplishes the following:
(1) The mileage rate for all six levels of compensation was
to be Increased on thirty days' notice by 22-1/2%. This
Increase became effective May 1, 1976. Tank car compen­
sation had not been increased since January 1, 1971. It
is estlmatad that the increase annualized will return to
the tank car perators an additional $40 million. The
chemical Industry's share is estimated at $20 million.
CMA 036996
Sin<.e 1964, the railroads only adjusted tank car compen­
sation upward afcer adjudication of a complaint before
the ICC. The agreement provides chat tank car compensa­
tion will be adjusted in relation to and at the time the
railroads adjust the compensation paid one another for
use of each other's cars. The railroads have increased
the compensation paid to each ocher four times, aggregat­
ing 45%, since the last time tank car compensation was
increased. We expecc the new rates of compensation,
effective May I, will again be increased in the first
quarter of 1977 when the railroads increase car compensa­
tion to each other.
New tank cars entering the rail fleet, frozen at 1968
valuations for the purpose of compensation, will now
enter the fleet at their fair market value. For example,
a car valued in 1976 dollars at $27,000 will call for a
mileage race of 23.814 per loaded mile whereas prior to
this agreement, such cars would have been adjusted by a
formula to a value of $18,500 and compensated at a rate
of 21.894. Existing cars will be re-evaluated and if the
fair markec value of the car places it in a higher mile­
age group, the car will be reassigned to the higher group.
Tank car owners and operators will support the establish­
ment of an equalization rule whereby, the railroads will
be compensated for excess empty miles when empty miles
exceed loaded miles by more than 105^.
The ICC will issue an order commencing a rule making
proceeding for the purpose of establishing rules and
methods for determining cank car compensation in the
future. When completed, the ICC will issue another or­
der canceling the interim agreement and prescribing the
basis on which tank car compensation is to be paid and
the mechanisms for its implementation. Rule making may
take as long as three years to complete.
In summary, we not only see the light at the end of the tunnel, but we
can see the end of the tunnel. During che next three years, complex and
difficult negotiating will be carried out with the railroads under ICC super­
vision. MCA's objective will be to do its best to assure that the rules
finally prescribed will provide equitable compensation for those who supply
tank cars.
last report dealt at length with Public Law 92-500, the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act, and in particular, the 1972 amendments covering spills
of hazardous polluting substances and the civil penalties provided for such
spills in section 311. I advised that an ad hoc inter-Industry committee,
including MCA, was seeking legislative relief from the punitive provisions of
this section. H.R. 9560 was introduced September 11, 1975 to amend several
sections of the law and section 12 of the bill, while not totally to the lik­
ing of the ad hoc committee, would have been a vast improvement from the
existing law. MCA testified in support of the bill with caveats as to the
CMA 036996
meaning intended by certain language in the bill. MCA offered to work with
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the development of guidelines to
carry out the intent of cne dubious language along the lines of MCA's testi­
mony. EPA Administrator, Russell Train, testified in support of H.R. 9560,
including support of section 12. The desired revisions in the law, as en­
compassed in section 12, were recommended by the House Public Works Subcom­
mittee handling the bill.
However, in mark-up before the full House Committee on Public Works
and Transportation, the penalty language in section 12 underwent a significant
and unfortunate twist. The bill provided for a maximum penalty of $50,000.
In mark-up, to placate certain Committee members who were seeking to preserve
the maximum penalty of $5,000,000 when from a vessel and $500,000 when from a
shore-based facility, as provided in the 1972 amendments, the Committee ap­
proved a three-tier approach to penalties. The amendment, in effect provides
a maximum penalty of $50,000 for a first spill, a maximum of $100,000 for a
second spill, and a maximum of $500,000 for spills in excess of two during a
three-year period. The mark-up made no change in the language concerning
spills involving willful negligence or willful misconduct.
H.R. 9560 is expected to' obtain a rule from the Rules Committee for con­
sideration by the House some time this month, tt is the best judgment of
those who are familiar with legislative procedures that the mark-up committee
has made such a "Christmas Tree" of the bill, chat it stands a very good
chance of being voted down by the House. If this does not occur, because
S. 2710, the Senate's companion bill is so different than H.R. 9560, an ef­
fort will be made to return the penalty language to its original form during
the House and Senate conference. The fallback position will be to eliminate
section 12 in its entirety.
The transportation of hazardous materials continues to receive adverse
publicity far out of proportion to the safety its transportation record de­
serves. The Department of Transportation (DOT), through its Director of the
Office of Hazardous Materials when testifying on the Transportation Safety
Act of 1974, estimated that there are over two billion tons of hazsrdous
materials shipped annually with as many as 250,000 shipments tendered daily.
Major accidents involving hazardous materials have been relatively few when
considering the exposure, but each one raises new cries for increased regula­
tion.
Since 1968, the Department of Transportation has been attempting to
develop a new hazard information system integrating vehicle placards and
shipping papers with the ability for a quick emergency response. The DOT's
most recent effort is an advance notice of rule making identified Hazardous
Materials Docket No. 126. The XT requested that responses to the docket
evaluate nine hazard information systems proposed by respondents in a past
docket against nine criteria that a hazard Information system should meet.
MCA's response was a modification of its prior proposal and it is believed
more adequately meets the nine criteria than any of the other systems. It
integrates the vehicle placards, the shipping papers, an lnmediate ability
to respond, and CHEKTREC. The system is not only practical for implementa­
tion domestically including lntermodal transportation, but is readily adapt­
able for international shipments. We believe the MCA response is the lead­
ing candidate to be adopted by the DOT as a basis for a rule making proceed­
ing.
CMA 036997
M
- 4 The committee has a roster of thirty-six members and is organized
around eight standing subcommittees with the following areas of responsibility--hazardous materials, highway carriers, legislation, marine,
physical distribution, rail carriers, transportation environmental regula­
tions and a steering subcommittee. The steering subcommittee is comprised
of the other subcommittee chairmen and the committee officers.
Important matters currently involving the Transportation and Distribu­
tion Committee are:
I
Hazardous Materials Regulations. The hazard information (HI) system
proposed in HMR3 Docket No. 103; Notice 73-10, involved a two-digit
number for use on the vehicle placard and shipping paper as a key to
a response manual giving guidelines for an emergency response in the
event of a spill, leak or fire. DOT has discontinued HM-103 with
regard to the HI numbers. Simultaneously with the discontinuance of
part of HM-103, DOT instituted HM-126, and advance notice of rule
making inviting responses to evaluate nine HI systems received in
response to HM-103. MCA filed a timely response to HM-126 on
March 25, 1976. The revised MCA HI system filed is believed to meet
more closely the nine criteria against which each HI system is to be
evaluated than any other system.
1
Hazardous Materials Docket 127—Exemption Procedures. The Trans­
portation Safety Act of 1974 authorized the Secretary of Transp r-tation to grant exemptions from the Hazardous Materials Regulations'
similar to those formerly granted by DOT under the title of "Spe­
cial Permits." The rules and procedures for obtaining exemptions
became effective October 15 on conclusion of HM-127.
I
Prior to January 4, 1975, authority for the regulation of hazardous
materials was vested in each modal administrator (rail, highway,
water and air). Under the new Act, the Secretary has created the
Materials Transportation Bureau (MTB) with responsibility for the
operational functions of regulations, exemptions and compliance
with the Hazardous Materials Regulations. The MTB replaces the
Hazardous Materials Regulations Board (HMRB) which formerly c ordinated such matters.
Rail Carriers. Since April 1975, numerous freight rate dockets
substantially escalating charges for switching loaded and empty cars
appeared with little or no justification. MCA challenged these dock­
et*. and, in all but Isolated situations, the dockets were later
withdrawn by the carriers.
DOT Issued Emergency Order No. 5 requiring DOT Specifications 112A
and 114A, on uninsulated pressure tank cars containing flanmable
gases, to be shoved to rest, prohibiting humping or rolling switch­
es, as a result of railroad accidents In which such cars ruptured.
Through their freight rate dockets, the railroads proposed an arbi­
trary charge of from $100 to $300 per car per shipment for extra
handling. MCA challenged this arbitrary action and the carriers
later withdrew the proposal.
CMA 036998
5
III.
Highway.
ICC Docket MC-32155 (Sub.4) was an investigation under­
taken after petition by the National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. to
identify, segregate and accumulate cost for the cleaning of cargo
tanks.
ICC accounting requirements did not make provision for such
segregation. MCA filed statements supporting the segregation and
identification of chose costs. The proceeding has been successfully
concluded.
National Classification Board Docket 744. Subject 40, proposed the
arbitrary reclassification of Class A and B poisons to 200 times
first class for LTL shipments and 100 times first class for truckload shipments regardless of the classification rating for a par­
ticular product. Challenged, this arbitrary action by the National
Classification Board has been placed in suspension by the Board and
is believed dead.
The Federal Government, as an offset to the truckers because of the
national maximum speed limit of 55 miles per hour, authorised an
increase in the maximum weight for trucks on the Defense and Inter­
state Highway System from a gross weight of 73,280 to 80,000 pounds.
In order for vehicles to leave the Interstate System to pick up and
deliver freight, state weight limits must be increased allowing the
higher gross weight. The committee has recommended support for
state actions raising state weights to the interstate level.
Physical Distribution. At a one-day educational seminar preceding
the May Transportation and Distribution Committee meeting, MCA
member companies described the Interface of transportation informa­
tion with order entry and data base concepts. Several systems for
computerization of freight rates and routes were described.
During the October meeting, representatives of the National Tank
Truck Carriers, Inc. discussed service and economic problems
faced by the tank truck carrier industry. Arrangements are being
made to continue such dialogues with other major transportation
services at future meetings.
Marine. The development of regulations to implement the civil
penalties of section 311 of P.L. 92-500, the Federal Water Pol­
lution Control Act,has been monitored. Action seeking legisla­
tive relief from the punitive penalties of section 311 has not
been successful so far.
Environmental Regulations. The State of Illinois, through its
Pollution Control Board, has been considering, for seme time,
proposed toxic substances regulations. Transportation, in and
through the state, would have been seriously affected by the
proposed regulations. MCA participated in hearings opposing
inclusion of transportation in the regulations of the EPA.
The latest draft of the proposed regulations eliminates applica­
tion to transportation equipment.
CMA 036999
6
MCA and the National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. have scheduled a
seminar on " Tank Truck Waste Water Effluents--Regulations and
Disposition" on June 10-11, 1976 at the University of Wisconsin
in Madison. Although the EPA currently has assigned a low
priority to waste water treatment discharged from transporta­
tion equipment, an understanding of the problems is being
sought through such meeting.
VII.
Legislative.
1975 was the year for transportation legislation.
In September, MIA testified on several bills bearing various
titles affecting the rail industry (H.R. 9802, S. 1876 and
S. 2718). The composite of legislation eventually became
S. 2718--"The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform
Act of 1976." Several of the points made by MCA were adopted
in the legislation.
The Administration presently has before the Congress, a major
reform of the common and contract carrier regulatory system.
The legislation is termed the "Truck Regulatory Reform Act."
The T&D Conmittee has adopted positions with regard to princi­
ples Incorporated in the bill. To date, hearings have not been
scheduled. Meanwhile, meetings with framers of the bill in the
Department of Transportation have provided insight as to the
basis for the proposal and allowed explanation of chemical
industry reaction.

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
BY
R. E. PHILLIPS, CHAIRMAN
TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT COMMITTEE
May 11, 1976
This report is on behalf of the MCA Transportation Equipment Committee.
i
The TEC needs no introduction but a review of its charter is useful. The Committee is
comprised of 25 representatives of member companies and handles technical and technically
related problems having to do with the transportation of chemicals by tank car, tank truck,
portable and intermodal tank, barge and bulk ship. To accomplish this task, three
standing subcommittees deal in the separata areas of rail, truck/portable tank, aid marine.
The chairmen of these groups are E. G. Hansen (duPont), V. H. Goodwin (Exxon) and
M. M. Anderson (Union Carbide) respectively. Our vice chairman is J. R. Hopkins (Dow).
We operate under rules of practice as by the MCA board approved.
To enhance our technical activit ies, we enjoy advisory support from individual tank car
engineers, and we have an associate member from the Bureau of Explosives. The TEC
chairman represents the MCA as a member of the AAR' Tank Car Committee. We have
a voice on the American National Standards Institute committee dealing with intermodal
containers and we have informal liaison with the National Tank Truck Carriers and
the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association. Several of our Marine Subcommitte members
are active on the Coast Guard's Chemical Transportation Industry Advisory Committe .
Our most famous alumnus is J. T. Curtis, Jr. formerly of U. S. Steel and now Director of the
Materials Transportation Bureau of DOT.
Highlights of Current Activities
D. M. Long's report of Committee activites in May, last year, still applies in great measure.
We continue to devote significant activity to these items:
1
1. Tank car safety relief devices. Proposals are being processed for suggested
rulemaking concerning safety relief valves for tank cars carrying products
which should not be vented. Studies of safety vent materials are continuing.
2. We are following with interest the various tank car research programs which will
foster such innovations as thermal shielding, bottom outlet protection and
revised specifications for insulated tank can.
1
CMA 037001
3. The current’ tank truck and portable tank inspection requirements, (both domestic
and international) have been tabulated for the first time as a working document
for use in responding to anticipated regulatory revisions.
4. The success of our audio-visual training aid for pre-trip tank car inspection
has encouraged us to begin preparation of a similar program related to tank
trucks.
5. Our draft "Guidelines for Prevention and Control of Chemical Spills in Bulk
Rail and Highway Transportation" is in the final review stage befor presentation
to the Association for publication.
6. Several regulatory proposals in the marine area continue to require our attention,
including taikerman regulations, barge fleeting requirements, end developments
on manned vessel rulemaking.
7. We are concerned with the Environmental Protection Agency's hazardous
materials spills proposals and are contributing to the Associations' response.
8. DOT Docket HM 112 was finalized last month. This consolidation of the hazardous
materials regulations adopted several of MCA's recommendations. Certain areas,
such as the classification of poisons were put In abeyance and will require our
continued study.
Items for Future Consideration
Many of our "current" activities are "in anticipation" of future problems:
1. Recommend unloading hose requaiificatfon procedures are being developed.
2. We have actively participated in the development of proposals for a hazard
information system.
3. Possible revocation of visual inspection procedures for tank trucks is a matter on
which the Committee Is developing a position.
4. There is a possibility that the environmental effect of chemical spills may be a
matter for additional classification of commodities.
CMA 037002
The n w Material* Tramp rtation Bureau has revised the procedures for btaining exemptions
from the regulations. It is now necessary to provide full container and commodity data and
experience along with justification vd safety analyses to obtain exemptions for haidling
chemicals or containers not now included in the regulations.
The Transportation Equipment Committee will continue its efforts toward safety In the hcndling
and shipping of the industry's products, both by attention to the specific areas ennumerated and
to others as the need develops.

REPORT BY THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
WILLIAM M. STOVER
SEPTEMBER 14, 1976
CONGRESS NEARS ADJOURNMENT AMID GROWING ELECTION FEVER
Leaders of both the House and Senate continue to aim for
October 2 adjournment of the 94th Congress. Despite the fact
that both houses appear on schedule, some observers are
skeptical since Congress rately meets deadlines for ending
its work.
Not only are the remaining days few in number, but thoughts
of the November election are proving increasingly distracting
. to Members. A number of Congressmen have already gone home to
campaign and attendance problems could cause difficulty for
party leaders in these closing weeks as they attempt to complete
* remaining legislation.
The final days before adjournment are always a difficult
and uncertain period for Congress and for those who follow its
activities closely.
Time pressures and distractions lead to
hasty action in some cases and the legislative process becomes
all the more unpredictable.
Nonetheless, it is possible to speak with assurance on the
fate of several important bills which have received our attention
in recent months:
- the patent reform bill, earlier passed in objectionable
form by the Senate, will die in the House Judiciary
Committee;
- oil divestiture legislation never really got off the
ground but is certain to prove controversial in 1977.
- the bill providing for deregulation of natural gas is
stalled.
CMA 037038
2
On the other hand, passage appears likely for the Air
Quality Act Amendments, and for a Toxic Substances Control bill.
THE "PARENS PATRIAE" BILL IS STILL ALIVE
A major anti-trust reform bill continues to move through
the Congress.
The Senate last week passed a very tough and
controversial version.
As a result, parliamentary maneuvering
is underway as opponents seek to block passage by the House.
The major provisions of the legislation are:
- expanded investigative authority for the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission;
- requirement for pre-merger notification of Justice and
FTC where companies fit certain trigger guidelines, thus
giving the Government the opportunity to block intended
mergers;
- the controversial "parens patriae" section, allowing
state attorneys general to bring treble-damages classaction suits against businesses on behalf of the state's
citizens.
WATER QUALITY AMENDMENTS NEARING CONFERENCE
House and Senate conferees will soon meet to determine the
fate of a bill amending the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
in several significant respects. Major point of contention will
be the wording of the wetlands section - that is, how to control
pollution resulting from dredge and fill operations in wetlands,
lakes and streams.
Other provisions:
- construction grants for municipal sewage treatment plants;
- funding for EPA aid in the form of loan guarantees for
cities' shares of Federally-funded sewage treatment projects;
- modification of deadlines within which public treatment
plants must meet requirements.
CMA 037039
r
The wetlands pollution controversy arises as a result of
regulations written by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to
the original Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (92-500).
A 1975 court ruling held that these regulations apply to all
waters of the U. S. and not just those defined as navigable
under the law.
Staff members of the House and Senate Public Works Committees
have been meeting in an effort to find a basis for compromise.
Regardless of the outcome, the next Congress will be con­
ducting an in-depth review of PL 92-500 and the report of the
president's Commission on Water Quality. MCA expects to take
an active role in those deliberations and our preparations are
already underway.
ENACTMENT SEEMS LIKELY FOR SOLID WASTE LEGISLATION
The Senate calls it "solid waste utilization" while the
House refers to it as "resource conservation and recovery", but
whatever the name, a new solid waste law appears to be in
prospect.
M
The Senate passed S. 2150 last June in a generally acceptable
form,
in recent months the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee has been at work on several versions of its own.
Subcommittee draft language was circulated for comment and a
number of helpful changes incorporated.
The Committee bill has
now been cleared for House floor consideration next week.
It
appears unlikely that the House/Senate conference will encounter
substantial difficulty and enactment appears to be a good bet.
Industry appears favorably inclined toward both bills.
The major provisions:
- mandatory Federal standards on hazardous waste, including
its generation, transport, storage and disposal? EPA may
delegate implementation to the states;
- EPA guidelines for state solid waste management plans,
with grants and technical aid handled through a new
Office of Discarded Materials;
- substantial EPA research and development programs aimed
at small-scale and low-technology systems, sludge
management, reducing air quality problems from incineration,
and energy recovery;

- study programs in eleven specified areas including
plastics recovery, energy recovery, sludge reduction,
and waste reduction.
OUTLOOK FAVORABLE FOR MASSIVE TAX REFORM BILL
It has taken two years, over a thousand pages of text, and
two weeks of intensive House/Senate conferences, but the massive
tax reform bill is finally near enactment.
It must be considered
the most significant tax bill since 1969 since it impacts the
taxation of every individual and corporation in the United
States.
The bill extends through next year, although in somewhat
different form, the anti-recession tax cuts voted last year by
the Congress.
It places higher taxes on upper-bracket taxpayers
through increased minimum taxes and reduction of "tax shelters".
It alters treatment of estate and gift taxes, deductions for the
use of private homes in business, deductions for vacation homes,
and individual retirement accounts.
Especially significant is the fact that the bill raises
approximately $1.6 billion in revenue for the next fiscal year.
This was essentially the target of the House bill and of both
the Senate and House Budget Committees.
The bill is therefore
regarded as something of a victory for House Ways and Means.
Committee Chairman A1 Ullman (D-Ore.), and for the new Congressional
budget-setting process itself.
To refresh your memory, the Tax Reform Act passed the House
in December 1975 and in the Spring underwent hearings in the
Senate Finance Committee for about two months. Mr. F. Perry
Wilson testified on behalf of MCA, urging adoption of provisions
which would encourage capital investment and opposing changes in
tax provisions related to foreign operations of U. S. companies.
The Committee completed mark-up of its bill in mid-June and
the Senate floor debate began later that month. A bi-partisan
coalition of moderates, led by Senator Russell Long, held off
the efforts of "reformers" to add a variety of anti-business
amendments.
The Senate passed the measure in early August.
Last
week House and Senate conferees reached agreement on all pro­
visions.

The conference compromise contains the following items of
interest to our industry:

The Economic Outlook
There is some concern by many in industry that July and August
have been more than the normal doldrums of summer.
Certainly, many
areas have been fitful at best.
On the other hand, early August
sales in major retail chains have evidenced encouraging strength.
The real nagging concern is the lack of any strength in the housing
market and no signs yet of any major move in plant and equipment
expenditures.
Inflationary pressures are at least passive for the present.
But again, projections of shortages in primary industry, with only
slight increases in capacity utilization due to the lack of new
capacity installations in recent years, are a cause for real
concern to many.
The question of where eight million college students will get
jobs and what their reactions will be if they do not find the kind
of employment to which they feel they are entitled? the continuing
decapitalization of primary capital-intensive industry due to
inadequate depreciation policy and the failure to date of much of
industry to reduce its dividend-payout ratios in order to compensate
for the shortfall in depreciation; the inability to economically
justify new plant expenditures on the basis of present profit
levels — all these concerns hang like a heavy cloud over a recovery
which to many is not as buoyant as they might have hoped, admitting
that to others the lack of boom conditions is a good sign for a
lengthy recovery period.
Add to this the voiced concern of the believers in the
Kondratieff long-wave cycle theory and you tend to join Tillich
when he said "we must learn to be comfortable with ambiguity".
Wage and Price Controls
CMA 037043
Wage and price controls continue in effect in Canada, so that
Canadian member companies of MCA as well as US member companies
ln their Canadian operations face problems similar to those which
confronted US industry during the 1971-1974 period.
Here in the United States, the Council on Wage and Price
Stability continues to focus attention on situations it regards as
inflationary. However, while it does have subpoena power, it has
no enforcement authority.
In view of the solid opposition of both
business and labor, there is no present likelihood of the renewed
imposition of mandatory wage and price controls.
3. The Hart Bills
Senator Hart of Michigan three years ago introduced a bill
titled "The Industrial Reorganization Act" and last year rein­
troduced a slightly revised version.
The bill was intended to
facilitate the splitting of companies in a number of named industries
into smaller units, provided that certain arbitrary arithmetical
measures indicate the existence of "economic concentration" in the
given industry. The chemical industry was one of seven listed as a
possible target.
This bill was formally abandoned by Senator Hart on May 13
this year. He conceded that its enactment was not "politically
feasible...in the foreseeable future." He then introduced a more
modest Monopolization Reform Act (S. 3429).
It would amend the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act in four respects:
it would eliminate any requirement of proof of intent
to monopolize in actions brought by the United States;
it would eliminate superior performance as a defense
to actions brought by the United States;
(3) it would eliminate the prima facie effect of a Government
judgment in such an action for subsequent private triple
damages;
it would allow courts to take into consideration economics
of scale in fashioning remedies.
No action is expected this year on this new Hart bill, and
indeed (in view of Senator Hart's decision not to seek re-election)
its future is dubious.
When the Hart Industrial Reorganization Act' was first introduced
MCA (in order to be prepared for all contingencies), engaged an
economic consultant. Professor Steven Lustgarten of Baruch College,

City University of New York, to assist in preparing the chemical in­
dustry's case.
His report, "An Analysis of the Chemical Industry in
view of the Proposals for Deconcentration," has been completed and
is available. While Senator Hart's Judiciary Subcommittee on Anti­
trust and Monopoly did not in fact hold any hearings on the chemical
industry, the Lustgarten report should be helpful in case Congress
in the future should turn its attention to our industry.
4. Divestiture in the Oil industry
es
i
Since the energy crisis initiated by the Arab oil boycott in
1973, there has been growing pressure inside Congress and outside
for divestiture in the oil industry - vertical divestiture, limiting
oil companies to one or two of the four basic functions of the in­
dustry (production, transportation, refining, and marketing) and
horizontal divestiture, requiring oil and gas producers to divest
their interests in other energy sources (coal, uranium, oil shale,
By a vote of 8 to 7, the Senate Judiciary Committee has reported
out S, 2387, a vertical divestiture bill.
It would require the 18
largest oil companies to divest themselves of vertically integrated
holdings within five years. No further action is expected on the
bill this year.
The Administration opposes it.
On the whole.
Democratic Presidential nominee Carter inclines against vertical
divestiture, although he seems to favor horizontal divestiture.
The Economic Policy Review Committee has recommended that MCA
oppos
"legislative divestiture and/or divorcement of the oil in­
dustry and ...similar Congressional efforts in other major indus­
5. Federal Chartering of Corporations
A series of Senate Commerce Committee hearings, chaired by
Senator Hartke, were held early this summer on the issues of corporat responsibility/federal chartering, offering Ralph Nader a
forum in which to push his advocacy of federal chartering for
larger corporations, a favorite cause of his. However, with both
the Ford Administration and Democratic Presidential nominee Carter
in opposition to this, it appears unlikely to get anywhere for the
time being.
The Economic Policy Review Committee will continue to
monitor any developments in this area.
6. Economic Planning Task Force
CMA0ST046
A task force, h aded by Harold Passer of Eastman Kodak, has
been organized to review the various proposals in the area of eco­
nomic planning being mooted in the Congress and elsewhere.
It
will hold its first meeting September 15.
7. Multinational Corporations
The Economic Policy Review Committee is represented by two
members on a special MCA task force dealing with the problems
facing multinational corporations.
Other MCA Committees represented
are Tax Policy, International Trade, Government Relations, and
Public Relations.
Multinational corporations are under study and/or attack
in a number of international and national forums.
There is the
UN Commission on Transnational Corporations, with a related UN
information and research center.
There is the International Labor
Organization (ILO), which is conducting a study on the social impact
of multinational corporations.
There is the Organization of American
There is the UN Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), where the Third World nations rally for their attack upon
And there is, most constructively from the point of view of
industry, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
At home, the most important forums are Senator Church's Sub­
committee on Multinational Corporations and the tax-writing Com­
mittees of the Congress - Ways and Means in the House and Finance
in the Senate.
The task force has been monitoring developments in all these
forums.
Thanks to an effective industry educational campaign, the
drive for punitive taxation of MNC's was largely turned back in
the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees.
The most
dynamite-packed issue, however, is that of payoffs abroad.
The
Administration is sponsoring a bill calling, in effect, for dis­
closure, while a bill approved by the Senate Banking Committee
would outlaw such payments.
Multinational corporations got off reasonably well at the
annual meeting of the ILO this summer.
The UN Commission on
Transnational Corporations is at work on guidelines, but is not
scheduled to produce them for eighteen months or so.
By far the most important recent development on the interi
national stage was the adoption by the OECD on June 21 of a
statement on "International Investment and Multinational Enterprises."!
CMA 037046
This statement, the product of lengthy negotiations among the 24
industrialized nations represented in the OECD, sets forth sound
voluntary standards for business conduct throughout the world and
includes many of the principles long endorsed by MCA member companies
operating internationally.
In particular, the statement:
* Provides for national treatment of enterprises owned by
foreign investors, so that they will be accorded treatment no
less favorable than that accorded domestic enterprises in like
situations;
* Recognizes the sanctity of contracts between governments and
enterprises;
* Recognizes the positive contributions which multinational
enterprises can make to world economic and social progress;
* Encourages the use of international arbitration in resolving
disputes between governments and enterprises.
The OECD statement is not only important in itself, but should
enable the industrial nations to take a unified and constructive
posture as the debate over multinational corporations progresses in
the wider forum of the United Nations.

Exhibit H
REPORT TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
Ronald S. Wishart, Jr.f Chairman
Energy Conservation Committee
September 14,
1976
This is the first report of the Energy Conservation Committee,
established by the Board of Directors at its November 1975 meeting.
Up to that date, and beginning in October 1974, an ad hoc committee
had dealt with energy conservation matters.
From October 1974
onward, the Committee has maintained, where legally feasible; a
close liaison and active cooperation with the Department of Comm rce and with the FEA and its contractors.
Since its establishment,
two major responsibilities:
the Committee has been dealing with
1. Supervising the ongoing voluntary program of twice-yearly
reports on energy conservation to the Department of Commerce and
the F deral Energy Administration.
As of the preparation of this
report, the most recent energy conservation report was that submitt d in April 7 of this year, in which 107 MCA member companies
participated.
The report showed energy conservation for the
calendar year 1975 as 4.0% per unit of output, compared with 1972
as a base year.
Without the energy costs of OSHA and environmental
regulations in effect in 1975 but not in 1972, the energy conserva­
tion rate would have been 4.9%.
An over-riding reason for the
relative modesty of these figures was that, due to the recession,
our industry was operating at only 74.2% of capacity in 1975, com­
pared with 83.5% in 1972.
There are very few major MCA member companies not taking part
in MCA's energy reporting program or those of other relevant associ­
ations, such as the Fertilizer Institute and the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association.
These few companies have been individually
contacted, and will hopefully be taking part in the next report to
the two Federal agencies, due in mid-September.
This voluntary program is the result of^an October 1974
meeting between top Commerce Department and FEA officials and top
officials of some 28 major chemical companies, all MCA members.
At
this meeting, there was agr ement on a consensus energy conservation
goal of 15% per unit of output by calendar 1980 as compared with
CMA 037048
calendar
1972.
2. Since December 1975, when the President signed into law
the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, the Committee has been
seeking to cope with the new industrial energy conservation pro­
visions which are part of this Act.
The Act focuses on the ten leading energy-consuming industries
by two-digit SIC codes, officially identified early this year.
Not
surprisingly, our industry (SIC 28) ranks first.
For each of these top 10 industries, FEA is to set an energy
conservation goal, replacing the consensus goals under which many
industries, including ours, have been operating.
FEA has contracted
with outside consultants to study each of the ten industries and
propose goals - which, of course, FEA can accept or modify.
Because of the complexity of the chemical industry, FEA
initially had difficulty getting an appropriate contractor to take
on the job.
However, thanks in part to MCA's interest in having a
qualified contractor take on this responsibility, Battelle Memorial
Institute finally undertook it, with Chem Systems as subcontractor
The engineering and technical subcommittee of the Energy Conservation
Committee worked closely with the contractors, aiding them individually
and collectively in their demanding task, and contributing their ex­
pertise in methodology.
The contractors have submitted their .report,
and it will be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER in late September,
with public hearings in October.
It is quite possible that consumer and environmental groups may
testify in opposition to any proposed reasonable target for our
industry, so MCA must be prepared to testify in its own behalf.
Internal studies carried on by the Committee indicate that the in­
dustry can meet a target in the neighborhood of 15%.
In further conformity with EPCA requirements, FEA must identify
the top energy-consuming companies in each of the ten already-iden­
tified industries - either the 50 highest-ranking companies or
those using over a trillion BTU's in energy per year, whichever
number is smaller.
Some 60 companies reporting through MCA have
listed energy purchases of over a trillion BTU's a year, and there
may be other such companies reporting through the Fertilizer
Institute, etc.
It therefore seems likely that the cut-off point
for chemical companies will be somewhat over a trillion BTU's per
CMA 037049
r
Under EPCA provisions and regulations, companies reporting
through industry programs such as MCA's may be exempted from indi­
vidual reporting, even if it would otherwise be required of them.
The criteria for acceptable industry programs will be published in
the FEDERAL REGISTER.
However, because FEA is falling behind its
EPCA timetable, there remains a 50/50 chance that companies may
have to file at least one mandatory individual report in early 1977.
Another section of EPCA provides for the encouragement and
subsidy of state energy programs.
Here MCA's prime interest is in
exempting major industries like ours from reporting to the various
states, since they already report to Federal agencies.
If, however,
some states insist upon industrial energy conservation reporting,
w would urge them to adopt the same system already in effect for
Federal reporting.
After monitoring two regional hearings on
state programs, MCA testified to this effect at the plenary
hearing in Washington in July.
Another area of FEA concern outside of EPCA is its program
to promote fuel conversion from oil and gas to coal.
The future
issues subcommittee of the Energy Conservation Committee has mon-itored the questionnaires to be sent out to companies in this area,
and has made recommendations which have been persuasively relayed
to FEA through a task force of the Industrial Energy Users Forum.
~ A genuine success was realized in modifying some unreasonable re­
quests - e.g. obtrusive financial questions in the Major FuelBurning installation questionnaire.
The Energy Conservation Committee has four subcommittees:
engineering and technical? state relations; fuel types; and future
issues.
It has also established fruitful liaison with three other
MCA standing Committees: Government Relations, Legal Advisory, and
Public Relations.
Government Relations contacts have been useful in dealing with
legislation going through the Congress concerned in one way or
another with energy conservation.
Public Relations have helped in
the explanation of the effect on energy conservation of the
relatively low capacity at which the industry was functioning in
calendar 1975 - and our presentation in this regard was welcomed
by the Department of Commerce and the Federal Energy Administration
as supportiv
of their reports to the public.
Furthermore, Public
Relations ass mbled and distributed internal and external publica­
tions by m mber companies designed to promote energy conservation.
We shall look to Legal Advisory liaison for advice in preparing
testimony for the various public hearings which will be scheduled
as part of the EPCA program.

APPENDIX - ENERGY SITUATION UPDATE
TOTAL ENERGY
Total energy demand declined,
over the period 1973-75.
During the first half of 1976 energy
demand increased sharply and the year-end demand is expected to
near 1973 levels.
Post-1976 energy demand is projected to grow
OIL
Oil products demand declined from 17.3 to 16.6 MM B/D (-3.0% AAI)
during 1973-75.
During the first half of 1976 oil products
demand increased sharply, nearing the 1973 levels.
Domestic crude oil production declined at about -4% AAI (1973-75),
although the first half of 1976 showed a slowing of this decline.
Imports (crude oil and products) reached a record level near
first half of 1976 and are expected to approach 10 to 11
‘ North Slope crude oil is expected to provide about 2 MM B/D. by
the early 1980's and reverse the decline in domestic production
through the 1980's.
' The Trans-Alaskan pipeline is about a month behind schedule and
completion could be delayed even further due to welding defects
(current target completion date is December, 1976).
Outer Continental Shelf lease sales have been held for Alaska,
California, and Atlantic (the development schedule for these
leases is undecided).
The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (December 22, 1975)
established a new crude oil pricing mechanism (initial crude
oil price rollback plus maximum 10%/year price increases) and
required review of oil product price decontrol Qto date,
residual fuel oil, distillates, naphthas (except SNG plant
feedstock) and gas oils have been decontrolled^].
EPCA required
PEA to develop a plan for the maintenance and storage (equiva­
lent of 3 months of imports) of readily available inventories
of crude and products for use during energy shortages.
EPCA
also established efficiency standards for automobiles and ef­
ficiency targets for major appliances and major industries.
oil equivalent barrels per day.
2) Average Annual Increase
CMA 037051
NATURAL GAS
Domestic production continued to decline (-6.3% AAI 1973/75)
with 1976 production estimated at about 19 trillion cubic
feet.
No reversal of the downward trend is expected through
1985.
A new pricing program was recently proposed by FPC for
escalating the price of three "new" gas (post-1/1/73) classifi­
cations.
This program is currently subject to litigation and
possible congressional legislation.
Classification III new
gas (sale to interstate commerce initiated on or after 1/1/75)
is raised from about $0.52/Mcf. to $1.42/Mcf. and escalated at
$0.01/Mcf./quarter starting 10/1/76.
COAL
Production has increased at about 3 to 4% AAI since 1973 with
1976 production estimated at about 660 MM tons.
Interior's freeze
on coal leasing in the western states is expected to be lifted
early in 1977; however, FEA's objective of doubling coal produc­
tion by 1985 is considered optimistic.
Related developments;
Sierra Club vs. Kleppe suit has been
settled - no extended regional impact statement is required;
Coal Leasing Act has been enacted over Presidential veto sets rules for leasing federal lands; interior Department surface
mine reclamation rules have been established; proposed federal
strip mining legislation has been vetoed twice in the last two
years.
ELECTRIC UTILITIES
Electricity sales, which grew at about 7.5% AAI (1973/75) leveled
off during 1974, increased about 2% in 1975 and showed about a
5% gain during the first half of 1976.
Post-1976 sales growth
FEA coal burning orders are now in effect for 30 of the 74 ,new
power plants earlier designated by FEA for coal burning facili­
ties.
Besides the remaining 44 new power plants an additional
48 new power plants have also been designated for coal burning
facilities.
During 1975,74 existing power plants were issued
orders to convert to coal.
Nuclear electricity generation reached about 9% of total genera­
tion during the first half of 1976 and is expected to increase
to about 30% by 1985.
Court rulings held that:
the environmental effects of the
complete nuclear fuel cycle should be considered in individual
license applications (concerned the Vermont Yankee Plant - in
operation since 1972); and, energy conservation should be con­
sidered as an alternate to building a nuclear plant.
CMA 037052
T.pgisIation was recently enacted in California which requires
an extensive study of nuclear power plant feasibility and
poses further delays for new nuclear plants in that state.
Although the California anti-nuclear initiative did not pass,
at least five other states have similar initiatives on the
November ballot.
AMENDMENTS TO THE OT.EAN ATR AOT
No-significant deterioration of air quality regulations published
by EPA were upheld by a recent court decision and Congress is
seeking to establish its own standards.
New amendments to the Act have been passed by the Senate and the
House is currently debating their version.
Both bills include:
tightening of the no-significant deterioration requirements for
"clean" areas; some relaxation of the automotive emission
standards; compliance date extensions for industrial and utilities
emission sources; and, additional controls for "polluted" areas.
ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
ERDA has developed a National Plan for multi-billion dollar
development and commercialization of new technologies (enhanced
oil and gas recovery, oil shale, geothermal, solar, nuclear,
synthetic fuels...) and conservation (energy efficiency)
technologies.
INTERNATIONAL
World crude prices remain steady with the decision by OPEC
members in May to postpone further price increases; however,
some price increases may be forthcoming after the December, '1976
meeting.
The International Energy Agency has just approved a detailed
guide for sharing all available oil in case of a new oil embargo.
To reduce its members* dependence on foreign oil, IEA also has
a long-range program which includes:
tough conservation policies,
incentives such as guaranteed minimum prices to stimulate other,
indigenous energy resources, and stepped up research on new energy
sources such as solar power, hydrogen, and fusion.
OPEC production increased from 27.1 MM B/D in 1975 to 28.2 MM B/D
during the first quarter of 1976 which reduced shut-in capacity

Exhibit I
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
John B. Clark, Chairman
Patent and Trademark Committee
September 14,
1976
you will recall that it is the responsibility of the Patent
nd Trademark Committee to maintain an awareness of new developments
in the industrial property field having present or prospective impact
on the chemical industry; to determine MCA positions where warranted,
and to act either directly or through the Board of Directors, as is
appr0priate, in making MCA viewpoints known.
Last October I had the opportunity to report to you on the
status of patent legislation in the Congress.
You will recall it was
predicted that S-2255 would be passed by the Senate and forwarded to
^he House for their consideration.
You will also recall that in the
Hkinion of your Patent Committee, S-2255 is an ill-conceived piece of
legislation which will have a serious negative impact on the value
of the patent system.
S-2255 was passed by the Senate and sent to the House with
little substantive amendment despite serious efforts by MCA and others
, to modify and improve objectionable sections.
As of today, it appears
unlikely that the House subcommittee responsible for patent legislation
will get to 'S-2255 this year, and as a result, it will die with this
Congress.
While this is welcome news in that it maintains the status
quo for the time being, we can very likely expect renewed activity
next year.
I should note that several changes are needed to improve the
patent system, and that the most important of these — a system for
the re-examination of patents — is the subject of another bill
sponsored by Rep. Wiggins of California.
Rep. Wiggins is minority
leader of the House subcommittee concerned with patent legislation
and he appears to be concerned with preserving and strengthening the
patent system.
Our Committee is prepared to continue to assist in the
development of constructive changes in the law and its primary efforts
wil1 continue to be geared in this direction.
I wish to speak briefly about what is happening in the inter^^ional area, but before proceeding in that direction, I should note
at
Patent Committee has also provided comments to ERDA on a
^ patent policy.
Basically, we recommended a policy designed
attract participation in Government-sponsored research by companies
CMA 037054
with a background and experience in the energy field.
To this end,
we urged adoption of a policy which would provide a flexible approach
to ownership of patents resulting from Government-sponsored R&D, and wh
would permit the Government Administrator to grant exclusive or
partially exclusive licenses to energy inventors where title is vested
in the Government.
To proceed now with developments in the international area,
you are all aware of the changing attitudes of many of the Developing
Countries,
in the industrial property and technology transfer areas,
this has resulted in new laws in Mexico and other South American
J
countries, a proposed new law in Canada, and a great deal of activity
in various U.N. agencies and the Organization of American States, etc. !
Since a number of MCA member companies are concerned with these changes,
we are seeking to define the part MCA should play in this connection.
While to date our activity has been limited, we have been consulted
by and have provided our comments to the U.S. Government negotiators
with regard to efforts by Developing Countries to change the Paris
Convention on patents and trademarks.
In addition, and in response to ;
notification of a proposed negative change in the patent law of
Taiwan affecting the chemical industry, an Ad Hoc Group of Patent
Committee members, together with the U.S. Assistant Commissioner of
Patents, were invited to meet with the Taiwanese Minister of Economic
Affairs to assist him in understanding the economic consequences of whai
they were proposing to do.
This meeting was held and it appeared to
those present that they achieved a substantial portion of our objective!
and that the proposed change will be moderated.
We will gain a better
feel for this as we experience Patent Office decisions in the future.
j
On another front, Canada is proposing a number of radical
changes to their patent law, which, if accepted, would substantially
reduce the attractiveness of seeking patents in Canada.
Commissioner of Patents, together with a small industry group, has
been invited by the authors of the proposed changes to meet with them
to discuss the ramifications of adoption.
While this is not solely
an MCA Patent Coirmittee activity, we are heavily represented.
The
delegation is intended to be a cross-section of U.S. industry, and in
addition to MCA members DuPont, Phillips, Merck, and Monsanto, both
IBM and G.E. will participate.
The meeting is scheduled for October 21
and preparations are in full swing.
Finally, it is my strong feeling that MCA must continue to
play a role ex-U.S. and we will be attempting to define this role
more clearly in the coming year.

PROPOSED PROJECT
ON
HYDROCARBON EMISSION CONTROL COST ANALYSIS
The Air Quality Committee recommends MCA engage an inde­
pendent contractor to conduct a study of the cost of control­
ling emissions to the unprecedented new low levels being
planned by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Committee
further recommends the study, requiring 8-10 months at a pro­
posed cost of $95,500, be assigned to Foster D. Snell.
Some member company ®timates place the new permanent in­
vestment cost at $5 billion to $15 billion for reducing an es­
timated 2 million tons per year of hydrocarbon emissions to the
new levels. Annual operating and maintenance costs would be in
Draft EPA guideline documents
indicate estimates of control costs at much lower levels.
The
critical nature of the contemplated reductions can be appreci­
ated from realizing that 15 lbs/day may be the maximum allowed,
whereas 300 lbs/day now are permitted in most circumstances.
The study has been designed to ascertain how much it will
cost, using reasonably available control technology (RACT), to
reach four levels of hourly emission rates and four levels of
daily rate limits.
The study will yield data necessary to es­
tablish the relevant cost-benefit correlations needed to define
the crucial point of diminishing return and the cost effectiv ness of at least four basic RACT methods.
Data will be provided by MCA member company plants.
Analysis
will be made by the contractor,
it is expected that about 500
individual member company plant responses will be obtained. Data
will be encoded for confidentiality and to facilitate retrieval
for analysis.
Original data sheets will not be copied and will
be returned to the originator after the study is complete.
Infor­
mation will be gathered on emission characteristics (flow volume,
composition, concentration, solubility, etc.), by sources (stacks,
vents, reliefs, etc.) according to plant location.
Current levels
of control, the methods employed, and the costs will be stated.
Estimates of the cost of control will be compared against known
situations to validate overall estimating procedures.
Manufac­
turers will be interviewed on a selected basis for further cross­
comparison and to apply their knowledge of the most recent RACT.

To avoid duplication of effort, liaison will continue with
other organizations, such as the Texas Chemical Council, con­
cerned with similar studies.
There is little doubt as to EPA direction.. EPA considers
nearly all hydrocarbons to be photochemical oxidant precursors,
regardless of their relative photolytic reactivity.
EPA has
advised 45 states to revise their State Implementation Plans
(SIP), and to ensure compliance with the Clean Air Act of 1970
(P.L. 91-604) which does not allow new source permits in non­
attainment areas.
Of the 247 Air Quality Regions (AQR), 74 are
classed non-attainment because of oxidant levels.
Major pro­
jects are stopped, -in jeopardy, or delayed because P-L. 91-604
does not permit new sources in non-attainment regions.
EPA has
also announced a goal of 90% reduction in hydrocarbon vapor
losses from autos and light trucks.
Currently, there is no industry data for development of
rational regulations or workable guidelines.
This study is in­
tended to define the cost parameters so that a cost-benfit as­
sessment can be related to the results of varying levels of con­
trol and different strategies that could be employed to reach
them.
Acceptance of the project proposal is recommended.

PROPOSED STUDY
ON
OXIDANT LEVEL CONTROL STRATEGY ANOMALIES
When P.L. 91-604, Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, was
enacted, it was expected that national ambient air quality
standards (NAAQS) would be met nationwide by 1975 or mid-1977
at the latest.
Timely compliance has not been achieved for th
criteria pollutants in many of the 247 air quality regions (ACR).
Oxidant (ozone) levels are being exceeded in 74 regions, nearly
all of which encompass chemical industry concentrations.
prove their technical understanding for enforcing the NAAQS, EPA
studies in 1974-75 focused on the contribution of urban ozone pre­
cursor emissions to ambient ozone concentrations and on the rel­
ative roles of local ozone formations and long range transport.
Even though observed high ozone concentrations cannot be explained
in terms of air flow from specific point sources or even from sin­
gle urban-industrial sources, EPA now is acting to require com­
pliance with P.L. 91-604.
Reduction of hydrocarbon emissions from
mobile and stationary sources will be required, in spite of the
fact that evidence exists showing that such will not necessarily
prevent the occurrence of high ozone concentrations at any given
site.
In order to provide data as to the effectiveness of-proposed
hydrocarbon control strategies, the Air Quality Committee (AQC)
r commends a study to assess the relationship between hydrocarbon
levels from point sources and ozone levels.
The study needs to be undertaken now so that the results can
be available prior to the adoption of hydrocarbon controls, ex­
pected during the second quarter of 1977.
The study, proposed to
be conducted by the Radian Corporation, will cost $54,500.
Twelve metropolitan areas would be analyzed, selected as rep­
resentative of chemical industry concentrations (e.g., Houston)
and of non-chemical areas (e.g., Denver).
Emission inventories
for hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides will be obtained for recent
years, organized on a uniform basis, and placed on magnetic tape
for data reduction after certification of the basic validity of
the data. Ambient air data will be obtained for comparable time
periods and qualified to be certain that it is correct, is rep-
CMA 037072
resentative, and covers the same time period as the emission
data.
Correlations then will be drawn among high hourly ozone
values, their persistence, annual average concentration of
ozone and hydrocarbon emissions. A special analysis will be
made of unusual episodes and particular attention will be given
to synoptic meteorological conditions associated with the unu­
sual episodes.
A report will be prepared describing the results
and whether, in retrospect, current or proposed hydrocarbon con­
trol strategies would have worked to reduce ozone levels in the
vicinity where control was imposed.
Regional differences will
be exposed.
The final report will include data describing regional var­
iations and characteristic patterns needed to help formulate
local decisions as to the severity, complexity and appropriate­
ness of the regional control strategies themselves.
This could
be extended to define which hydrocarbon species need to be con­
trolled first or most, whether drastic reductions in auto traffic
will work in the particular area in question, and what the con­
sequences of exceeding the standards by different amounts and
varying frequencies would be, based on what has happened before.
Acceptance of the proposed study is recommended.

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMITTEE
OCTOBER 12,
1976
In an effort to illustrate to you the relative importance of
matters that are now pending pertaining to international trade,
! would like to quote from Ambassador Frederick Dent of the
Office of Special Trade Representative (STR).
The occasion was
a plenary meeting in Washington some two weeks ago for a group
of Industry Sector Advisory committees (or ISAC). Ambassador
pent told us that imports into this country in 1976 are expect­
ed to be up 20% over those of 1975, while exports will be up
only 5%. The expected trade deficit will be approximately
4*o billion dollars.
Imports of petroleum products in the U.S.A.
1973 were valued at 7 billion dollars.
This year they are
expected to reach 32 billion dollars.
Gentlemen, the need for industry support in the international
trade area has never been as great as it is now.
Today in the
United States the cost of feedstock for the petrochemical in­
dustry is less than the corresponding cost in the Common Market
(EC), but it is expected to be equal to that of the common
Market in about four years. Your International Trade committee
suggests that strong continued industry support on internation­
al trade is a must.
I am advised that the subject of trade did not appear in the
top 10 items which certain MCA member companies agreed to be
those subjects of the greatest concern to them according to a
recent survey.
However, it does appear that we could have
long-range problems in our economy, unless international trade
for our country increases to offset these deficits.
With this scenario in mind, I would now like to give you an
°utline of what I hope to cover in the next 10 to 12 minutes.
First, i plan to spend about 3 minutes on the status of the
'T negotiations.
The main part of my presentation to you
1 last about 8 minutes, and this is devoted to the work
t is going on in ISAC-5 (Chemicals).
i would like to wind
UP with a brief comment concerning OCITA (Office of chemical
industry Trade Advisor) .

In regard to GATT, I am aware that Dr. Dawson has pretty much
kept you up to date in this area.
The written report of these
remarks that you will receive will give you the details of how
the tariff formula, which was first tabled by the U.S.A., dif­
fers from the one that the common Market brought out in.July.
The tariff formula tabled by the U. S. suggests that all tariffs
above 6.7% be cut by 60% (the maximum allowed by the Trade Act),
and those below 6.7% by a formula of cuts between 50-60%.
The
EC formula proposes tariffs would be cut by their own amount, a
process that would be repeated four times.
That is to say, a
tariff of 50% would initially be cut b^ 50%, the result being a
25% tariff.
Doing this four more times would mean an ultimate
tariff of 13%.
The European version tends to embrace more
"harmonization" in that it cuts the higher duties more than our
formula does.
we remain critical of the EC proposal in that it specifically
excludes agricultural products.
The common Market still hopes
to keep this delicate subject separate from other trade areas.
The International Trade Committee shares the feeling that the
EC formula is not ambitious enough since it would result in an
av rage reduction of the current duties of about 32% and that
is before any exceptions are taken into account.
I understand
that Mr. Ford during his visit to the Summit Meeting in Puerto
Rfco stated that the U. S. should shoot for a target cut of 35%
of the current tariffs of our EC trading partners.
Since
Mr. Ford was referring to a cut after exceptions are taken into
account, you can see this leaves a wide gap for our negotiators
to close.
As to the timing of the final decision on the tariff formula,
you are aware that the Swedes have recently settled their elec­
tions.
Soon it will be the West Germans and the Japanese. At
the first of this coming year, there will be a replacement of
eight of the nine EC Ministers in Brussels. All of this, cou­
pled with our own elections in November, leads your Committee
to the conclusion that not only will there be an agreement on
the formula, but, also, no serious negotiations will begin
before early to mid-1977 at best.
CMA 037086

government continues, however, to let us know that things are
indeed busy in Geneva with various Multilateral Trade Negotia­
tion (MTN) subgroups at work hammering out preliminary details.
These subgroups have been meeting with our trading partners in
an effort to come to a mutual understanding on how to treat
such matters as: subsidies, countervailing duties, access to
supply* government procurement, standards and codes, GATT re­
form, and the very important subject of non-tariff barriers.
Due to a wide variety of non-tariff barriers currently employ­
ed, it is thought by many that the settlement of this matter is
more critical than the agreement upon a tariff formula.
ISAc-5,
six members of whom are from the MCA International Trade Com­
mittee, are providing U. S. chemical industry overviews on how
we wish these matters to be handled when negotiations do finally
take place.
This leads me into the subject of how ISAC-5 is progressing. At
our meeting some two weeks ago in Washington, we were told by
repr sentatives of the Department of Commerce, as well as the
Office of Special Trade Representative, that ISAC-5 was better
prepared and better organized than any of the remaining 25 ISACs.
This praise by the government is not meant to imply that we nec­
essarily expect to do better in the negotiations than we did in
the Kennedy Round nor better than any of the other idustries of
the United States, but we do want you to know that we see no
reason for government to eventually point the finger at our in­
dustry and tell us that we failed in doing our homework.
There still remains an inadequate two-way flow of information
in these large and complex government private sector committee
structures. At the same time, it is agreed that they are func­
tioning better than they were at the start.
STR continues to
tell us that they are determined to further improve the ISAC
system and that the outcome of the negotiations will depend, to
a great extent, on just how well we have prepared the Geneva
negotiators, which in turn, is saying just how well the ISAC
functioned.
CMA 037087
4
Due to the complexity of the chemical industry, we were forced
in ISAC-5 to fragment into seven subcommittees which are;
Benzenoid Intermediates, Pigments, Fertilizers, Pesticides,
Inorganics, Miscellaneous Organics, and Dyestuffs.
The full
ISAC-5 Committee is expected to meet four times this year, while
the subgroups will meet at least that many times. At the pre­
sent time, we are hard at work trying to determine just which
chemical products would be most sensitive to tariff cuts.
This
is the exceptions list.
There is one key area that I solicit
the help of those of you present today in this respect, and
that is in the field of inorganic products.
More input into
our committee is definitely required by industry to be sure
that correct decisions by ISAC-5 members are being made.
This
input, as it pertains to sensitivity, should be made directly
to the Department of Commerce, and the appropriate address is
given in the written report of these remarks.
Industry Consultation Policy Staff, Department of Commerce,
Washington, D. C.
20230
As ISAC-5 works with this exceptions list and brings it to a
conclusion, we are informed by government that our next step
will be one of being certain that we can ultimately provide the
necessary justification for our decisions.
By utilization of a
checklist, we are preparing ourselves to address these questions
from government. We are also establishing priorities within the
xceptions list itself.
Thus, the critical area for our indus­
try will probably reside in the rules for determining exception^,
and the ultimate ability of our negotiators to obtain exceptions
for the import sensitive products whether it is on a multilateral
or bilateral basis.
In addition to this work on exceptions, we continue to press
government for the conversion of our specific and compound
duties to an ad valorem basis, the selection of the base year
being the critical matter.
Some base year has to be agreed
upon in order to provide a starting point for the calculation
of the value of the concessions to be negotiated.
This is more
important for the chemical industry than perhaps any other due
to the fact that we have such a large number of specific and
compound duties and to the sharp rises in the chemical prices
over the last several years.
CMA 037088
r
Finally* I wish to report that Dr. Dawson, in the capacity of
the Chemical Industry Trade Advisor, has reactivated the
Technical Advisory Committee. We will have our first meeting
tomorrow in New York City.
Dr. Dawson has restructured this
Committee, and it is planned that this is yet another way that
oar industry can be sure of addressing all agencies of our
government with uniform voice.
In addition to MCA; DCMA, SOCMA,
spX, and various members of ISAC-5 will all be brought together
tomorrow under one committee.
This organization is not restrict­
ed as is the ISAC program in that two-way communication is pos­
sible.
One item that was not included in my outline that may be of in­
terest to you. Gentlemen, deals with a recent survey sent to
the chemical industry by the Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
in conjunction with the U. S. Department of Labor.
Due to the
detail that the survey called for, an overwhelming number of
U. S.-based chemical companies have declined to respond.
^In conclusion, within the next 12 months, there is a reasonable
chance that our negotiators will begin a serious dialogue with
There continues to be a serious need for
continued industry input to insure we take advantage of all
available opportunities.

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
E. E. CHRISTOFANO, CHAIRMAN
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH COMMITTEE
OCTOBER 12, 1976
Since my last report to the Board in February 1976, rep­
resentatives of the Occupational Health Committee testified
on behalf of MCA before the Subcommittee on Manpower and Housing
of the House of Representatives committee on Government Operations
at an oversight hearing on the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), before the National Academy of Sciences
committee on Public Information in the Prevention of Occupational
cancer and met with Dr. Morton Corn, the Assistant Secretary
of Labor. An underlying theme of all three appearances was
that r gulation of each and every chemical in the work environ­
ment under separate rules is unworkable,
instead it was urged
|that entire sectors of the chemical industry be covered by
Simple guidelines enforced by inspectors experienced in that
special industry.
Industries, such as papermaking, pesticide
manufacture, printing ink and petroleum refining were mentioned
as examples where such regulation would be appropriate.
, Recently the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) and OSHA have begun to prepare industry­
wide guidelines on pesticide manufacture and printing ink for­
mulation. Furthermore, at a recent NIOSH Workshop on Regulation
of Pesticides in the Workplace, Mr. Steven Wodka, Legislative
Assistant for The Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers suggested an
approach to worker health protection similar to the views
expressed previously at the hearing and meetings just mentioned.
Encouraged by the acceptance being gained for the idea
of preparing regulations on an industry-by-industry basis, the
committee intends to further pursue its attempts at simplifying
rules by working with the agencies involved.
The issue of identification of all chemicals including
trade name products entering the workplace surfaced at the
Congressional Oversight Hearing mentioned earlier. At that
time the widespread practices among chemical manufacturers
Nre disclosed whereby products are identified only by trade
name with inadequate instructions for safe handling on the
I
CMA 037090
label. We predict that complete disclosure of the composition
of trade name products will become a major effort by OSHA in
the next year or two.
Recently the Committee sponsored the preparation of an
article by Dr. w. R. Gaffey, a leading epidemiologist, which
provides guidance in how to collect health and employment data,
including exposure information, that will be meaningful and
adequate for future epidemiological studies.
To extend such
studies across the entire petrochemical industry, we hope to
begin a joint mortality study soon with the American Petroleum
Institute.
At this time the Committee is beginning a feasibility
study (in conjunction with the American Petroleum Institute)
on the gathering and examination of mortality statistics among
petrochemical workers.
Since the Committee believes that
worker health experience will remain topical over the next
.several years, it is also investigating a tumor registry among
MCA member companies to be maintained by a contractor.
It is
expected that budget requests for these two activities will
,be firm by January 1977.

CMA REDACTION DOCUMENTS
VOLUME 4
37096 - 37464
11/22/76 (CMA 12581-12582 and 37097 - 37132) - CMA Board of
Directors Meeting Minutes.
CMA concealed the report of its director of government relations
(37100 and 37112-118), describing the "important new laws" passed at the
end of the 1976 second legislative session, including:
"The Toxic Substances Control Act (PL 94-469), finally became the
law after five years of deliberation and controversy, thus establishing Federal
controls over the manufacturer, distribution and use of chemicals." (CMA
37112), discussing bills which didn't pass but which were "likely to surface
again," including: "A bill to provide stricter regulations of lobbying...;
Common Cause is a strong advocate, while Nader groups and the AFL-CIO
supported only the House version..." CMA concealed the "apprehension" of
"business" that "dues paid to trade associations by corporate members could
be subject to public disclosure under some concepts." CMA concealed its
discussion of the failure of the Clean Act Amendments whose filibuster
Senator Musky blamed on the auto industry. The CMA concealed its
discussion of "Industrial Organization, the so-called Hart Bill" who sponsors
retirees and which "singles out chemicals manufacturing and other industry
for possible breakup, creates a special commission to make divestiture
investigations and a special court to compel dismantling." (CMA 37113).
CMA concealed its having reported the failure of bills which would have
provided for "the outlawing of corporate bribes to foreign officials" and
proposals "to create a new consumer protection agency," expand the FTC,
CMA concealed its description of Jimmy Carter as "an anti­
establishment candidate for nearly two years" but that "Jimmy Carter now IS
the establishment." (CMA 37114), The CMA concealed its statement that
Carter "is now confronted with the dilemma of some delicacy: How to begin
to direct and to motivate the people and the mechanisms he as so recently
and soundly castigated." (CMA 37115).
The CMA concealed its discussion of "congressional leaders who"
have "obviously enjoyed the independence and status which the years of
confrontation [during the 'stalemate government' of Presidents Nixon and
Ford] have produced." (CMA 3711 5). These legislatures simply "covet their
independence of action" and consider their "important role" as being nothing
more than "punishing one President" or "making his successor appear
ineffectual..." Longtime Carter watchers point out that "he adopted a tough,
no compromise attitude towards the Georgia legislature during his term as
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
Governor." (CMA 37115). CMA concealed its belief that "the incoming
President...would apparently retain the present non-degradation concepts of
the Clean Air Act" and "has called for stricter enforcement of water pollution
control laws and evidently will oppose efforts to weaken Federal Water
Pollution Control Act." (CMA 37116).
CMA concealed the report of its Chemical Packaging Committee (and
its existence) (CMA 37119-123): "Times have changed! Just a few years
ago, chemical packaging engineers might be concentrating on the steel
thickness of a drum for solvents...," etc., but "today, he must also know
about the Transportation Safety Act of 1974, consolidation of DOT
Regulations... and, looking to the future, regulations on solid waste deposal
and carcinogens." And why have times changed so? "We believe the most
important factor is the concern on the part of both private and public sectors
for greater safety in the packaging, transportation, and distribution of
hazardous materials."
CMA concealed its discussion of DOT recognition of "cost/benefit" it
"considers in any reviews of package regulation changes. Packaging is seen
as a cost item in our industry." (CMA 37120). The CMA concealed the fact
its Packaging Committee "together with the Transportation Equipment and
Transportation and Distribution Committees, sponsors symposium on
hazardous materials regulations with over 1100 attendees from all concerned
shipper and carriers groups..." Other evidence indicates the CMA's
preference for regulation by DOT. CMA concealed "DOT has already
indicated that they have underdevelopment regulations applying to the proper
packaging and transportation of health products such as carcinogens,
munegions?? and teartatogens." (CMA 37122).
CMA concealed its Chemical Packaging Committees' reference to its
"responsibility...to assist the chemical industry to meet all legal requirements
while maintaining a low-risk position in transportation with proper
cost/benefit consideration. And we intend to make known the position or
industry on legislative and regulatory matters." (CMA 37122).
Consistent with its systematic redaction of similar reports which CMA,
despite repeated orders of the court thinks it has a right to "redact" as "nonresponsive" or "unlikely to lead to the discovery of relevant evidence, here
again CMA conceals the Public Relations Committees' report to the board of
directors. Indeed, the very existence of the Public Relations Committee was
systematically concealed by CMA in its first three document production.
Plaintiffs allege that the "scientific" efforts conducted by the CMA
were adjuncts to its overall public relations efforts: CMA redacted as
irrelevant its goal for its previous year (one of two):
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
"That we should establish closer relationships with other functional
areas of CMA so a more meaningful contribution to the industry total
communications could be made. These things have been done. The assaults
on the chemical industry by media and government in the past twelve
months have made it imperative." (CMA 37124). There is a reference to
the activities of that committee Chemical Regulations Advisory Committee
(CRAC) "an opportunity to participate in Dr. Heckert's SPECIAL COMMITTEE
ON TOXIC LEGISLATION" which CMA says "demonstrated what can be
accomplished through interaction of functions when proper leadership is
provided." [I don't know what this means exactly though. We do know that
the beginning of this committee (whose existence concealed by CMA) began
"about eighteen months ago" and this would have been around the time of
the Tenneco/SPI "jurisdictional dispute" of the spring of 1975.] It was
"about eighteen months ago" that the "Public Relation Committee stepped
up its practice of meeting with the leadership of certain other functional
committees, particularly Government Relations, Technical and Legal
Advisory." The Technical Group would have included the vinyl panel and the
link with the vinyl panel and it begins with Tenneco, who shared the SPI's
similar committee. The plaintiffs allege that the CMA's "scientific" and
public relations activities are intertwined and CMA has redacted this
statement as "proof that joint committee action can get things done...:
...What we have found is that we can work together - that we have a
common purpose and pursuit. We have agreed upon issues that should the
greatest concern of the association [referring to the CMA generally and the
"joint committees" such as those discussed here.]" These are human health
and the environment, and the increasing government constraints which he
wrote industry management of its resources.
CMA concealed specific references to liaisons between its Public
Relations Committee and its Air Quality Committee, its Occupational Health
Committee, its Government Relations Committee, as well as its Legal
Advisory and Chemical Relations Advisory Committee. (CMA 37124). CMA
concealed that "the Air Quality Committee, for example, will provide facts on
what the chemical industry has done about air pollution, and provide the
industry position on current legislative and regulatory matters in active
collaboration with the Public Relations Committee." This document spells
out that "members of the [technical] task force which service coordinators of
the [public relations] project, recruit the best possible spokesman from
MCA's membership and arrange platforms in leading cities where maximum
speaker [in accordance with this plan for "joint committee action" with the
Public Relations Committee] would develop his topic in his own way,
weaving in the MCA-developed material at will." The type of spokesman we
have in mind are you gentlemen, the directors of MCA, supported by other
chief executive officers not present today. (CMA 37125).
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
The CMA concealed its discussion of the advantages of its plan to
interject the Public Relations Committee into actively resolve with other
committees: "The short range [advantage] is obvious—to gain some badly
needed statements of the chemical industry point of view and various media.
The longer range advantage will be gained as we found as we build up this
corps of spokesman. MCA has a constant need for industry experts who can
provide statements and can make appearances on relevantly short notice..."
For the industry to provide "news media" with 'the other sides' position
when the story [relating to, say, air quality, etc.] is breaking." The CMA
concealed its goal as to provide, al carte, experts to furnish "the other sides"
position anytime there is a "whole sordid story" to tell which the chemical
industry needs to come up with "the other side" with the assistance of the
CMA's Public Relations Committee. (CMA 37125).
CMA concealed that its leading environmental "Journal ChemEcology"
was, in fact, the creature of the CMA's Public Relations Committee whose
express purpose was to "expand further its coverage of member companies
success stories in the areas of environment and toxic substances." (CMA
37126).
CMA concealed its "three-times-a-year CHEMICAL ISSUES AND
COMMENTARY" which is described as a "survey of member companies" by
the CMA's Public Relations Committee in order "to identify emerging issues"
and which "practice goes back to 1973, when we began polling people
participating in MCA activities in six companies and the professional staff of
MCA..." but which has "now grown to nineteen companies and MCA with
over 400 respondents." MCA has consistently concealed all references to
and any documents generated as the result of the surveys. It is not
believable such surveys, especially in the 1973-74 era would not contain
responsive information.
Consistent with its systematic practice, CMA concealed the CMA staff
report which includes a report from the chairman of its Occupational Health
Committee that the director of OSHA had recently told him OSHA "would
welcome industry input early in the development of any proposed standard....
Information desired includes toxicological work place exposure data on
chemicals to be regulated, which would become part of the pertinent
record." (CMA 37131), which references to CMA sponsored TSCA seminars,
its sponsorship of "a symposium entitled the 'Approaching Toxic Era' in
Houston, November 11th, (CMA 37132). "MCA made public additional
toxicological data relating to the safety of acrylonitrile monitor on November
9th as a result of feeding liquid acrylonitrile to pregnant rats.
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
In a case in which plaintiffs have put the CMA's activities regard SD56 front and center, CMA has redacted relevant references to its having
"suspended circulation of eight chemical safety data sheets pending their
revision to incorporate present knowledge regarding property, characteristics
and handling" and its promise to reissue them someday. During this time
and years to come the CMA continue to "sit on" SD-56, despite its promise
revision as early as 1 974,
1/11/77 (CMA 12583-12584 and 37133-37170) - CMA Board of
Directors Meeting Minutes.
Again, CMA concealed the agenda for its meeting, including both
irrelevant and relevant matter pertaining to its Chemical Relations Advisory
Committee (CRAC), its Industrial Relations Advisory Committee (IRAQ), and
its Legal Advisory Committee. In fact, although CMA has produced at least
three prior versions of the document found at CMA 37134, and after
stipulating that these minutes weren't confidential years ago, and after never
having previously asserted any claim or privilege whatsoever with the regard
to this document, and after having been ordered unequivocally to produce
this document in its entirety at the very latest by the time of the last Case
Master meeting, CMA has redacted a portion of a page two pages behind it
(CMA 37136), as "privileged." Only by reference to the (previously
concealed) agenda, is it possible to even guess this material probably relates
to the Legal Advisory Committee portion of the Board of Director's report.
CMA was ordered to produce in its entirety months if not years ago.
The CMA concealed its discussion of "Corporate Government
Regulations"-effect on innovation and the express desire "without
questioning governmental regulation per say to impose the least possible
burden in accomplishing reasonable objections." CMA considered soliciting
"industry-wide documentation" of this propertied phenomena ("this adverse
effect on innovation phenomena") in the interest of being persuasive..." and
the Board of Director (Mr. Krumrei) was to summit a memorandum on the
subject to the Executive Committee. (CMA 37137).
As usual, CMA concealed all the information on its financial position
including information that will allow one to see the total amount spent on
CMA's entire Technical Panel was a mere $493,836, less than what it spent
on public and government relations, combined and that its final chloride
research received only a small small fraction of its funds. CMA further
concealed the existence of the "plastic scoop" or its financial package. (CMA
37140)
CMA concealed its survey of member companies to obtain "sound
data on chemical manufacturing industry operating costs and investment
Q-.\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
relating to environmental management" which it said was "similar to that
used in 1965" and enabled "direct comparisons with similar information
obtained in surveys "conducted in 1962, 1967, 1972, and 1975." Such
data "has provided MCA with factual information useful in the growing public
debate over costs/benefits. (CMA 37142-37144).
CMA concealed the report of its Food, Drug and Cosmetic Chemicals
Committee (CMA 371 52-153) discussing the U.S. Supreme Court decision
and U.S.V. Park holding that "a corporate executive could be prosecuted
under the criminal provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for
product adulteration, irrespective of his personal ignorance of the situation
causing the adulteration and however remote his involvement in that
situation" which it describes as imposing "absolute criminal liability based
merely upon the responsibility of the individual corporate officers for certain
areas of activity." (CMA 37151).
CMA concealed the report from its Industrial Advisory Committee that
industry might expect "increased future activity" in areas relating to
"occupational safety and equal employment opportunity. Whether you have
unions or not, your employees are becoming aware of their rights in these
areas. If you have unions, many are building technical staffs in the safety,
hygiene and health fields the way their locals have auditing the safety of our
work places. Several companies in our industry have experienced employee
health crisis in the last year, with resulting employee and public relations
problems. We must be prepared to devote more management time and
resources to avoid further employee anxieties about the safety of their work
"Under the best of circumstances, those of us with unions can expect
to hear more about health and safety in future negotiations. Unions are
impatient with OSHA, indeed, the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers is
suing OSHA. We should expect that this impatient will result in a more
direct approach with employers, including demands for Safety Committees
with authority, of union safety consultants at our plants and hire visibility for
such union-oriented medical consultants such as Dr. Irving Selicoff??..."
(CMA 37155). CMA concealed its characterization of OSHA at the time
Morton Corn took office: "The perception of OSHA by the public,
government, and industry at the time was highly unflattering. Morton Corn
has not yet succeeded in reversing, that view but is determined to do so..."
"In short, Morton Corn is making OSHA a new and different kind of
organization..." which is describes as being "on a more professional level"
and "certain period." (CMA 37159)
CMA concealed its "contact with the (ILO) International Labor
Organization through the International Chemicals Employers Labor Relations
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
Committee, which is in effect with need the caucus for ILO purposes of
chemical employers throughout the world." This demonstrates the close
lesion between CMA and its European counterparts. CMA concealed its
"problematical" concern as to whether the U.S. "will remain in the ILO" at all
anymore. It reports that the "Chamber of Commerce, which represents U.S.
management in the ILO, has taken the position that so long as we are
members, we should be fully active, particularly in seeking needed reforms.
This appears to be proper position for MCA to maintain."
CMA concealed CRAC"s solicitation of thirty-five trade organizations
requesting "that MCA presumes the role of coordinator in communicating
with the EPA in respect of regulations implanting the TSCA." (CMA
37168).
CMA apparently deleted exhibit F (37163-167) in its entirety, which
consisted of the report of the CMA Legal Advisory Committee. (CMA
37137).
2/8/77 (CMA 12585-12587 and 37171-37202) - CMA Board of
Directors Meeting Minutes.
CMA concealed its establishment of a "toxic substance's contact
responsible for receiving..." from CRAC, specifically a document of a type
CMA systematically concealed entitled "Toxic Substances Management
Memo" (CMA 37175). CMA concealed its proposed program on the OSHA
regulation of Benzene (CMA 37181-185) and its position on the Toxic
Substances Control Act (CMA 37185) which includes references to the
CMA's "consolidation" organization of other "available data" for presentation
to OSHA, which is "meant to apply primarily to epidemiology studies carried
out in various companies, but not publicized from a concern that they did not
represent a large enough base. Adding them together may provide a more
convincing picture. Again, it was felt that outside expertise should be
sought to consolidate the information." (CMA 37182). This study turns out
to have been conducted by Otto Wong?? and EHA or NCNSR if I not
mistaken. This indicates the reanalysis of the existing studies was the goal
from the outset.
CMA concealed its boasting over the success of its CRAC and
influencing EPA policy, including EPA's "dropping its proposal that impurities
acceptance be reported with annual production volumes." (CMA 37191).
As usual, CMA concealed the report of its Government Relations
Committee, which includes a hilarious recollection of how easy CMA used to
keep bills off the Senate floor or by just leaving town to "tend to my cows"
when "pressure got too great." "I'm not saying this was the way to run the
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
government, but it was the time when businessmen had more influence in
Congress than they have today. But that day went out with one man, one
vote drive that took place more than a decade ago, [the Civil Rights
Movement??], and for a variety of other reasons." CMA also "redacted its
bias recollection of the history of the evolution of union influence, the
influence of television on "selecting and influencing members of Congress, as
well as the rise of public interests groups, " including the Washington offices
of several large companies following World War II: "In the last two decades,
trade associations have become as much of Washington growth phenomena
as government itself." (CMA 37194). CMA redacted its complaints that it
"lacks...grass roots voice" and that many Congress members are telling CMA
that "opinions from the corporate board room no longer carry the weight they
once did. And the vernacular of Capital Hill, they ask us: 'How many votes
have you got?'" The speaker analogizes the tally on election day to the
corporate managers "bottom-line on your corporate financial statement."
What CMA concealed by concealing the origins of its "grass roots
voice on Capital Hill" is that it marshaled two "resources that presently are
largely untapped by business-employees and stock holders" who should
receive "an understanding of the kind of governmental climate that exists for
preservation of private enterprise, and an understanding of how that personal
welfare relates to that of a corporation...," ect. (CMA 371 95). This
contemplates the "mobilization" of employees and stockholders of CMA
members. (CMA 37196). CMA concealed the activities of its Labels and
Precautionary Information Committee (37199-200) including its discussion of
coordination of efforts with the CIA of Britain, testimony before a
Congressional Sub-committee with oversight responsibilities for OSHA with
resulting "opportunity to influence Congressional thinking..." and "wrestling
with the problem of labeling for current chronic hazards, problems involving
carcinogenicity comutinicity??, teragencity, hepatoxicicity, and the difficult
interface between suspected carcinogencity and test animals versus proven
carcinogencity" and the appointment of a sub-committee (including members
of at least three defendants) to "prepare recommendations in this critical
area." The activities of this committee were systematically concealed by
CMA.
CMA concealed its publication by the same Dr. Gaffe who is the
epidemiologist who originally studied the vinyl industry and who
subsequently the vinyl chloride research coordinators: "Regulatory agencies
often use the findings of the epidemiology studies when they make decisions
and issue guidelines. The kinds of epidemiology studies, however, as well as
the data they require in their scope of usefulness, are sometimes not well
understood. On recommendation of the Occupational Health Committee,
therefore, MCA engaged Dr. R. Gaffe to write an explanatory article in
technical language on Occupational Epidemiology" which had been printed as
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
a four-page booklet entitled "A Brief Overview of Occupational
Epidemiology." Dr. Gaffe "was with Equitable Environmental Health, Inc.,
when engaged to write the article" but is now at Standford Research
Institute. (CMA 37202). CMA subsequently other references to this paper.
3/8/77 (CMA 12588-12589 and 37203-37260) - CMA Board of
Directors Meeting Minutes.
CMA concealed its board of director's "resolution on public interests
law firms" (CMA 37206 and 37212-213) which expressly endorses the
"National Legal Center for the Public Interest" which it says is dedicated to
"traditional concepts of private property and competition merit accuracy."
These firms were formed as a direct result "public interest law firms" such
Ralph Nader Possessive Public Citizen Litigation Groups, National Resources
Defense Council, and Searra Club Legal Defense Fund "employing 300 full­
time lawyers" with budgets exceeding $10,000,000 a year. The Specific
Legal Foundation (SLF) was established in 1973, in Sacramento, CA, to
counteract the activities of the above firms by supporting the free enterprise
system and traditional concepts of private property and competition. It has
had many successes. The National Legal Center for the Public Interest was
established in Washington, D.C., in 1975 with "four principle objections:"
(1) To help establish independent regional legal foundations dedicated to a
balanced view of the role of law in achieving economic and social progress
[i.e. again it]; (2) To research national legal issues from a litigation point of
view and develop strategies to achieve the foundations' [?] objectives...; (3)
To act as a resource center regional litigation foundations' in obtaining
qualified researchers and experts..."; and (4) To identify legislative,
administrative and juridical trends likely to result in future litigation."
Under the auspices of the MLCCPI, many other regional foundations
have been organized, patterned after the four-runner PLF. "These
foundations will support in the courts the tenets of free enterprise which
nobody else appears to be doing in the area of public interest law."
CMA concealed the Legal Advisory Committee's endorsement of the
activities of these organizations and adopted an attached resolution of
endorsement.
CMA, who can't seem to find the secrecy agreements its solicited and
other relevant documents concealed the existence of its Technical
Information Retrieval Committee with Gulf Oil Chemicals Corporation as Vice
Chairman. (CMA 37214).
CMA concealed its staff report concerning MCA testimony before the
National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health (NACOSH)
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
"on regulations on worker exposure to suspected chemical carcinogens"
proposed by OSHA with areas of particular concern including: "For one,
OSHA is considering only inherent toxic properties and ignoring dosage,
duration and time of exposure in interaction with other substances" and
urging NACOSH "to deliberate at great length" over a definition of a
The CMA concealed its "go slow" approach to FDA regulations for
good laboratory practices. (CMA 37216). The continuous mechanism of the
Technical Publications Program has resulted in the recent suspension from
circulation of five Chemical Safety Data Sheets on trychloride, ethyline,
perchlorine ethyline, dimethyl sulfate, acrylontrile and napthalene since the
first notification of suspensions in November, 1976, and that its Chemical
Safety Data Sheets on arsenic, tryoxide, chlorine, morihydride, zirconium,
and afnium powder have been withdrawn permanently. The CMA concealed
its seminar on corporate readiness for compliance with TOSCA attended by
approximately 500. (CMA 37217).
4/12/77 - (CMA 12590-12592 and 37219-37260) - MCA Board of
Directors Meeting Minutes.
CMA concealed existence and activities of its various committees,
including its Air Quality Committee, its Government Relations Committees,
and its Political Action Committee: "Dr. Barnes spoke of his company's
experience relating to 1 500 of their employees participating in seven Political
Action Committees distributed regionally around the country. He expressed
the opinion that this had been successful effort in support of the free
enterprise system, and offered to furnish others with information on Dow's
approach" to PACS. (CMA 37222).
CMA concealed the report of its Air Quality Committee including the
observation that "we are on strong technical ground in saying that oxidant is
relatively insensitive to changes in hydrocarbons and that hydrocarbons can
not be controlled sufficiently in most places to obtain the oxidant's standard.
Los Angeles is a prime example."
MCA concealed that it had "been most active in testifying, writing and
visiting Congressmen and meeting with their staffs to seek all the
amendments proposed in Mr. Polzer's testimony." (CMA 37240).
The CMA concealed its discussion of the EPA Study of Synthetic
Organic Chemical Industry and CMA's coordination with SOCMA with regard
to a total of about forty chemicals: "EPA states that synthetic organic
chemicals contributed 10% of the total hydrocarbon emissions from
stationary sources. They state that control hinges primarily on proper plant
Q:\wp51\Mollie\37096-37464
design in operation that will require depth of knowledge by EPA of our
operations that is unprecedented."
CMA concealed its discussion of "strong criticism against EPA" by the
EDF that benzene was a significant hazard and carcinogen, resulting in the
"emergency" which resulted in the development of "a special MCA task
group to handle this item alone." However, "since this is a single product,
response to EPA is being made on an individual company basis [as if MCA
were not coordinating the violation of the anti-trustl. Eleven MCA member
companies are participating. (CMA 37241).
The CMA concealed the existence of the Foster D. Snell, Inc.
Hydrocarbon Control Cost Study and resulting questionnaire it was funding:
"We've never attempted anything to this depth before, but then, we've never
faced $5-$15 billion investment costs for control of a single class of pollution
before..." He says the study was "an eye-opener" and "will show we
discharge a greater tonnage of hydrocarbon than we thought; that we do not
have a good estimate on emissions on a number of sources; that likely the
majority of our total poundage emissions derive from only a fraction of our
total sources." The CMA has determined that information such as this is not
likely to lead to discoverable evidence in this case, indicating a willful
ignorance of plaintiff's pleadings and discovery. (CMA 37241).
CMA conceals the was its Air Quality Committee orders up a
"Scientific" Committee requiring "medical epidemiology input" as if it were a
peca?? "EPA is revising the six existing air qualities standards and will be
adding new ones. Our Committee will need medical epidemiology input if we
are to react.. Unless you object, my intention of a nucleus medical of
representation from your companies to determine the feasibility of a rebuttal.
A second item needing medical input is an advice on the concentrations of
the community environment that are considered safe for all of our chemicals.
The current procedure is to use the OSHA standards and arbitrarily take a
percentage of them and call this safe for the public. We will have to do
better than this for benzene, achrylinitride and eventually all the rest. We
would plan to use your a forementioned medical representatives to guide
committees in this crucial area also. The third item is that relatively little
attention has been paid by control agencies to our emissions during start-up
and shut-downs, emergency releases, and fugitive losses. Various estimates
indicate that they may be as large as our normal emissions and control
agencies are starting to note this." (CMA 37242). This is relevant and
should not have been concealed.
Compare CMA 12592 with, say, 37240-242. The redacted material
makes sense and the material CMA chose to produce, in the context it
shows to produce it, only created more questions than it answered.
Q:\wp51\Mollie\37096-37464
Plaintiffs do not point to this as a particularly "egregious" deletion. On the
other hand, it is as good as an example as any of the CMA's abuse of its
right to redact relevant information.
CMA concealed the reference to the board "adding a general council to
the MCA staff. Despite the strength of the present staff support, we
welcome this and, being pushy, hope the time will come when the
environmental lawyer is also hired." (CMA 37243).
In a similar vein, CMA concealed its Water Resources Committees'
references to the quality of the "legal services to environmental committees:
"In which the Committee wished to point out that for some time, the Water
Resources Committee has been concerned about the uncertainty and
irregularity of the legal council it received in the course of its business. It is
particularly important that an attorney familiar with environmental law review
comments that are prepared by an EPA Technical Committee for submittal to
CMA in response to regulatory proposals are in discussion of EPA's program
strategies. Several years ago, in an attempt to provide such service, the
MCA Board authorized the establishment of the Joint Subcommittee of the
Environment Law (JSEL)..." ...However, other demand member companies'
attorneys time, this does not resolve the problem..." (CMA 37252). CMA
concealed the concern of its Water Resources Committee with a level of
funding for its scientific studies (they are practically begging for $15,000.)
CMA concealed its description of the EPA administrator Russell Train
as having "a strong environmentalist leaning which affected agency policy,
although in Rein by the recognition of economic realities by others in the Ford
and Nixon administrations. We fear that there may not be an equal
restraining influence on President Carter..." (CMA 37255).
CMA concealed its staffs reports boasting of the "conspicuous role" it
played in responding to EPA's strategy document "assessment and control of
chemical problems" at public meetings attended by 400 participants, nearly
all representatives of industry, in Washington, on March 22-23." (CMA
37256). CMA concealed that "MCA has emphasized again the chemical
long-standing position that some provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1970 are
'rapidly leading our nation to untimely and overly restrictive limitations on
industrial strength' and George Polzer again presented the association views
before a Congressional unit, this time on March 11th to members of the
Subcommittee of Environment on the Health State and Foreign Commerce
Committee..." (CMA???) Considering amendments to the Clean Air Act of
1970. George Polzer has presented testimony "before the Senate in
February." [Who is this George Polzer, who has "presented the associations'
views" on the amendments to the CAA of 1970.] (CMA 37257).
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
MCA "expressed concern...that naming certain contaminants in the bill
effectively judges the need for controls and that 'all elements of doubt will
be resolved in favor of control, whether or not hearings and studies
demonstrate an affirmative need for them." (CMA 37257).
CMA endorsed the TASA language "will not cause or significantly
contribute an unreasonable risk to public health" ..."regarding zero risks and
risks/benefit." CMA says it is "less than 1-8th of the problem" caused by
hydrocarbon emissions, as opposed to "motor vehicles and fuel marketing."
"Two percent additional investment by 1990" would not be intolerable."
CMA doesn't support the "Rooney Amendment" which place
"primarily responsibility on the state for granting variances for expansion or
new construction in areas where the national standard is being exceeded"
because MCA felt "the amendment could be interpreted as requiring trade­
offs." (CMA 37258). CMA announced on April 5th, supplementing it
2/17/77 testimony before the NAC on OSHA, "MCA said the chemical
industry is dedicated to protecting its workers from known hazards. On the
other hand, we held that occupational cancer 'is not the major public health
spectre some have suggested.' 'Cancer is a complex subject,' we pointed
out. 'Qualified experts see the subject in perspective, and through
perspective we believe the problem and its reduction can be addressed
CMA wants "a committee of cancer experts" to study the "available
facts" and "scientific/medical guidelines for use by OSHA in this area"
composed from academia, industry, labor, toxicology groups and
government.
CMA opposed generally applicable regulations and wants its panel of
"qualified experts." "Each chemical must be addressed on a case-by-case
The third thing the CMA recommended that OSHA include in "a new
proposal for guidelines regulating carcinogens in the work place" was the use
of "performance rather than specific routes to desired performance," i.e. if
performance standards. (CMA 37258).
MCA's support for "OSHA's 'ABC' Plan for Work Place Safety" which
would use incentives on grade "B" companies and concentrate their
enforcement efforts on grade "A" companies, consisting of those found to
have ineffective programs." (CMA 37259).

5/10/77 - (CMA 12593-12594 and 37262-37296) - MCA Board of
Directors Meeting Minutes.
(Last time "CMA concealed" is used unless I specifically say it)
CMA concealed TASA implantation Richard E. Heckert, the Senior
Advisor to the Executive Committee on TASA. Heckert was to meet with
ERA administrator Costle to discuss the "tendency to over-regulate ...as well
as to emphasize the limited availability of testing facilities to conduct
toxicological evaluation." (CMA 37265).
CMA concealed their report of their director on Government Relations.
(CMA 37265 and 37276-285): "Heated battles...took place in both House
and Senate over rules which will apply to the expansion of industrial facilities
in areas where air quality does not meet national health standards." CMA
refers to its "effort to set aside the EPA 'trade off policy,' a broadly
supported business effort...mounted in both committees" of the House and
Senate which were considering those rules. (CMA 37283).
"Concern was expressed by subcommittee members (Senate
Commerce Subcommittee on Science) that Costle has not requested
sufficient funding to properly administer the law..." In his request to the
appropriation authorizations on EPA (29 million for 1978 and 50 million for
1979), prior to having left his position in the EPA, the previous EPA
Administrator Tran has asked for 52 million for 1978 instead of 29 million.
CMA discusses the proposed amendment to TSCA to establish Toxic
Substances Injury Assistance Act whose sponsor (Senator Griffin) feels
"...that the Federal and State levels of governments should respond to
chemical contamination as much as they do in cases of natural disasters.
However, Costle in the Environmental Organization supported a concept of
involving funds contributed by the manufacturers." CMA does not say
whether it opposed or supported this legislature. (CMA 37284).
The Insurance Committee reported to the board that "to put it simply,
The Liability Market is in a state of utter chaos..." CMA suggests "giving
serious consideration to assuming more of the risks, coupled with 'in-house'
risk management discipline procedures to control losses. The name of the
game continues to be loss prevention." (CMA 37286).
The chairman of the Insurance Committee says he is "hopeful that
CMA will be able to influence legislature to the benefit of the chemical
industry" with regard to product liability "legislative reform" activities. (CMA
37287)
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
The CMA refers to its "finalization of a Loss Data Bank" which the
Insurance Committee has been creating for the last five years and which
contain "statistics and pertinent information on property losses." ...Under
stewardship of MCA to provide uniformity of reporting in confidentiality...
CMA concealed its staff report, including the reference to its principle
concern: "Improved definition and interpretation of air quality standards,
limits on industrious expansion in areas failing to obtain health standards, no­
growth implications of federally-enforced policy of non-deterioration, and
relief from certain flexible statutory compliance deadlines." The Bentsen
Amendment would allow exceptions in non-attainment areas "under certain
conditions." (CMA 37295). The CMA learns that OSHA has announced a
one ppm ETS, down 10 eight-hour TWA, lowering the ceiling from 25 to 5
ppm eliminating "the peak level of 50 ppm for a 1 5 minute period during the
eight-hour day" under the prior standard. (CMA 37295). Dr. Bingham
promised work on developing a permanent standard which would be
complete in six months. (CMA 37295).
CMA concealed that it "arranged 56 television interviews and 72
radios interviews with 16 member companies' representatives at this
American Women in Radio and Television Convention..." and "interviewed
ten industry representatives," and sent 1000 copies "of these interviews...to
extension home economists around the country for use on their local radio
37295). Ninety-three percent of the 600 people attending the American
Women in Radio and Television Convention "visited MCA's
suite...Convention attendees in our suite was the most popular of all." (CMA
37295).
CMA concealed its discussion of "suggestion made some months ago
that consideration be given to merging SOCMA (Society of Organic's
Chemicals Manufacturer Association), identified in plaintiffs discovery into
MCA. This matter having been studied jointly by the MCA Executive
Committee and SOCMA Board, a merger has been abandoned for the
present. Instead, closer liaisons is to be maintained through cross-visitation
meetings of the official bodies of the two organizations." (CMA 37265).
William J. Driver discussed his meeting with a CEFIC Delegation ("European
Council of Chemicals Manufacturers Federations") and discussions included
"governmental regulation of air and water pollution control and toxic
CMA again concealed any reference to its environmental management
survey, here, in fact, the response to the request for the survey information

has been "disappointing" with only 89 companies submitting data which
compared to 1 30 "in a similar survey two years ago" [in which survey results
have also been concealed]. (CMA 37266).
CMA concealed its discussion of "OSHA Cancer Policy Proposal" and
MCA's having written the NAS on OSH "urging the establishment of a
Review Committee of cancer experts from academia, government, labor,
toxicology, and industry groups..."
6/8/77 - (CMA 12595-12596 and 37298-37307 - MCA Board of Directors
Meeting Minutes.
CMA concealed the meeting schedule of its Board of Directors of
1977-78, which refers to meetings every month except July and August
with all meetings taking place in Washington, D.C., except three in exotic
locations. (CMA 37300). CMA concealed its liaison with SOCMA and the
fact that the E.P. Blanchard, the President of SOCMA, was in attendance in
the meeting and that the CMA's George F. Polzer reported on his attendance
at recent SOCMA board meetings and having "responded enthusiastically,
saying that closer liaisons should identify opportunities for complimentary
action and that he would be pleased to continue to represent MCA and
fostering this relationship." (CMA 37300).
CMA concealed the fact that virtually all its "non-budgeted funds and
meetings" involved vinyl chloride or other chlorinated hydrocarbon research
(with a few exceptions, like phosgene, fluorocarbons, and benzene.) (CMA
37303). The second version (July, 1996) or CMA 12596)
MCA moved to intervene in the API's suit requesting review of
OSHA's ETS for benzene issued April 29th. (CMA 37307).
9/13/77 (CMA 12597-12598 and 37309-37332)- MCA Board of Directors
Meeting Minutes.
CMA concealed its policy on lobbying reform (CMA 37311 and
37320) which "would require substantial changes in reporting, record
keeping and disclosures in funding sources in such a manner as to raise
serious questions for trade associations and their members." (CMA 37320).
The CMA wants to make sure that any new legislature at least it is limited to
Congress and not to the Executive Branch or "grass-roots" lobbying activities
and specifically that it "not require the compulsory disclosure of trade
association membership and dues information..." (CMA 37320). [Of course,
CMA would budget huge amounts of money to various public relations and
scientific efforts as well as direct lobbying activities.]
Q:\wp51\Mollie\37096-37464
CMA concealed the existence of its Chemical Regulation Advisory
Committee, Industrial Relations Advisory Committee, Insurance Committee,
and Public Relations Committee (CMA 37319). This is not an isolated
incident. The CMA consistently concealed every reference to these
committees and their activities throughout the documents it produced in this
case.
The CMA concealed the report of its Government Relations Committee
(CMA 37321-326), including its reference to proposed labor reform bills,
"LOBBYING REFORM BILLS, WHICH COULD SHARPLY AFFECT THE
BUSINESS COMMUNITY..." (emphasis in the original.)
CMA concealed its alliance with the NAM and the United States
Chamber of Commerce in "rallying to seek enactment of legislation which
would correct the inadequacies of the present lobbying laws without placing
the reasonable constraints and burdensome requirements on organizations
and individuals wishing to communicate with members of Congress..." The
The CMA concealed the fact that the president (here, William J.
Driver) of the CMA may himself "approve" studies which are "conducted
under the subscribed special projects program being administrated by MCA."
Here, no VCM related project was discussed (although an EDC project is
discussed); however, because of the systematic manner CMA redacted
relevant information which would allow a reader to understand the context of
"unredacted information," unless I read CMA 37327 or any similar staff
report. They all were redacted of the information which reveals this relevant
information as to how "special projects program" such as the MCA
administered vinyl projects operate, specifically the vinyl panel. The CMA
concealed its president's report of CMA's refinement of its "views on
confidentiality as this issue is involved in Section 8" of TASA and its
reference to a "task force composed of members of the Chemical Regulations
Advisory and Technical Information Retrieval Committees" which would
address the confidentiality" issues, including simply using "total volume of
production" as "acceptable" method of "inventory reporting," etc.
CMA concealed its having told the EPA considering inadequate

CMA concealed the staff report of its president. (CMA 37351-355).
CMA concealed its submission of a "long document" to OSHA on

the proposed conclusion that the health and safety of employees will be
enhanced by changing the standard from 10 ppm/25ppm to 1ppm/5ppm"
and if there is "no evidence that leukemia has resulted from exposure to
benzene at the current concentration limits.." With the regulations described
as representing "an intolerable misallocation of economic resources" which
"would not improve safety in the work place, but would merely elevate a
declaration of policy to a position superior to a scientific evidence which

CMA concealed MCA's having "protested to the Environmental
Protection Agency the efforts to limit the emissions of vinyl chloride even
further are unreasonable" and refers specifically to a letter written by Driver

a few years later) reports that more than 1 50 people took part in MCA's
annual 'workshop on safety and health in the chemical industry' in New
Orleans last month." (CMA 37354). CMA also concealed that Dr. Bingham,
Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health, Department of
Labor, would speak at the Chemical Forum on 11/1/77 at Washington Hilton.

11/21/77 (CMA 12601-12602 and 37356-37383) - CMA Board of Directors
Meeting Minutes.
CMA concealed the participation of SOCMA (E.P. Blanchard, E.l. du
CMA concealed the proposed rules of organization and procedure for
the Chemical Regulations Advisory Committee (CRAC). (CMA 37359).
Although CMA agreed that these minutes were not confidential years
ago, it continues to defy the court's orders not to redact irrelevant
information from responsive documents, here, a large section of the
discussion of the Technical and Functional Committee reports it received
[and which are not attached (and which CMA has not produced anyway),
including technical committees on such matters as air quality, chemical
packaging, education activities, government relations, insurance, labels and
precautionary information, etc.] (CMA 37359-360).
CMA concealed its discussion of its "Risks/Benefit Analysis" which
"highlighted carcinogencity as the crucial current problem relating to
risk/benefit analysis, with resolution of the threshold concept being vital for
understanding." (CMA 37361).
CMA concealed the fact that what later came to be known as the
American Industrial Health Council (AIHC) began its existence as an "inter­
industry task group for a rational cancer policy" and that the chairman of this
committee was on the CMA Board of Directors. (CMA 37362). The purpose
of AIHC is to "bring rationality to OSH A regulations concerning cancer." The
activities of the AIHC are specifically identified as being the result of "a joint
effort with MCA, SOCMA and other trade associations as well as numerous
individual companies and various industries participating." SOCMA provided
staff support, and the firm Cleary, Gottliebe, Steen, Apersand, and Hamilton
have been retained as legal council. The CMA concealed the "cooperative
and constructive relationship with OSHA." He stressed this following his
discussion of a visit he made to OSHA Administrator Dr. Ula Bingham. (CMA
37362).
The AIHC was charged "to develop a list of suspected commercial
carcinogens" as well as "information that will assist a company to assess the
impact of regulatory action on its own operations, and information that will
help companies to prepare to testify." (CMA 37362).
CMA concealed the report its board of directors received from 104
member companies responding to surveys which indicate product liability "to
be a problem in respect to chemical manufacturing.." but "was not shown
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
to be a major one as it is the case for machinery manufacturers or those
engaged in supplying consumer products." [emphasis supplying] (CMA
37362).
"The Committee is reserving judgment on Workmen's Compensation
Law as the sole remedy since that surely would be very expensive." (CMA
37362).
CMA concealed that its Board of Directors received reports from CUT
(Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology), here represented by "Mr.
Fleming," its Chairman, who introduced Dr. Goldberg, CIIT's president "who
spoke of the Institute's objectives and progress in toxicological testing of
widely distributed basic chemicals, research and test methods in
interpretation of data, and training of toxicologists" and that all this
toxicology testing was "being supported by 29 companies with a three-year
commitment (1978-80) totaling 20 million dollars" and building a staff of 75.
(CMA 37363). Plaintiffs discovery, the various court orders, and plaintiffs
subpoena clearly and specifically requested information with regard to
contacts between CMA and CUT.
CMA concealed that, except for a well-budgeted industry wide
benzene study, the entire budget for CMA Research relates to vinyl or
plastics (BCM, VDC, Styrine, Acryiloniterile, Trichlorethylene, EDC,
Chlorbenzne, Epichilorohydrin, Phthalate, Esters, Epoxy Resins??, and
Titanium Dioxide. CMA 12602, CMA's original production and CMA 37366
CMA also concealed the entire "Plastic's Group Financial Package"
CMA concealed the rules of organization and procedure of CRAC
(CMA 37368-372) which coordinated the activities of various CMA panels
CMA knew plaintiffs knew about. However, CMA knew plaintiffs did not
know about the Chemical Relations Advisory Committee of the CMA (CRAC)
whose stated purposes included advising the board "concerning the testing
and regulatory control of chemicals at the point of manufacturer identified
with potential hazards to health and the environment..." and to "formulate
and advocate chemical industry positions... cooperate with other MCA
committees, and promote exchange of information within the chemical
industry, with trade and professional associations, and with all levels of
government regarding good practices in controlling chemical hazards. (CMA
37368).
CMA concealed that membership in this committee was limited to
candidates whose "duties for his employer... include formulation of policies
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
and direction of programs related to toxic substances control through
research, quality control, product development, occupational environmental
safety or allied function." (CMA 37368).
CMA concealed the existence of the "General Principles Applicable to
the Structure and Operations of Committee" which "prescribes" the
"responsibilities" of the Secretary, the MCA Staff Representative assigned to
each CMA committee. (CMA 37370). CMA still has not produced this
"General Principles" document and, in fact, systematically concealed the
existence of the organizational structure in which the pertinent CMA
activities occurred. The original date of this document appears to have been
March 12, 1963, with subsequent amendments (CMA 37372).
CMA concealed the report of its Government Relations Committee
(CMA 37374-379), including discussions of TSCA amendments with "MCA
activity in this area... under way in the Legal Advisory Subgroup" of CRAC
and that "CRAC intends to prepare a position paper for use on the Hill."
CMA concealed the existence of its Washington Environmental
Coordinating Committee, here being informed of problems of CRAC with
proposed TSCA amendments (CMA 37376).
CMA concealed its staff report (CMA 37380-383), including its
expectation that OSHA would "issue its permanent standard sometime
between Thanksgiving and middle of December" for benzene and its
awareness that EPA, regulating benzene under Section 112 of the Air Quality
Control Act, and that it had issued three documents on Ambient Air
Distribution of Emissions and Risks to Human Health (CMA 37380).
CMA concealed its agreements with the Franklin Institute Research
Laboratories (FIRL) "to provide MCA information necessary for updating
safety data sheets and determining whether, in a particular instance [for
example, SD-56, which despite industry pledge to reissue in 1974 wouldn't
see the light of day for years, if it ever did], a Safety Data Sheet would be
temporarily withdrawn from distribution pending revision..." (CMA 37381)
The CMA recognizes that there is only "approximately 100 chemicals we
have published a safety data sheet" to begin with. (CMA 37381). CMA
concealed the existence of "plastics waste management" it first describes as
having been "published in 1 970" and the existence of "flammability testing
of polymers" whose date is not given (CMA 37381).
CMA concealed very relevant information pertaining to its knowledge
and understanding of "notification of substantial risks under Section 8 (e)" of
TSCA [this is directly relevant to the Buse Audit of IBT discussed at the
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
emergency session of the VCRC in 1980 where Ed Frost discussed CMA
lawyers having "gone through the files" of CMA following discussion of
document which "might sink the CMA."] CMA's position as the concealed
portion reveals it expressed to EPA was that Section 8 (e) of TSCA will
cause inefficient over reporting [!] of information to the agency and cause
serious internal difficulties for the chemical industry...," which, unlike the
ridiculous prediction of "inefficient over reporting," actually may have
occurred since fraudulent under reporting under TSCA did in fact create
"serious internal difficulties for the chemical industry..." which, at least in
the vinyl, was resolved "internally" through knowing violation of TSCA ad 8
(e) provisions as only a small part of its "internal difficulties" in complying
with the law or any requirement that it reported significant or true
information with regard to toxicity to anyone. (CMA 37382).
1/10/78 (CMA 12603-12604 and 37385-37404) - MCA Board of Directors
Meeting Minutes.
CMA concealed its introduction of Mr. Frost "who joined the
association's staff as General Council on January 9, 1978." Other
information indicates he was or became a vice-president as well. The
activities of Mr. Frost were relevant to this litigation and CMA knew it long
before it started producing documents.
CMA concealed the board of directors consideration of "public attitude
toward the chemical industry" in which a consultant discussed "findings of a
deteriorated public attitude toward chemicals and chemical manufacturers
which he related principally to concerns about health." (CMA 37386). CMA
concealed both the existence and the activities of its special committee on
product liability and continues to remain in contempt the court's order that it
produce unredacted copies of these documents. The same survey of MCA
members, which showed product liability was not a problem for the chemical
industry, was also concealed in previous documents (e.g., board minutes
11/21/77 at CMA 37362). Here, CMA continues to conceal information in
these minutes which they stipulated were not confidential years ago,
redacting (even in its most recent production) information on the grounds
that portions of the information in these admittedly non-confidential
documents are somehow "privileged"; which, by the way, inconsistent with
every previous ruling of the court addressing minutes. Not one privilege
claim with regard to meeting minutes has been upheld and CMA's continued
"redacted" of these documents can only be considered in direct contempt of
the court's prior orders. (CMA 37387).
Consistent with its prior pattern, CMA concealed that it, using
"commitments from 63 companies" was bankrolling the AIHC to the tune
$1,081,000 just leading up to the "OSHA proposal for generic regulation of
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
carcinogens" (CMA 37388). Mr. Berker "urged all testimony of the hearings
in the belief that it will add significally to the impact of written statements."
CMA has still not produced relevant reports from its Technical and
Functional Committees (CMA 37388-389) which "were distributed in
advance with the tentative agenda" which, unlike, many others of the most
recent versions of the minutes (September, 1996) is not preceded by a copy
of the agenda (see, for example, the agenda for the previous board meeting
for 11/21/77.) (CMA 37356). Whereas much relevant information has been
found in the reports of the Technical and Functional Committees, including
some of these, such as Government Relations Committee, Industrial
Relations Advisory Committee, Legal Advisory Committee, and even the
Occupational Health Committee. The absence of these reports corresponds
with their distribution along with the agenda. There is no reason that they
shouldn't have been produced here as well just because they were sent in
advance of the meeting instead of distributed at the meeting. In fact, they
are incorporated into the minutes in the exactly the same way they are when
the reports are attached to the minutes. CMA has used the fact that
"summaries of recent meetings of the following committees were distributed
in advance with the tentative agenda" to conceal them, which they
apparently have given up doing to some extent when the documents were
actually "attached" to the minutes, instead being distributed in advance of
them. (CMA 37388. Also see evidence of similar concealment within
11/21/77 board meeting minutes at CMA 37360, etc.)
CMA concealed the board's approval of "continuation of a multicomponent study of vinyl chloride at the University of Louisville." (CMA
37404)
"Other likely reform items would permit deduction of only 50% of cost
of business-related meals and eliminate deductibility country club dues paid
2/14/78 (CMA 12605-12606 and 37406-37443) - MCA Board of Directors
Meeting Minutes.
MCA concealed the appointment of E. B. Frost as an MCA Vice
President: "Mr. Driver's appointment of Mr. Frost (General Council) as a Vice
President of the association was approved." (CMA 37407). CMA concealed
the Special Review Committee report and all references to the report (CMA
37407-408 and Exhibit B: CMA 37415-37439) "on three prior occasions1957, 1962, and 1968, Board level examinations of the objectives,
structure, and program of the Association have been conducted by formal
study to assist MCA's fitness and performance with respect to services and
effective action on industries behalf..." (CMA 37415).
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
Observations included that "because overwhelming legislative,
regulatory, and society pressures, MCA staff backup, particularly for the
Technical and Functional Committee work, is often hampered by lack of
decisive responsiveness and timely support." (CMA 37415).
"Although in some instances there is a specific need [emphasis
applied] for review by council, there is a tendency to request council to
review and make recommendations rather than first develop technical
information [emphasis applied] and recommend positions for presentation to
an agency or legislative body, resulting in delay of needed evaluation." (CMA
37416).
There is reference to the strong feelings "some members of the MCA"
have about "a more aggressive advocacy role" for this CMA "especially
regarding regulation and questions." (CMA 37416).
CMA concealed the changes in its committee structure effective
6/1/78, which, if accomplished, consolidated the previous Air Quality, Solid
Waste Management, and Water Resources Committees into a new
"Environmental Management Committee; Labels and Precautionary
Information, Occupational Health, Safety and Fire Protection Committees
consolidated into a single Occupational and Health Committee; and Chemical
Packaging, Transportation and Distribution, Transportation Equipment
Committees, consolidated into a single "Distribution" committee. The
dissolution of the "Public Relations" and "Education Activities" committees,
with their previous functions to be conducted " within staff on a
maintenance basis and with Executive Committee for special PR projects..."
as well as the dissolution of the "Legal Advisory" Committee which,
similarly, would "continue through MCA in House General Council and
designated Executive Committee Member's corporate staffs. The Industrial
Relations Advisory Committee was discontinued and the Plastics Committee
was finally discontinued. (CMA 37418). Especially, considering the courts
long-expressed desire that CMA, and other defendants, provide their
information, primarily, of production of documents, CMA has consistently
concealed this sort of relevant, almost essential information relating to its
CMA committee structure and operation. (CMA 37417-418).
All Technical and Functional Committees appointments, including the
chairman, go through the Executive Committee, on the recommendation of
the president. From the Executive Committee, each Technical and Functional
Committee appointment goes to the Board for ratification. (CMA 37418).
CMA concealed that the CMA vinyl panels membership which often
exceeded "fifteen in number" was against the general rule and must have
Q:\wp51\Mollie\37096-37464
been determined by the Executive Committee to be an advisable exception.
"This says that the term of individual committee members was to be
limited to three years! (CMA 37419). With one-third of the membership
rotated annually." (CMA 37419).
Despite the clarity of plaintiffs allegations and the clear relevance of
MCA modification of its "advocacy role" as a result of board action to allow
increased adequacy on TSCA, (CMA 37420 and 37422), these documents
clearly show CMA's intention to step up its advocacy efforts. "MCA should
take an active role in implantation process of TSCA which EPA was to
shortly undertake. CMA concealed CRAC was, which monitored CMA's
Technical Committees, was created "in furtherance of this [advocacy] role."
("Furtherance of this role, a newly constituted Chemical Regulations Advisory
Committee [CRAC]), is to be primarily concerned with the development of
regulations implanting TSCA" and to "assist" EPA in its implementation of
TSCA.
Although MCA claims to stand by its previous "policy" (followed only
when it suited them) to avoid "questions involving a particular... chemical
substance," things have changed now and: "Nevertheless, should a
proposed regulation involve a precedent-setting or first-impression principle,
or for other special reasons, may be important for MCA to take a position."
MCA concealed its official position that "MCA advocacy does not
restrict the independence of MCA member companies," which is relevant
because it is a lie. MCA advocacy does, in fact, restrict the independence
of MCA member companies and documents produced in this case prove it.
The CMA concealed its reference to the "sharp rebuke" which the
house "handed the administration, Ralph Nader, and Congressional
leadership" by voting down the proposed Consumer Protection Agencies Bill
which would create a separate department of consumer advocacy in
proceedings before other agencies, and empowered to appeal agency
regulatory decisions. (CMA 37426). This bill had been before Congress in
one form or another for eight years. A similar bill passed the House during
the Ford administration by 344 to 44. The reason for this "turnaround" is
stated to have been " the massive lobbying effort in opposition which was
mounted by the business community" as well as "evidence of a back-lash
resentment against Ralph Nader and his tactics, wherein he was sharply
critical of Congressmen who are undecided, and especially so when they
happened to be former allies." (CMA 37426).
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
CMA concealed the relevant activities of the end of the existence of
its "Legislative Communication Programs," including the reference to the
survey of 107 responding companies showing 2,381,079 employees,
4,598,338 stock holders, 391,013 retirees, etc., (CMA 37431) and
discusses "specific efforts" to various employers were made or weren't
making "to inform employees, stockholders, and retirees about pending
legislative issues and the potential impact on the company." (CMA 37432).
Lobbying activities are described in great detail (CMA 37429-439), including
references to company organization of PAC's, "computer data banks or other
retrieval systems which might be useful tools in grass root communication
programs...," etc. (CMA 37438). CMA concealed its staff report (CMA
37440-443), including the president's having written OSHA that the
"proposed OSHA standard on the identification of chemical substances
would place this incredible burden on all U.S. industry and the U.S. public."
CMA gave EPA preliminary information from Foster D. Snell, the study
of the emissions from facilities producing or using benzene, which is reported
to have been "approximately one-half of those reported to the Advisory
Committee in the Stanford Research Institute study." (CMA 37441).
"The Guide for the Preparation of Safety Data Sheets is now available
in a new edition, its sixth revision," despite the relevance of SD-56 to
plaintiffs allegations and discovery, subpoenas, etc. All copies of this Guide
and all references to it were concealed by CMA. (CMA 37442).
Consistent with prior practice, CMA concealed information showing
that the AIHC was the child of industry and that its "proposed 'alternatives'
concerning regulation of carcinogens appear to be receiving serious
consideration..." by OSHA and labor. (CMA 37409).
CMA has again concealed the reports of the Technical and Functional
Committees which "were distributed in advance of the tentative agenda..."
3/16/78 - (CMA 12607-12608 and 37445-37464) - MCA Board
Meeting Minutes.
Consistent with its prior practices, CMA concealed its discussion of
the AIHC and its large budget: "Originally AlHC's purposed solely to the
OSHA proposal for generic regulations carcinogen. A poll of its supporting
companies has approved broading the scope to apply to carcinogens in the
work place which regulatory body is involved." (Amended 4/11/78 replacing
the phrase "carcinogen in the work place" with "generic cancer policies.")
Q:\wp51 \Mollie\37096-37464
CMA concealed the report of its Government Relations Committee
(CMA 37447 and 37454-460), including discussion of the "Chemical Injury
Indemnity Program" discussed at the TSCA hearings and MCA appearances
on panels, etc.
CMA concealed its staff report (CMA 37461-464) discussing MCA's
appearance at hearings on the proposed generic carcinogen regulations,
CMA concealed references to CRAC's having developed TSCA
workshops (CMA 37463), CMA's intervention in the API's appeal of the
OSHA benzene standard (CMA 37462).
CMA concealed its reference to its submission of "a final report of an
epidemiological study of the mortality of workers and workers employed in
the production of vinyl chloride and its polymers. The report covers the
investigations from June 15, 1973 through December, 1977. The research
covers 10,173 workers from 37 plants and the contractor indicated that
CMA concealed its support of a "tax-exempt organization" called the
American Council on Science and Health founded by Dr. Elizabeth M.
Wheelan, "author of 'Panic in the Pantry' and other books which take a
reasoned approach to chemicals and to be risk/benefit concept..." The
scientists at ACSH "fifteen at present, are deeply concerned that emotion is
replacing science in governmental and public decisions and are pledged to
speak out when fallacy or emotion replaces fact in their specialties. ACSH is
being pinched for funds, but in the interest of independence and credibility
will not accept support from any chemical company or any company in
which could even remotely be concerned with the aims of the council."
However, CMA concealed that Dr. Wheelan "would be happy to hear from
you" if "you are [a member of the board of directors of the Chemical
Manufacturers Association] interested in the work of the council and know of
possible sources of funds, such as foundations..." (CMA 37464).

Exhibit B
Report of the Pension Committee
to the
Board of Directors
November 22, 1976
Pursuant to its responsibility concerning non*salary benefits for
the Association's staff, the Pension Committee recommends approval of
the following:
(1) Adjuatmeht of Pension Payments to Retirees
Two years
ago, when the Pension Plan was revised, the principle of periodic adjust­
ment of pension payments to past retirees in recognition of increased
cost of living was accepted.
Since then, pension payments to former Federal employees
have increased by nearly 18%, of which 15% was occasioned by rise in the
Consumer Price Index.
It is proposed to increase pension payments by 4% per year
in retirement since 12/1/74, the date of the only prior adjustment. This
would amount to 8% for the five retirees and one surviving spouse who
were then receiving benefits, and lesser percentages for the five employees
who retired between 4/1/75 and 10/1/76.
The amortized annual cost of the proposed adjustment approxi­
(2) Term Life Insurance Coverage for Future Retirees
For
employees, MCA now provides term life insurance coverage of two times
annual salary, but no continuation in retirement. The option to convert
at personal expense is unattractive because of the high cost of attained-age
premium. Continuation is not uncommon, however, but usually on a re­
duced and declining scale.
It is proposed to provide term life insurance for members of
the staff retiring from MCA on or after December 1, 1976 as follows,
designed for family protection rather than as an estate factor:
For any MCA retiree who completed seven years
of service, of which at least five during the tenye^r period immediately preceding retirement
were continuous, and who’has legal dependents
at death:
Amount equal to final annual salary, subject
to a minimum of $10, 000 and a maximum of
$25, 000 for the first two years in retirement;
CMA 037106
f
2
Amount equal to 50% of final salary, subject
to a minimum of $5, 000 and a maximum of
$12,500, for the third, fourth, and fifth years
in retirement; and
$2, 000 after the fifth year in retirement.
For any other MCA retiree who completed three years
of service and who has legal dependents at death:
Amount equal to 50% of final salary subject to
for the first five years in retirement; and
$2, 000 after the fifth year in retirement.
For any other MCA retiree:
At the maximum benefit level ($25, 000 first two years) and at
current rate quotations, the peak cost of about $1,235 per individual would
occur in the second year of retirement (age 66). Overall cost from age 65
through age 79 would total about $6, 600.
MCA has five employees whose normal retirement dates occur
between April 1977 and November 1981. Assuming all at the maximum
benefit level, annual cost would begin at about $1,150 in the current year
' and build to about $4, 000 in fiscal year 1981-82.
(3) Partial Substitution of Ordinary Life for Term Life Insurance
The cost of life insurance provided to an employee in excess of $50, 000
coverage is supplemental income taxable to the employee. At higher salary
levels, the two-times-salary term life insurance benefit provided by MCA
imposes a considerable tax outlay.
IKS allows for a combination of term and ordinary life insurance
under which the insurance company allocates the premium between the two.
The imputed cost of any excess above $50, 000 term plus the cost of the
ordinary life is taxable income to the individual. Advantage lies in a level
premium for the ordinary life portion at the starting age. making it more
attractive for personal continuation on retirement, plus the accumulation
of cash value.
It is proposed to divide the coverage equally between ordinary
life and term for employees at or above the $35, 000 salary level, namely,
continue with one times salary of term and substitute the second one tim s
CMA 037107
salary with ordinary life. The estimated aggregate of increased cost to
the several employees that would qualify --at their current salary levels -is about $9,800 to the time of retirement, whereas the aggregate cash value
of their policies at retirement would be about $51,500, contrasting with no
value at all from term insurance at whatever level.
The added cost to MCA in the current year would approach
$6, 000. dropping to less than $4. 000 after retirement of the first employee
who would qualify.
(4) Reduction of Qualifications for Term Life Insurance Coverage
Formerly, there was a linkage in the funding of the pension plan and group
term life insurance, thus making it logical to set the same age and service
qualifications for enrollment. Concurrent with the revision of the pension
plan two years ago, however, the funding arrangements of the two were
separated and became independent of one another.
While it is legal for an age requirement to be stipulated as being
the same as for pension coverage, as MCA now does, it has been learned it
would be illegal to specify an age limitation as such. It is proposed to
eliminate the age requirement (now 25 years) rather than retain it on a
technicality.
Also, the present requirement of one year of service is an un­
usually long qualification period, one to three months being more common.
It is proposed to lower the requirement to three months, this being the
-period now in effect to qualify for MCA's medical benefits.
The cost of these changes would be minimal. There are relative­
ly few below age 25 on the staff, premium rates for the young are low, and
their inclusion has an offsetting effect of lowering the average age of the
covered group. The cost of the reduced service requirement would be
modest, also, considering the low turnover rate among high-salaried em­
ployees.

- Antitrust Enforcement (pl 94-435), survived two Senate fili­
busters and last-ditch House opposition; authorizes states
attorneys general to bring class action type suits on behalf
of citizens; requires large companies to notify government
of planned mergers; strengthens Federal antitrust investigatory
powers.

- Tax Revision (PL 94-455), was the product of three years work
but fell far short of reforms promised by Democratic congressional leaders; plans for major overhaul of taxation of U.S.
multinational corporations were dropped from the bill, which
in final form extended the investment tax credit for another
four years, increased the minimum tax for business and altered
somewhat the rules for corporate foreign tax credits.

expands Federal and state programs
with new authorizations and powers for EPA, a Federal regulatory
program for hazardous wastes, a ban on open dumping within five
years, and authorizations for state and local solid waste
management and research programs.
However, election-year jitters, veto threats, internal squabbles
and the pressure of an abbreviated Congressional session combined to
forestall enactment of a number of other proposals — virtually all
of which are likely to surface again.
These include:
- A bill to provide stricter regulation of lobbying, which died
amid last minute parliamentary manuevering as Congress ad­
journed; Common Cause is a strong advocate, while Nader groups
and the AFL-CIO supported only the House version; business
is apprehensive over the prospect of heavier record-keeping
and reporting requirements; dues paid to trade associations by
corporate members could be subject to public disclosure under
some concepts.
c
- Clean Air Amendments fell victim to a Senate filibuster as the
Session ended; Senator Muskie has blamed the auto industry for
killing the measure and may resist efforts for quick action on
a stretch-out or relaxation of strict mobile emission standards
set to take effect in 1978; the so-called non-attainment and
non-degredation issues were also highly controversial and sure
to be hotly debated in the next Congress.
- Water Pollution legislation died in conference; chief issues
were degree of control over the nation's wetlands, expanded
state authority in developing wastewater treatment facilities
and delay of mid-1977 water quality deadlines for municipalities.
The 95th Congress is expected to take a thorough look at the
entire Federal Water Pollution Control Act, using as a starting
point the report of the President's Commission on Water Quality.
- Natural Gas Deregulation legislation defied attempts to find a
viable compromise although both the House and Senate passed
versions of the bill; no conference was held and the bills
died, thereby continuing the current artificially low regulated
prices, and thus discouraging new exploration and production.
- industrial Reorganization, the so-called Hart bill, never got
beyond the early hearing stages; its chief sponsor, Michigan
Senator Philip A. Hart, is retiring; the measure singles out
chemicals manufacturing and other industries for possible break­
up, creates a special commission to make divestiture investi­
gations and a special court to compel dismantling.

_ petroleum Divestiture legislation would have required major
oil companies to separate into single operations for production, refining-marketing, and transportation; another bill
would have forced "horizontal" divestiture, thus keeping oil
companies out of other energy source interests (m though the
"vertical" bill cleared a Senate committee it was never taken
up on the floor.
- corporate Chartering legislation failed to make much headway,
but could arise again; oversight hearings were held in the
Senate Commerce Committee; one concept would require a Federal
charter of corporations, with annual reporting on the makeup
of the board of directors, product line sales and voting stock
ownership.
Among the numerous other bills which failed to achieve Congressional
0r presidential approval were these:
strict controls over strip-mining;
land use controls;
the outlawing of corporate bribes to foreign officials;
common situs picketing in the construction industry;
proposals to create a consumer protection agency;
expanded powers and investigative authority for the Federal
Trade Commission.
CARTER ADMINISTRATION PREPARING TO TAKE OFFICE
Using what pollster Lou Harris called "the old Roosevelt coalition"
as the backbone of his campaign. Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia
has become president-elect, and is now hard at work on the massive task
of organizing his Administration.
Recent days have seen Mr. Carter
closeted with such Ford Administration notables as George Bush (for
a security briefing) and Henry Kissinger (to talk foreign affairs),
and at 3:30 this afternoon he is in personal conference with President
Ford to discuss the transition of the Government.
Washington bureaucrats, politicians and diplomats are giving
Mr. carter close scrutiny, perhaps motivated by uneasiness and
uncertainty as much as by mere curiosity. After all, Jimmy Carter has
run as an anti-establishment candidate for nearly two years.
He has
criticized both the form and substance of government in Washington,
|s vowed sweeping reforms and new programs, has fought bitter campaign
™&tles with recognized leaders of his own party. ' However, on election
":9ht he made a quick transition from critic on the outside to manager
n the inside.
Jimmy Carter now IS the establishment.
fe
CMA 037114
And therefore he is now confronted with a dilemma of some delicacy,
how to begin to direct and to motivate the people and the mechanisms
he has so recently and soundly castigated.
He must find and appoint
cabinet heads and officeholders with the capacity to make the machinery
of government work, and this would seem to indicate a need for experi­
enced personnel; but at the same time he must avoid the appearance
of making his appointments from the lists of known political figures
and party professionals. He needs new faces, but he also needs the
reliability and depth of background that only experience can provide.
There are signs that a number of Carter appointments may be
revealed relatively soon, so that incoming officials will have maximum
time for planning and coordination with departing officials of the
Ford Administration.
Observers around the world will be carefully
watching these appointments for clues to the attitudes of the Carter
Administration, the influence being wielded by various interest groups
and power-brokers, and for indications as to the political wisdom of
the President-elect himself.
Among the most delicate tasks confronting Mr. Carter, and one he
appears to recognize clearly as such, is the establishing of communica­
tions links with — and hopefully some measure of control over — the
Congress.
His recent meeting with 16 Democratic Congressional leaders
last week at the farm-estate of Georgia Senator Herman Talmadge was
surely an effort to hold out the olive branch and to begin to build
support for key programs.
The discussions were reportedly broad in
nature, touching on matters relating to the strength of the economy
and'reorganization of Government.
Some observers believe, however, that the new President may
encounter considerable difficulty with the Congress, despite the
fact that both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue are now firmly in
Democratic hands. They reason it this way: Congressional leaders
and Committee chairmen, while criticizing the "stalemate government"
of Presidents Nixon and Ford, have obviously enjoyed the indepen­
dence and status which the years of confrontation have produced.
They
have had an important role in punishing one President and in making
his successor appear ineffectual, and are therefore likely to covet
their independence of action.
Moreover, bills and programs delayed
by attention to Watergate or stalled by Ford vetoes are already in
fairly polished form, and are not likely to be dropped readily by
their sponsors in favor of Carter alternatives.
Yet another factor
will be the attitude of the White House itself, and long-time Carter
watchers point out that he adopted a tough, no compromise attitude
toward the Georgia legislature during his term as Governor.
CMA037115
5
MEW PRESIDENT AND HIS VIEWS
Much of official Washington is now speculating on the future
sections of policy and programs in the Carter Administration.
HoWever, from speeches and statements by the President-elect, and
from the Democratic Party Platform itself it is possible to reach
some preliminary judgments.
With respect to the economy. Governor Carter appears firmly in
favor of creating more jobs and providing stimulus to the national
economy. The prospect of a one-shot tax cut is being seriously
discussed. The formation of a national youth corp to hire and train
young people from urban areas is another Carter aim, and is consistent
with bis support for direct job creation with emphasis on public
service employment. He also favors moderate interest rates, continued
support of investment credits, strong anti-trust enforcement and a
strengthening of the Council on Wage and price Stability.
Tax reform,
though a popular topic at the campaign podium, will take considerably
longer to accomplish.
The environment will receive high priority in the Carter Adminisation. The incoming president has opposed extending the compliance
feadlines for automobile exhaust emissions and would apparently retain
the present non-degredation concepts of the Clean Air Act.
He has
called, for strict enforcement of water pollution control laws and
evidently will oppose efforts to weaken the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act.
He supports strict controls over strip mining.
m
National energy policies may undergo some changes under President
Carter with greater emphasis on energy conservation, and a strengthening
of environmental controls over energy production. He plans to deemphasize nuclear development and to require stricter regulation in
construction of new nuclear power plants.
He evidently will push for
increased reliance on domestic coal from the deep mines of Appalachia
and would oppose heavy development of strip-mined coal resources in
the Western United States. He opposes further expansion of Western
coal-leasing and supports strong state participation in offshore oil
lease decisions.
He would favor mandatory mileage standards for
automobiles with economic penalties on those with less fuel efficiency.
He opposes Federal subsidies for synthetic fuel production.
ME 95TH CONGRESS;
NEW FACES. NEW LEADERS. SAME VOTE RATIOS
When the smoke of election day had cleared, the new Congress
koked almost exactly like the old one — th Senate will again be
imposed of 62 Democrats and 38 Republicans, and the House shows a
shift to the Democrats of only two seats, the new ratio being 292-143
in their favor.
CMA 037116
6
On closer inspection, however, the changes will be both numerous
and significant: virtually the entire leadership with change in both
Houses and in both parties; there is a substantial crop of "freshmen",
especially in the Senate; there will be many shifts in key committee
responsibilities; there is talk of major committee realignment in the
Senate.
The House will organize itself in early December, in that Members
will be named to committees, new chairmen will be elected and changes
in House rules and committee jurisdictions will be considered. Not
until the 95th Congress convenes in January, however, will subcommittee
assignments be made, committee rules considered or leadership positions
voted on.
There are 67 new House Members, 47 Democrats and 20 Republicans.
Overall, the election produced overwhelming success for incumbents
with 95 percent of those running being returned to office.
The
strong re-election rate held true for the 79 so-called "Watergate
freshmen", those Democratic Congressmen first elected in the offyear
el ction of 1974. Despite high Republican hopes against that group,
78 ran for re-election and 76 won.
There will be a number of important changes in the chairmanships
of House committees and subcommittees, 28 in all, including new
chairmen for the following:
- Budget Committee (committee 2-year rotation rule)
- The Interior Committee (jurisdiction includes energy matters,
mining)
- International Relations Committee (foreign affairs)
- Merchant Marine and Fisheries (merchant marine matters,
oceanography, coastal zone management)
- Post Office Committee (the postal system)
- Public works and Transportation Committee (water pollution
control, most transportation matters)
- Rules Committee (clearance of legislation for House floor
debate)
Another development worthy of mention is the fact that there are
seven vacancies to be filled on the House Ways and Means Committee
wherein taxation and trade legislation are written.
CMA 037117
I
7
The Senate will also undergo some interesting changes.
Incumbents
didn't fare as well as their House colleagues with only 16 of the 25
Senators running being returned.
The 64 percent re-election rate for
incumbents was the lowest in the history of direct Senate elections.
There will be 18 freshman Senators, counting Governor Wendell Anderson,
who will replace Vice President-elect Mondale.
Ten are Democrats and
eight Republicans.
Three committee chairmen were defeated: Hartke (Veterans Affairs),
Moss (Aeronautics and Space), and McGee (Post Office and Civil Service).
There will be considerable change in the memberships of several
Senate Committees, including Commerce, where there are 7 vacancies
to be filled. Finance (4 vacancies) and Judiciary (5 vacancies).
A further unknown in the Senate is whether or not reorganization
will bring a significant shift in committee jurisdictions and respon­
sibilities. A reorganization proposal in the form of a Senate
Resolution has been drafted by the Committee on Committees headed by
Senator Adlai E. Stevenson, Jr. (D-lll.), and could be taken up early
in 1977. The resolution presents a number of alternatives for
consideration and could eventually lead to elimination of some
committees, and the shifting of important environmental and energy
responsibilities.

Exhibit G
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
JOSEPH SANDFORD, JR., CHAIRMAN
CHEMICAL PACKAGING COMMITTEE
NOVEMBER 22,
1976
The activities of the Chemical Packaging Committee
emphasize two major areas - regulations and legislation.
Our
objective today is to provide background on our Committee oper­
ations and how we are assisting each of our companies to achieve
both safety in packaging and regulatory compliance.
Times have changed!
Just a few years ago, a chemical
packaging engineer might be concentrating on the steel thickness
of a drum for solvents, the moisture barrier in a bag for plastic
resins, or a fungicide box closure.
Today, he must also know
about the Transportation Safety Act of 1974, the consolidation
of DOT regulations, the .Metric Conversion Act of 1975, inter­
national shipping regulations, and, looking to the future, reg­
ulations on solid waste disposal and carcinogens.
What has caused this change in our Committee's activ­
ities? We believe the most important factor is the concern on
the part of both the private and public sectors for greater
safety in the packaging, transportation and distribution of haz­
ardous materials.
The Department of Transportation's past two
annual reports on hazardous materials control are more specific
about this concern over safety.
In these two years, 59 fatalities
and over 1,500 injuries occurred in all hazardous materials
incidents of which over 50% involved chemical products.
The De­
partment of Transportation, or as we usually say "DOT", also
lists the ten worst accidents for each year? 70% of these in­
volved chemical industry products with a total of nine fatalities
and 340 people injured.
It is for reasons like this that the
Committee's activities emphasize regulations and legislation.
The major legislative act affecting our activities
is the Transportation Safety Act of 1974, passed by Congress
in early 1975.
Key points include:
The D partment of Transportation's authority is
extended to regulate package unloading, certain
types of storage and shipment routing.
CMA 037119
Procedures for obtaining package exemptions are
made much more complex.
DOT authority is extended to container manufacturers
and even to commodities not presently defined as
hazardous.
Criminal as well as civil penalties can be imposed
for violations with imprisonment for up to five
years now included.
In the regulatory field, DOT has just issued its
complete consolidation of Title 49 of the Code of Federal
Regulations which contains the regulations governing the trans­
portation and packaging of hazardous materials.
This document
has been over four years in preparation and incorporates many
regulatory changes affecting the use, labeling, marking and
shipment of chemical packages.
The Metric Conversion Act has been enacted into law;
it creates a metric board to oversee voluntary conversion in the
United States.
We believe metrication will initially affect our
export packaging with domestic packages going metric over the
next ten years.
Our liaison with Canadian MCA member companies
- is providing valuable input based on their experience in metric
conversion.
Export shipments require industry packaging personnel
to be aware of United Nations and XMCO regulations and appropriate
rail and truck regulations in the various countries to which we
ship.
The regulations of IMCO, or more properly the Intergovern­
mental Maritime Consultative Organization, are contained in an
eight-volume set covering water movement of hazardous materials.
Solid waste disposal legislation recently enacted
has not affected packaging.
However, legislation proposed but
not passed, would have imposed a fee on packaging materials
that are not reusable or recyclable.
Regulations and legislation while deeply involved with
safety also have an economic effect on packaging.
DOT recognizes
this to a degree and has introduced the term "cost/benefit" to be
considered in any reviews of package regulation changes.
Packaging
is a significant cost item in our industry.
The chemical industry
uses over 50 million new and reconditioned steel and fibre drums
annually at a cost of about $500 million.
The industry uses
about seven billion square feet of corrugated fibreboard in boxes
to hold our plastics, agricultural chemicals and acids at an
CMA037120
annual cost of $300 million.
We use some 600 million bags and
15 million pallets a year.
The total annual cost of packaging
materials in our industry approaches $1.5 billion or about 2%
of sales.
Perhaps of equal importance from a solid waste disposal
standpoint, this represents in the range of one billion pounds
of steel, one and a half billion pounds of paperboard and 750
million pounds of wood.
The agendas and organization of the Committee's task
groups and subcommittees reflect our concern over regulations
and legislation.
A few examples illustrate the positive action
we are taking to assist our industry.
First, we recently formed a new regulations and legis­
lation subcommittee to control all of our activities in this
area such as metrication, definitions of hazardous materials,
liaison with DOT and our activities on the intercommittee group
on international regulations.
Our Metrication Task Group coordinates Committee
activity with initial efforts emphasizing proper inclusion of
m trication in DOT regulations, and coordination of differences
in export and domestic regulations.
The Small Packages Subcommittee is developing a tech­
nical bulletin on proper packaging and transportation of samples
and small quantities.
A task group has developed technical bulletins on
proper techniques for loading, bracing and blocking in truck,
rail car and piggyback shipments.
DOT regulations require
safe loading but don't really specify effective techniques.
A newly proposed hazardous materials regulation spec­
ified testing requirements that current acid carboys would not
pass.
A task group worked closely with suppliers to develop a
new carboy design that met all requirements.
A recent change in the definition and test for corrosive
materials meant that drums currently used for products such as
dyes, cleaning compounds or mining reagents were no longer legal.
The Drum Subcommittee coordinated industry input and succeeded
in having a new section added in Title 49 to cover these lower
hazard products and allow continued use of present packages.
CMA 037121
The increasing complexity and many changes in the
regulations created a need for greater awareness on the part of
our employees as well as those in our carrier and distributor
organizations.
The Committee, together with the Transportation
Equipment and Transportation and Distribution Committees, spon­
sored a symposium on hazardous materials regulations with over
1,100 attendees from all concerned shipper and carrier groups.
As to the future, each subcommittee has an active task
group reviewing waste disposal effects on our packages, including
possible reuse and recycle.
The Plastic Drum Task Group recently
sponsored a workshop on plastic drum development with DOT, the
National Bureau of Standards, which is DOT'S contracting agency
on plastic drum developments, and representatives from the Plastic
Drum Institute, the producers' association.
Hopefully, this
joint approach, which we consider to be a significant breakthrough,
will provide the forum for full participation by all groups in
regulations development and application.
In the future, we may
have an entirely new class of hazardous materials to package since
DOT has already indicated they have under development regulations
applying to the proper packaging and transportation of health
products such as carcinogens, mutagens and teratogens.
The Chemical Packaging Committee activities far exceed
- earlier efforts in the design and development of drums, bags or
boxes to safely carry our products.
We must consider the product
itself and any potential health hazard; the package and packaging
' operation to insure we meet DOT regulations; the transportation
and distribution requirements such as proper loading, bracing
and blocking; customers must be able to safely use our packages,
and looking to the future, we must be able to return them or
provide safe reuse or disposal to prevent solid waste problems.
In summary, we believe our responsibility is to assist
the chemical industry to meet all legal requirements while main­
taining a low-risk position in transportation with proper cost/
benefit considerations.
And we intend to make known the position
of our industry on legislative and regulatory matters.
We have emphasized today the effect of regulations
and legislation on packaging.
Actually, the areas covered
affect the entire field of transportation and distribution in
the chemical industry.
Most member companies have active pro­
grams relating to hazardous materials.
Du Pont calls its
CMA 037122
program the "RHYTHM" program, an acronym for Remember How You
Treat Hazardous Materials.
Xn closing, I will show a short film
that was developed to summarize this program.
Although it
emphasizes only one company's efforts, we believe it helps
illustrate the continued need for MCA commitment and involvement
in transportation, distribution and packaging activities.

Exhibit H
REPORT TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
James E. McKee Jr., Chairman
Public Relations Committee
November 22, 1976
Th hazards of holding the same office for two years are obvious.
My position today is not unlike that of a re-elected politician.
It's important to assess what was said to this audience last year!
In 1975, the Public Relations Committee report covered two main
points for future action:
1. That we would focus more sharply on major opportunities as well
as the larger problems of the chemical industry, and
2. That we would establish closer relationships with other functional
areas of MCA so a more meaningful contribution to the industry's
total communications could be made.
These things have been done.
The assaults on the chemical industry by media and government in
the past 12 months have made it imperative.
In addition, the
opportunity to participate in Dr. Heckert's Special Committee on
Toxic Substances Legislation demonstrated what can be accomplished
through interaction of functions when proper leadership is provided.
'Spurred by today's public demands and the proof that joint committee
action can get things done, the Public Relations Committee stepped
tip its practice of meeting with the leadership of certain other
functional committees, particularly Government Relations, Technical
and Legal Advisory.
This was started about 18 months ago to gain a better perspective
of MCA's needs. What we have found is that we can work together
-- that we can have a common purpose and pursuit. We have agreed
upon issues that should be the greatest concern of the association.
These are human health and the environment, and increasing govern­
ment constraints which erode industry's management of its resources.
Cooperation to date has prompted us to adopt a plan for Industry
spokesmanship, encompassing an even larger number of functional
committees.
The plan was proposed by a former chairman of our committee, Ned
Brandt of Dow, and adopted at our September meeting. Most of the
committees we have approached have already responded favorably.
These committees are Air Quality, Water Resources, Solid Waste,
Occupational Health, Government Relations, Legal Advisory and
Chemical Regulations Advisory.
CMA 037124
The plan calls for establishing a task force with representatives
of those committees and the public relations committee to stimulate
spokesmanship on the public issues.
Each committee will be asked to provide basic facts and a statement
representing MCA’s position on their function as related to govern­
ment, health and environment. The Air Quality Committee, for
example, will provide facts on what the chemical industry has done
about air pollution, and provide the industry position on current
legislative and regulatory matters.
Members of the task force would serve as coordinators of the project
recruit the best possible spokesmen from MCA's membership and arrange
platforms in leading cities where maximum exposure to our point of, 6
view can be gained. We have in mind prestigious platforms like the
Economic Club of Detroit, with accompanying appearances on local
radio and TV plus newspaper interviews.
The task force would be responsible for placing industry material
in the hands of selected spokesmen, coordinating appearances on a
geographic basis and making sure that the load was properly spread
among the member companies.
Each speaker would develop his topic in his own way, weaving in
the MCA-developed material at will.
The type of spokesmen we have in mind are you gentlemen, the
directors of MCA, supported by other chief executive officers not
present today.
The plan has both short- and long-range advantages: The short range
is obvious -- to gain some badly needed statements of the chemical
industry point of view in various media. The longer range advantage
will be gained as we build up this corps of spokesmen. MCA has a
constant need for industry experts who can provide statements and
make appearances on relatively short notice.
News media, as you know, will use responses to issues and handle
"the other side's" position when the story is breaking.
There is
no public relations benefit in a tardy response.
It's either
ignored or becomes a liability as its availability provides the
media opportunity to retell the whole sordid story.
We hope to get this plan underway in early 1977.
It goes without saying that all on-going PR programs are being
directed toward the same issues to which the spokesmanship plan
will be addressed.
CMA 037125
I
ChemEcology will expand further its coverage of member company
success stories in the areas of environment and toxic substances.
Participation next April in the American Women in Radio and
Television spokesmanship program for lay audiences will stress
positive contributions by the chemical industry with emphasis on
health and environmental protection.
MCA News will continue to report on industry and company programs
in these key public issues so that good ideas can be shared across
the membership.
We are considering an idea proposed by our member from American
Cyanamid, Joe Calitri, whereby awards could be given to member
company plants which have achieved goals in energy conservation.
This program, of course, could demonstrate MCA's dedication to
energy conservation and show that even without a national energy
policy -- the industry is dedicated to conservation.
We will also continue our three-times-a-year Chemical Issues &
Commentary -- the survey of member companies to identify emerging
issues. This practice goes back to 1973, when we began polling
people participating in MCA activities in six companies and the
professional staff of MCA. That panel has now grown to 19
companies and MCA with over 400 respondents. And it's the study
upon which we base our forward planning we share with you today.
Gentlemen, it's well known that the 95th Congress will inherit
roost of this year's environmental and energy issues. Water and
air pollution legislation will doubtless take over the spotlight
recently occupied by toxic substances.
Chemicals in food and
food packaging will join other lurking problems like pesticides
to keep all of us busy. We must be prepared to answer our critics,
to itemize consequences of tradeoffs and to accentuate the positive
side of the chemical industry.

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OF
THE MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
BY
MATTHEW P. LANDERS
NOVEMBER 22, 1976
I appreciate the opportunity to report to you again on the
activities of the Tax Policy Committee.
Since the Vice Chairman of our Committee, Frederick Barbour
of Rohm and Haas, reported to you in September of 1975, we have
been concerned primarily with the legislative activity which led
up to enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 on October 4.
Last year when the House Ways and Means Committee conducted
.'ts h aring on tax reform, I had the honor to testify on behalf
fj£ th Association.
After passing the House late in 1975, the Tax Reform Act
was referred to the senate where it underwent hearings in the
Senate Finance Committee this past Spring.
At that time, as you
will recall, Mr. F. Perry Wilson, Chairman of the Board of
Union Carbide, appeared on behalf of the Association.
Our testimony before both committees was devoted to two
principal areas - namely, capital formation and taxation of
foreign source income.
in the capital formation area we recommended the adoption
of such tax incentives as making the 10% investment tax credit
permanent, reducing the corporate income tax rate, and providing
additional cost recovery allowances. We contended these actions
are needed to assist industry to generate sufficient funds
internally to meet capital requirements.
in the foreign area we recommended that no change be made in
the foreign tax credit provisions, and none with respect to the
timing of the imposition of U.S. tax on foreign earnings of foreign
subsidiaries; the so-called "deferral" issue.
In order to stimulate
<ports and to improv our balanc
of payments position, we also
'ecommended that the DISC be retained.
CMA 037127
2
The Tax Reform Act as finally enacted (P.L. 94-455) is a
massive document containing many hundreds of provisions which will
touch every taxpayer, corporate and individual, in the country.
I understand that Bill Stover briefed you gentlemen in September
on the more significant provisions of the bill as agreed to by the
House-Senate conference committee.
As these provisions remained
basically unchanged on final passage of the legislation, 1 will
point out a few areas which the new law does not address.
j
I
i
Aside from extending the
investment tax credit through 1980,
the Act does little to assist capital formation.
Although a task
force of the House Ways and Means Committee, headed by Chairman
A1 Ullman of Oregon, conducted a study to consider the use of the
tax code to stimulate capital formation, it has not yet published
its report.
j
i
In the foreign source income area, the new tax law has a
numb r of disturbing provisions, but it did not deal to any basic
extent with the two items of major concern to industry, namely the
timing of taxation of foreign source income (so-called deferral)
and the foreign tax credit.
You will recall that a group of tax
reform-minded Senators sponsored amendments to require current
taxation of the income of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies
and to change the foreign tax credit to a deduction, but their
proposals were all defeated.
f
The House ways and Means Committee also set up a task force,
headed by Representative Rostenkowski, (D-Ill.), to study the
taxation of foreign income.
No report has been issued and we
have no indication as to what recommendations are likely to be
forthcoming.
Considering the initial attitude of the 94th
Congress, we believe our industry was most fortunate to emerge
with the major tax provisions affecting foreign source income
relatively intact.
f
1
The MCA Tax Policy Committee has also been active with
resp ct to recent rule-making proposals initiated by the internal
Revenue Service.
we have been particualrly concerned with a proposal to amend
Section 861 of the Income Tax Regulations, which relates to the
allocation and apportionment of deductions for income tax purposes.
As you will recall, without the benefit of change in the law or
court decisions, in 1973 the Treasury Department proposed revis d
regulations which would cause most companies to lose substantial
i
t

f

foreign tax credits.
MCA went on record in 1973 and again in 1974
opposing the regulations and recommending that they be withdrawn.
Because of industry's strong opposition, these proposed regulations
were never finalized.
Within the past year there has been a great deal of renewed
governmental activity regarding these regulations and the internal
Revenue Service and the Treasury Department appeared anxious to
finalize them,
in the meantime, the Economic Policy Board became
interested in the 861 issue.
That Board established a task force
composed of representatives of a number of Federal agencies,
including the Departments of Commerce and Treasury and the Council
on international Economic Policy, to study the problem.
During the past year the Treasury Department proposed a series
of compromises aimed at overcoming industry opposition to the
proposed regulations.
Members of our Tax Policy Committee have had
a number of meetings with representatives of Treasury and the Council
on international Economic Policy concerning the regulations and
*h suggested Treasury revisions.
It was the opinion of a majority of the Tax Policy Committee
members that the Treasury Department's suggested changes to the
1973 proposed regulations did not go far enough to make the
regulations acceptable to the chemical industry.
Therefore, we have
continued to oppose the proposed regulations.
Our opposition has
been directed primarily at those provisions of the regulations
which would require that a portion of domestic R & D expense be
allocated against a company’s foreign income,
in the case of a
company with large R & D expenditures, this could have the effect
of substantially reducing that company's foreign tax credit,
resulting in significant double taxation.I
I might mention that there was a minority view within the
Tax policy Committee recommending support for the Treasury
proposal to reissue the proposed regulations in modified form
providing we made it clear that we reserved the right to object
to the proposed regulations after we have had an opportunity to
study them.
This view was based on the thought that the revised
proposal represented a substantial improvement over the original
1973 proposal.
This view was not shared by the majority of our
Committee.
CMA 037129
Because of a united front on these questions by many organiza­
tions including MCA, The Machinery and Allied Products institute,
the National Foreign Trade Council and others, we understood the
issu was dead for 1976.
We were quite surprised, therefore, when
the internal Revenue Service published the revised regulations in
proposed form on November 8th.
We understand that this action was
taken by the Treasury Department without clearing the subject with
the Economic Policy Board.
The new proposals are quite complicated and our member companies
are currently studying them to determine their effect.
It is apparent
that the impact can be different from company to company dependent
upon various business factors and we anticipate differences of
i
opinion as to whether MCA should support or oppose the provisions.
A written statement will be prepared based on comments to be received
from our members by November 29th.
Public hearings will be held in
Washington on December 16th and it is anticipated that a representaI
tive of the Tax Policy Committee will appear.
In conclusion, I would like to state that we faced 1976 with
a great deal of trepidation as to the final effect of the Tax
Reform Act of 1976.
We were quite active in attempting to present
the chemical industry's viewpoint and feel quite relieved to have
come through the year as well as we did.
We now face the coming year in anticipation of greater tax
activity.
Our goal remains to obtain legislation to aid in capital
formation and, hopefully, an enlightened attitude in congress with
regard to the necessity to maintain our competitiveness abroad.
We are commencing this year with hearing activity on the Section
861 Regulations and anticipate further activity as regulations on
the Boycott and illegal Payments provisions are published.
In other words, your Tax Policy Committee has had a busy
year and expects to remain active and vigilant in the year ahead.
I want to thank you gentlemen for the support you have given
us and I will answer any questions you might wish to ask.

ULLMAN AT THE CHEMICAL FORUM
Featured speaker at today's CHEMICAL FORUM luncheon will be
the Honorable A1 Uliman (D.-Ore.), Chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee. Since replacing Wilbur Mills as leader of this
powerful Committee in 1973, Mr. Ullman has succeeded in putting
his own personal stamp of its methods and achievements. The
critical issues of tax reform, trade regulation, energy conser­
vation, pension reform and Congressional budget lie within the
jurisdiction of Ways and Means. Most central to our interests
today will be Congressman Ullman's comments on the forthcoming
Carter economic stimulus package and how it is likely to be re­
ceived by the Congress. He is expected to take questions from
the audience at the conclusion of his remarks.
SENATE AND HOUSE CONVENE
The 95th Congress began on January 4 as Members of the House
and Senate gathered to elect new leaders and to commence an am­
bitious program of organization, reorganization and legislative
problem-solving.
In scarcely more than a week, the Congress:
- elected new leaders (four new faces in the five top
leadership posts);
- began work on rules changes and reorganization plans
(House procedural changes are aimed primarily at fa­
cilitating consideration of legislation on the floor,
while Senate reorganization is a potentially farreaching consolidation of committee jurisdictions);
CMA 037146
2
- began Senate confirmation hearings on Carter Cabinet
choices;
- introduced a flood of bills (some 1,400 introduced
on the first day in the House of Representatives alone);
- engaged in the process of assigning members to commit­
tees and determining chairmanships (the House could
complete committee assignments by January 19, but the
Senate will require considerably longer to finalize
its structure; the massive reorganization plan under
consideration by the Senate Rules Conmittee will cause
delay and until its fate is determined the freshmen
Senators have been given temporary assignments decided
by chance).
PRESIDENT FORD REMAINS ACTIVE
Amid preparations for the delivery of his final State-of-theUnion message January 12, President Ford has found time to submit
a number of policy proposals for public consideration and possible
Congressional action. In recent days he has:
- proposed that Puerto Rico be granted Statehood;
- sent to the Congress a major tax reduction message which
calls for a $10 billion cut in personal income taxes and
$2.5 billion in corporate tax cuts; few observers expect
the proposal to be seriously considered, but it may serve
as a yardstick against which to measure the scope of
President-elect Carter's economic stimulus package;
- submitted to the Congress a comprehensive energy message
which emphasized the importance of prompt action, while
warning against "easy answers" and opposing a sharply
expanded Federal role in energy matters;
readied a proposal to lift gasoline price controls.

president-elect carter reveals outlines of economic stimulus
package and other legislative timetables
While continuing to meet with and make decisions on prospective
office-holders for his Administration, President-elect Carter re­
vealed the general shape of his taxes/jobs plan designed to stimu­
late the U. S. economy in early 1977. Though details are not
finalized, the key elements of this two year and $30 billion
package appear to be:
- a goal of returning 800,000 persons to work, thereby
cutting unemployment figures by 17* in each of '77 and
- an increase in the standard deduction (worth $4 billion);
- deductions in payroll tax payments for business (worth
- simplification of the tax forms (reportedly to be a
major responsibility of Laurence Woodworth, Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy-designate);
- expansion of certain public works programs ($2 billion);
- increased grants to cities (in the neighborhood of $1
The Carter plan has already drawn criticism from the AFL-CIO,
elements of the news media and figures on Capitol Hill who char­
acterize It as cautious, too slow, and lacking in direct jobs
creation.
Meanwhile, key.Carter aides have revealed the broad outlines
of his legislative timetables. They hope that by February 3, legis­
lation can be submitted which would set up an overall energy de­
partment and enable the new President to begin broad reorganization
of the Executive Branch.
By April 20 the new Administration will
submit a message outlining energy and environmental issues. May 1
is the deadline for a draft of legislation designed to bring about
reform of the welfare system. The economic recovery and stimulation
program is more immediate, however, with the Carter blueprint ex­
pected to be sent to the Congress by the end of January. Congres­
sional leaders of both the House and Senate have pledged to give
it early attention.
CMA037147
SECTION 861 REGULATIONS APPROVED
On January 3 the Commissioner of Internal Revenue approved new
income tax regulations relating to the allocation and apportionment
of deductions to gross income to determine taxable income from
sources within and without the United States -- the sorcalled
Section 861 Regulations.
Initially proposed in 1973, they were withdrawn and reproposed
in revised form last November. MCA submitted written comments
strongly opposing the 1973 proposal, then testified at a public
hearing in 1974, recommending that the proposed rules be withdrawn.
The revised proposed regulations issued last November met a number
of our earlier objections, but still contained provisions which we
considered burdensome. We then submitted written comments on the
revised proposal, questioning the issuance of regulations in the
absence of enabling legislation and recommending additional changes.
A member of our Tax Policy Committee presented our testimony at an
IRS hearing in mid-December.
The final regulations are substantially similar to those issued
last November, but certain clarifying amendments were adopted.
Basically, they will cause an increase in the amount of deductions,
expenses and losses of U. S. taxpayers required to be allocated
to foreign gross income. The allowable foreign tax credit will
be proportionately reduced, because taxable income from sources
abroad determined under the new rules will almost always be less
than that which would be determined under the old regulations.
The effect of the new regulations on individual companies is
likely to vary widely depending on factors such as the scope of
foreign operations, the quantity of research and development ac­
tivity performed within the United States, and the amount of
domestic interest expense.
In late November, the Tax Policy Committee was polled on the
strategy question of whether or not to request a delay for the
submission of comments on the new revised regulations. The Com­
mittee opinion was evenly divided and no consensus could be
reached.
r
Now that the regulations have been finalized, some member
compani s may wish to chall nge the legality of th r gulatlons
through independent litigation. We do not anticipate further MCA
action with regard to the 861 Regulations at the pr sent time.

ENERGY CONSERVATION GOAL
The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 requires the
Federal Energy Administration to set energy conservation goals
for the ten most energy-intensive industries, ours being first
and foremost. FEA engaged contractors to carry on studies and
propose goals. The contractor in our case was Battelle Memorial
Institute, with Chem Systems as a sub-contractor.
Initially,
Battelle arrived at a figure of 15.67, energy conservation per
unit of output by January 1, 1980, as compared with 1972. FEA
rounded this out to a goal of 167,, and scheduled a hearing on it
for December 7. Shortly before the hearing, Battelle revised its
figure to 14.17,. Accordingly, Ronald S. Wishart, Jr., Chairman
of MCA's Energy Conservation Committee, testified in support of
a 147. goal. We understand from reliable sources that FEA has
decided on the 147, figure; however, this has not yet been of­
ficially proclaimed. The FEA has until January 21 to make its
formal announcement.
A 147. goal by January 1, 1980, would be virtually identical
with our earlier consensus goal of 157., since this was to have
been achieved in calendar 1980, a little later.
Incidentally,
the achievement of the goal is not mandatory, although failure
to do so could obviously incur public and Congressional relations
problems.
50 TOP ENERGY-CONSUMING COMPANIES IDENTIFIED
EPCA requires FEA to identify the top fifty energy-consuming
companies in each of the ten most energy intensive industries.
The lists were published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of December 16.
Some 46 of the 50 chemical companies listed are MCA members.
Of
these, 42 are taking part in our voluntary energy conservation
reporting program.
The other four are companies whose major out­
put is in areas other than basic industrial chemicals, and they
are reporting through other trade associations.
The companies so listed would be subject to mandatory in­
dividual reporting, unless exempted through participation in an
industry-wide voluntary program, such as MCA's.
To secure such
exemption, both the trade association concerned and the partici­
pating companies individually have to file requests with FEA.
CMA 037149
MCA did so in December, 1976. Having advance information on the
MCA member companies to be listed, MCA notified them on December
13, providing a sample letter to be sent to FEA.
It is believed
that all concerned MCA member companies have responded, and that
our participating companies will be able to carry on the report­
ing program as before, with minor revisions.
Exhibit D
report to the board of directors
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
JOHN J. MOYNA, CHAIRMAN
FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC CHEMICALS COMMITTEE
JANUARY 11,
1977
I welcome this opportunity to acquaint you with some of the
areas of our Committee's concern in the past year and some of the
legal and regulatory problems confronting the Food Additive and
pharmaceutical segments of the industry in the year ahead.
In the area of major new legislation, we anticipate that
Congress will act on the Food Surveillance Bill.
This Bill was
passed by the Senate in 1976 and was under active consideration by
the Rogers Committee in the House when Congress adjourned.
Among
its principal provisions is a requirement for the registration with
FDA of all plants which manufacture foods or food chemicals.
It
k’ill also impose on every segment of the food processing industry
rthe obligation of self-policing by each manufacturer's establishment
and adherence to adequate safety assurance procedures appropriate to
his plant.
These procedures are to identify areas in the manufac­
turing process in which product adulteration is likely or possible
and set forth and implement effective measures to reduce or elimi­
nate* the risk of adulteration.
The 1976 Senate Bill offered no
guidelines on determining the "adequacy" of the safety assurance
procedures and the vagueness of the new law may present substantial
compliance problems.
Another important area which the Senate Bill addressed and
which, we believe. Congress will act upon in 1977, is the impact of
the U.S. Supreme Court decision in U.S. v. Park.
in the Park case,
the Supreme Court ruled that a corporate executive could be prose­
cuted under the criminal provisions of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic
Act for product adulteration, irrespective of his personal ignorance
of the situation causing the adulteration and however remote his
involvement in that situation.
The Court thus imposed absolute
criminal liability based merely upon the responsibility of individual
corporate officers for certain areas of activity.
The Consumer Food
legislation would limit the criminal responsibility of executives to
those situations in which the adulteration arose from some negli­
gence or intentional conduct on the part of the responsible company
CMA 037151
official.
In the same vein, the Food & Drug Administration will
issue regulations implementing and defining its policy under the
Park decision.
Our Committee will be following both those develop­
ments very closely.
Other requirements of the new legislation will
be extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements and coding
and labeling requirements designed to expedite recalls.
In the regulatory areas, FDA has already published proposed
regulations for good laboratory practices designed to insure the
accuracy and sufficiency of test data submitted to the Agency in
support of new drug applications, food and color additive petitions
and similar applications where FDA approval is required.
Our involved
subcommittees will undertake to determine the appropriateness of
submitting comments on these proposed regulations.
Additional areas of regulatory activity and concern will
include FDA's GRAS review of food chemicals—a subject on which our
Committee has submitted extensive comments in the past—and the po­
tential impact of the Toxic Substances Legislation upon Food, Drug,
& Cosmetic Chemicals.
I would like to say a few words on the latter
subject.
Upon initial review of£he Toxic Substances legislation, many
of the regulatory affairs and legal people in the pharmaceutical
and food industries took comfort from what seemed to be a total
exemption from coverage accorded to foods, drugs and cosmetics.
On
closer scrutiny, however, it becomes apparent that intermediate chem­
icals used in the manufacture of finished food additives and drugs
may well be covered by the new law.
The question of the applicability
of the Toxic Substances legislation to drug and food chemical inter­
mediates requires early resolution because of the consequences which
attend non-inclusion of a chemical in EPA’s inventory of "old"
chemical substances under the Act.
If, in fact, all intermediates
are covered by the new law, pharmaceutical and food chemical manu­
facturers will probably be required to report all intermediates to
EPA in order to avoid the consequences of new chemical status.
Hope­
fully, our Committee will be able to make some input to EPA on this
important question.
EPA has requested suggestions of all interested
persons on its prospective administration of the Toxic Substances
Law and plans to hold a number of public hearings to solicit further
comment.
So much for the year ahead.
I would.like to comment very
CMA 037162
I
briefly on our Committee's activities for the past year.
The
Committee drafted recommended comments for MCA on the PDA's recall
regulations in September of 1976.
MCA had previously commented
on the Agency's general procedural regulations governing adminis­
trative hearings.
These comments represent a considerable commit­
ment of time and effort on the part of individual members of our
Committee.
In its final administrative procedure regulations, FDA
recognized the validity of many of our points and indicated that
its implementation of the regulations would take into account the
concerns we expressed.
The effectiveness of our Committee—and of MCA—as an industry
voice is to some extent limited by the limited time in which to submit
comments to the Agency and the MCA committee structure itself, which .
relies almost completely on the work product of the committee members.
In the last regard, I believe that the Committee's effectiveness
could be enhanced by more direct MCA staff involvement with FDA
representatives on issues of general interest and by more active
staff participation in the preparation of written input on Agency
proposals.
This is intended as recognition of limitations inherent
in MCA's method of operation, not as a reflection on the staff.
I am grateful for this opportunity to give you some idea of
our Committee's activities and concerns and welcome any specific
questions you may have.
CMA 037153
Exhibit E
MCA Industrial Relations Advisory Committee Report
to the
Board of Directors
January 11, 1977
John J. Radigan, Chairman
In September 1975 I had the privilege of speaking to the
Board of Directors to report on the industrial Relations Advisory
Committee's activities.
At that time, I took a few minutes to
crystal-ball what I saw in the near future in the broad area of
industrial relations.
As I indicated in my projections, we have
seen relatively high inflation continue through 1976, coupled with
high increases in wages at all levels.
New and improved fringe
ben fits, including dental plans, have become commonplace, and we
hav witnessed a strong push for job security, fueled by the reces­
sion.
In my opinion, even though inflation has slowed down, and
hop fully will continue to do so, wages will rise in excess of the
current level of inflation, and fringe benefits together with job
s curity will become the main thrust of organized labor.
Other
forms of insurance programs, such as those covering automobiles and
legal fees, will reach the bargaining table.
As to job security, we shall see in the next three to five
years a definite major breakthrough in this area, which will spill
over into most of our major companies and industries with such in­
novations as guaranteed work weeks, no time cards, etc.
A key
negotiation to watch in this regard is that between the basic steel
industry and the United Steelworkers of America.
The initial session
is scheduled for February 14, and they will continue voluntary negotia­
tions until April 20, at which time any unresolved national contract
issues will be submitted to arbitration under the Experimental
Negotiation Agreement.
The arbitration panel is to issue its decision
no later than July 10.
Security is shaping up as a major item,
since cost-of-living protection and a standard-of-living increase are
foregone conclusions.
This includes "income" security and "employ­
ment" security and could include cost-of-living adjustments on
vacations, pensions, and insurance benefits and further restrictions
on contracting-out of work.
A shorter work week and additional paid
days off could also be in th
picture.
Although there has b en a great deal of talk about co-determina­
tion and works councils migrating from Europe, i do not think they
CMA 037154
will become a part of our industrial life here in the United Staf-as,
at least not in the near future - and, if at all, not in the same
form as we are experiencing in Europe.
Two other areas which will stand out for increased future
activity are occupational safety and health and equal employment
opportunity.
Whether you have unions or not, your employees are
becoming more aware of their rights in these areas,
if you have
unions, many are building technical staffs in the safety, hygiene,
and health fields to aid their locals in auditing the safety of
our work places.
Several companies in our industry have experienced
employee health crises in the last year, with the resulting employee
and public relations problems.
We must be prepared to devote more
management time and resources to avoid further employee anxieties
about the safety of their work locations.
As for OSHA itself. Dr.
Corn, who now heads it, has attempted to bring a balance to the
agency, stressing education rather than only compliance.
i
Under the best of circumstances, those of us with unions can
i
expect to hear more about health and safety in future negotiations.
Unions are impatient with OSHA.
Indeed, one, - the Oil, Chemical, and
Atomic Workers - is suing OSHA.
We should expect that this impatience
will result in a more direct approach with employers, including
demands for safety committees with authority, use of union safety
consultants in our plants, and higher visibility for such union(
oriented medical consultants as Dr. Irving Selikoff, who has
recently been featured at union conventions, including those of
the OCAW and the international chemical Workers Union.
The equal employment field is another fast-changing one.
Initially, most union leadership stayed far afield of employers'
equal employment activities, and understandably:
most of their
membership was white and male and didn't advocate or want much
change.
But, as our efforts to better utilize minorities and
females have been successful, these same unions are now respond­
ing to this growing minority and female membership in several ways.
The grievance procedure has always been available to resolve
problems, including those of alleged discrimination.
But we haven't
seen anything yet.
Hourly employees in increasing numbers are
utilizing all available forums to resolve their discrimination com­
plaints - grievance procedures, local and state human rights com­
missions, the EEOC, the employer's compliance agency, as well as
private equal employment groups.
Union leadership will push to
become more involved in our equal employment opportunity efforts,
partly out of a new interest and partly to protect themselves from
discrimination charges from their new female and minority members.
CMA 037156
This will continue to burden us with time-consuming and expensive
Investigations and litigations.
However, I forecast an even more
difficult time as the concept of affirmative action is applied to
the employment and upgrading of professional employees.
Our
abilities as managers to plan, organize, control, evaluate and
motivate will be tested as never before.
There follow detailed reports on particular areas of the
Committee's interest.
The Outlook for Labor Legislation in the New Congress
Spokesmen for organized labor have declared that they are
going to give over-riding priority to measures to revive the
economy and reduce unemployment, rather than to their own
parochial interests.
It is clear that the incoming Administra­
tion is similarly inclined, though not clear whether it is as
enthusiastic as labor in support of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill.
However, after the Administration and the Congress have
done what they can about unemployment, the unions will be pressing
the
nactment of measures of particular interest to them, with
greater hope of success in view of the makeup of the Congress and
the leading role labor played in the Carter victory.
The unions'
lengthy shopping list includes:
Fair Labor Standards Act - Bills will be introduced to increase
the minimum hourly wage, with $3.00 a likely short-term target.
In addition, proposals will be made to index the minimum wage by
tieing it to wage movements generally or to the Consumer Price
Index.
As a consequence of the current high rate of unemployment,
which seems likely to prevail through 1977, bills will be introduced
with the stated objective of spreading the available work by increas­
ing the present 50% overtime premium for hours worked over forty per
Proposals also will be made under the Walsh-Healey
Public Contracts Act to raise the present 50% premium for hours
worked in excess of eight per day to 100%.
National Labor Relations Act - Our success via Presidential
veto in opposing common situs picketing in 1976 may be short-lived.
Bills are certain to be introduced to legalize secondary boycotts
at construction sites; i.e., to permit one union to picket an entire
project involving several employers and unions.
Further, there will
likely be a serious attempt to repeal Section 14(b), the so-called
"right to work" provision under which 20 states (predominantly in
the south) have banned compulsory union membership clauses.
Bills
will be pressed to speed up NLRB proc sses.
For example, to make
CMA 037156
the recommended orders of administrative law judges (formerly,
trial examiners) self-executing and final, subject to appeal
upon grant of certiorari by the Labor Board (meaning the Board at
its discretion may entertain appeal).
Currently, even orders of
the Board are not self-executing; rather, the Board must petition
a Circuit Court of Appeals for enforcement of orders.
Equal Employment Opportunity - Bills are likely to be introduce^
which would confer upon the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
much of the power enjoyed by the National Labor Relations Board;
i.e., to make determinations that unfair employment practices have
been committed.
EEOC presently is authorized to investigate and
conciliate discrimination charges and, where it is unsuccessful
in conciliation, to institute suit against the alleged violators.
The Supreme Court recently decided that employers need not as a
matter of law equate pregnancy leave and disability leave insofar
as pay continuation or insured benefits are concerned.
While this
decision lifted the threat of substantial back-pay liability from
employers, it will spur the filing of bills to compel employers in
the future to fully equate pregnancy leave and disability leave.
Unemployment Compensation - There will be a strong push to
impose upon the state-administered system a set of Federal minimum
benefits standards (i.e., to set a floor, not a ceiling).
Workers Compensation - Here, too, the matter of Federal benefits
standards will be pressed.
At least equal attention will be given
to imposing Federal standards for coverage of occupational diseases.
Conceivably the latter standards might include presumption of the
occupational nature of disease, absent proof to the contrary; i.e.,
mer
employment in the vicinity of a given substance would give rise
to the presumption.
Plant Closing or Relocation Controls - Some attempt is likely to
revive the proposal made in the previous Congress requiring employers
to give advance notice (as much as two years) of plant closings
and/or relocations.
Such legislation would give the Labor Depart|
ment the power to hold public hearings and to deprive the employer of
tax benefits (e.g., investment tax credit, deferral of tax on foreign
income) where a closing or relocation was found unjustified.
This
proposal seems so extreme as to render passage most unlikely.
Howeveiii*
it is entirely conceivable that Congress may authorize a study of
plant relocations by major employers.
The study might well extend
I
beyond the U. S. to include the alleged "export" of jobs by U.S.-based!
multinational firms.

pensions. Social Security, and Health Insurance
The new pension legislation became effective in 1976.
All
private pension plans had to be adjusted to conform with it.
The three major areas of adjustment were: (1) vesting; (2) funding?
and (3) making joint survivorship mandatory in all plans.
The
basic intention was to assure sound funding and widow's benefits
for all private plans.
An unintended effect has been a high
number of pension plan terminations by small employers due to the
high cpst of administration.
This will probably call for some
revisions in the legislation during 1977.
The social security system has operated in the red for the
past two years.
Although the 94th Congress ultimately took no
action, seemingly the 95th Congress will have to do something to
cope with the continuing flow of red ink.
Industry for the most
part is resigned to acceptance of an increase in the tax rate (now
11.796) and taxable wage base ($16,500 in 1977) — the latter to move
with wages and salaries generally.
However, there is strong senti­
ment among some legislators to tap general revenues and/or to dis­
pense with any ceiling on the taxable wage base (but without com­
mensurate increase in benefits for higher-paid persons).
. No change is in the offing in the age requirements for receipt
of old age benefits under Social Security.
However, the concept of
mandatory retirement at any given age under privately-sponsored pen­
sion plans is coming under increasing fire from social scientists
and others.
Thus, it is possible that Congress may authorize a study
of the mandatory retirement age concept which ultimately (but not in
1977) could be the basis for legislation affecting this provision of
most pension plans.
The coming year is likely to bring adjustments in the Medicare
and Medicaid areas, due to the escalating costs of medical services.
There will be many proposals in the national health insurance
area, ranging from the equivalent of catastrophic illness coverage
to complete coverage.
There will be considerable range, too, in the
degree of employer financial support required under the various pro­
posals.
With the Carter Administration committed to action in this
field, enactment sooner or later of some national health insurance
plan seems certain,
it could conceivably be enacted in 1977, to be
effective in 1978.
However, in view of the cost consequences to the
Federal budget - and also with an eye to the most propitious timing
politically - enactment could well be delayed until 1978.

OSHA Developments
Upon his appointment as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Oc­
cupational Safety and Health a .year ago, Morton Corn immediately
set about to make the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
a more professional organization.
The perception of OSHA by the
public, government, and industry at the time was highly unflattering.
Morton Corn has not yet succeeded in reversing that view, but is
determined to do so.
He has made headway toward making OSHA a more
comp tent organization.
If he remains in the office under the
Carter Administration, he will continue to increase the technical
competence of the OSHA staff, to work for reorganization of the
agency and to seek cooperation from both labor and industry in
setting standards.
In short, Morton Corn is making OSHA a new
and different kind of organization.
The full impact of these
changes on industry is yet to be known, but stepped-up activity on
a more professional level is certain.
i
OSHA has a proposal under consideration to allow certain compani s to establish their own Federally-approved safety programs.
As proposed, this program would establish three groups of employers:
those who would be required to comply with OSHA standards; those
who could deviate from OSHA standards on a standard-by-standard
basis; and those who could establish their own safety programs after
a probationary period.
OSHA's examination of this proposed program
apparently was generated by a finding that 70-80% of all deaths and
injuries in industry are not attributable to violations of OSHA
specification or performance standards.
The proposed program is
aimed at encouraging companies not only to meet OSHA standards, but
to have a safety education and training program, to have sufficient,
qualified safety personnel, to have employee participation in the
safety program, etc.
Whether or not a company adequately meets
these and other criteria would, of course, be decided by OSHA.
Com­
panies given less than the top rating by OSHA could expect to hear
from their employees and their unions.
Equal Employment Opportunity
A Supreme Court decision (McDonald vs. Santa Fe Transportation)
affirmed that white persons may seek relief under Title VII for
racial discrimination.
The court rules that the terms of Title VII
are not limited to discrimination against members of any particular
race and that the 1866 Civil Rights Act was meant to state a broad
principle of racial
quality that applies equally to whites and
blacks.
This decision makes it likely that white employees, espe­
cially thos
who have personally lost out because of "affirmative
action," will become bolder in filing charges.
Still to be con­
sidered is the qu stion of whether or not mandated affirmative

action constitutes bias against whites.
in Franks vs. Bowman Transportation, the Supreme Court ruled
that an employee should be credited with a seniority date back to
his original date of application as a remedy for a proven Title VII
violation.
Although Title VII expressly permits bona fide seniority
to rule in employment decisions, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) asserts that no seniority system can be' bona fid
if it deprives a disproportionate number of protected-class members
of employment.
This issue is still pending on remand to the Third
Circuit by the U. S. Court (Jersey Central Power & Light case).
N w Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP)
regulations on veterans' employment and revised regulations on
handicapped persons' employment were issued, defining the obliga­
tions of Federal contractors and sub-contractors to take affirma­
tive action for the covered classes.
Proposed revision of regulations for enforcing executive order
11246 aroused controversy because a number of civil rights groups
see these as less demanding than present regulations.
Many industry
representatives, in fact, prefer the present regulations.
The pro­
posed revisions would allow OFCCP to investigate individual charges
of discrimination, such as presently handled by EEOC under Title VII,
and to assess back pay for classes where disparate treatment is found
by OFCCP.
The issue whether 11246 authorizes back-pay demands is
currently in litigation.
MCA on the recommendation of its Industrial Relations Advisory
Committee joined other employers and employer associations in
funding the work of the recently-established Equal Employment Advisory
Committee.
This unique organization fills two roles critical to the
employer community not filled by any other organization:
pation on an amicus curiae basis in significant litigation when im­
portant employer positions are at issue (the council has participated
in more than 15 such cases in the last two years); and (2) undertaking
and publishing demographic and other studies to assist employers in
complying with the-law and spirit of the Equal Employment Opportunity
laws.
This organization is effectively fulfilling its assigned
mission and our continued support is important and recommended.
University Relations and College Recruitment
Statistics based on the analysis of information received from
since
1971, the number of chemists graduating from college has held fairly
constant, but the number of chemical engineers has been declining
AichE, ACS, and the Engineers Joint Council indicate that,
CMA 037160
r
since 1970.
Therefore, a shortage of chemical engineers is expent^
for at least the next couple of years.
j
Some recent statistics, however, indicate a rather notable
switchover of sophomores and juniors into engineering disciplines,
which might end the shortage of chemical engineers sooner than
anticipated.
i
Female BS chemistry graduates in 1973 amounted to 17.9% of
the total graduating.
This increased to 20.9% in 1975.
Female
chemical engineering graduates increased from 2.8% in 1973 to
Minority chemical engineers are still extremely
few, and will amount to slightly more than 1% of the total graduates
in 1976.
International Labor Organization
For a number of years members of our Committee have maintained
contact with the ILO through the International Chemical Employers
Labor Relations Committee, which is in effect the caucus for ILO
purposes of chemical employers throughout the world.
This year was
of particular importance, because there was held in February in
Geneva an ILO Chemical industries Committee meeting, the first since
1969.
Like all ILO meetings, this was organized on a tripartite
basis - with labor, management and government representatives.
Some 23 nations took part in the Committee meeting, each
delegation consisting of two from management, two from labor, and
two from government.
David C. Williams of the MCA staff and I
were the U. S. management representatives.
Two areas of discussion were assigned to the meeting: the
chemical industries and their working environment; and the manpower
aspects of establishing chemical industries in developing countries.
The report of the meeting is on file at the MCA office.
In
both areas of discussion, items of controversy between labor and
manag ment arose.
With regard to the report on the working environ­
ment, the employers successfully resisted a union drive for an
endorsement of joint health and safety committees with decision­
making powers, maintaining that they should have consultative
functions only,
in the manpower report, the employers successfully
resisted a union drive for a statement discouraging the practice of
contracting out or subcontracting jobs, in particular contracts to
provide labor.
CMA 037161
Apart from their work on the reports, the employers were also
successful, with the help of the American union delegates, in
killing a resolution offered by Communists among the worker
delegates, seeking to launch an attack upon multinational corpora­
tions.
At this time, it is problematical whether the United States
will remain in the ILO. However, the Chamber of Commerce,which
represents US management in the ILO, has taken the position that,
so long as we are members, we should be fully active, particularly
in seeking needed reforms.
This appears to me the proper position
for MCA to maintain.
NLRB Developments
The NLRB General Counsel is having some success with his inter
pretation of the Freedom of Information Act.
The Federal courts
have held that an employer, against whom unfair labor practice proce dings are pending before the NLRB, is not entitled, under the
Freedom of Information Act, to the disclosure of statements of
witnesses obtained by Board agents during the course of the investi
gation into the underlying charges.
There has been a
plethora of litigation on this point.
The NLRB has won some and
lost some; however, at this time, the General Counsel has prevailed
in'most of the litigation.
The NLRB Chairman appointed a Task Force about one year ago.
Its job was to undertake a review and evaluation of the existing
structure, practices, procedures, rules and regulations for the
investigation, prosecution, hearing, decision and enforcement of
cases filed with the National Labor Relations Board.
The Task
Force has been in existence for one year and appears to be doing
a rather thorough job.

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
GEORGE DOMINGUEZ, CHAIRMAN
CHEMICAL REGULATIONS ADVISORY COMMITTEE
FEBRUARY 8,
1977
The Chemical Regulations Advisory Committee (CRAC) is most
intensely active in preparing draft proposals for the Environ­
mental Protection Agency's (EPA) use, through its Office of
Toxic Substances (OTS), in drafting regulations and definitions
required on a time schedule established by the Toxic Substances
Control Act.
A series of weekly meetings provided EPA with
abbr viated views on basic concepts.
At EPA public meetings
December 14 and 15, prepared statements were read before an
audi nee of 700.
Later, statements were presented on more
detailed sections and issues of the law before smaller EPA
sponsored meetings.
In mid-January, MCA views were developed
for presentation to EPA on twelve "records and reports" issues
delineated by EPA.
In these and the weekly meetings, the views
presented were largely tentative, but increasingly convergent
I
on workable understanding through interaction with EPA.
As EPA
further clarifies its strategies, this frequency of meetings is
likely to increase, to complete implementation in 1977 as requir d by law.
*The results of these sessions are manifest in changed EPA
positions.
For example, EPA's earlier preference for a simple
numerical limit to "small quantities for research and develop­
ment" has shifted to MCA's view that flexibility is needed to
reflect realistic dissimilarities between diverse industries and
diff rent stages in research.
The agreed control is that the
manufacture or processing of such varied quantities be supervised
by professionally trained personnel informed about the health and
safety aspects of the specific material.
Still to be resolved is
the procedure for distribution or disposal of plant-scale trial
quantities.
Another example of progress is EPA's dropping its proposal
that impurities of substances be reported with annual production
volumes.
The EPA staff finally agreed that its proposal would
not meet cost/benefit analysis.
CMA 037191
2
Perhaps the most creative proposal tentatively accepted by
EPA is the system MCA proposed to maintain confidentiality of
the identity of certain substances considered to be bona fide
trade secrets,
coding identities by qualitative empirical
formula and molecular weight, this proposal has earned Initial
support by environmentalists.
Volunteer company members, in addition to CRAC’s member­
ship of thirty, have been readily accepted at work group levels,
assuring effective MCA representation in these frequent EPA
working sessions.
The January issue of MCA News carries a story
and picture of one of the work groups actively preparing posi­
tions on the development of the section 8(b) inventory list of
existing chemicals.
Simultaneously, three regional seminars have been organized
to help companies prepare for compliance.
The first of these
was held February 2 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was highly
successful in terms of attendance and of the number of searching
questions asked.
You may wish to alert your mid- and far-west
associates of the next two meetings, February 23 at St. Louis,
Missouri, and March 10 at San Francisco, California.

Exhibit F
MCA Government Relations Committee Report
to the Board of Directors
February 8, 1977
Don A. Goodall, chairman
A major premise of this report is that business is
not as influential in Washington as we would like it to
be nor as influential as we must be if any viable form
of private enterprise is to be preserved in this country.
It was not too many years ago that businessmen were
listened to with considerable attention by those members
of Congress who wore either a Republican or Southern Demo­
crat label.
But that is no longer the case. What happened?
When I first came to Washington in 1959 one of the
power houses on the Hill was Judge Smith of Virginia, am
Id school Southern Democrat and head of the then allpowerful House Rules Committee.
If he decided he didn't
want a bill passed, he wouldn't give it a rule permitting
it to go to the House floor,
if the pressure got too
gr at, he just went down to his farm to — as he used to
I'm not saying this was the right way to run the
government.
But it was a time when businessmen had more
influence in Congress than we have today.
But that day
went out with the one-man, one-vote drive that took place
more than a decade ago, and for a variety of other reasons.
For example, the politicizing of labor unions was
another contributing factor.
Beginning in 1948 with estab­
lishment of the Committee on Political Education, labor
moved into the political ring in a big way, convinced
that it could win in state legislatures and the Congress
what it could not win at the bargaining table.
Labor
money and labor manpower are now major factors in congres­
sional election campaigns.
And labor's lobbying muscle
on Capitol Hill is the envy of those of us on the business
side.
I
Television is another factor that has changed the
process of selecting and influencing Members of congress.
The medium puts a premium on an appearance of freshness,
f youthful vigor and vitality, and on the ability to
articulate ideas.
Furth rmore, the wide exposure TV gives
CMA 037193
to candidates tends to open up the selection process.
Another and more recent development has been the rise
of public interest groups.
They are dedicated and per­
severing.
A Member of Congress must be responsive to
their pressures or else he'll find himself facing more
competition for his seat in the next primary and general
elections.
Business has not been totally unresponsive to these
changing factors. With the rise of big government and
big labor after WWII, some large companies opened Wash­
ington offices to assure that their views were being
conveyed to Congress and the Administration.
At the
same time that the Washington corporate office was being
developed, by a relative handful of companies, 1 must add,
there was a parallel development of the trade association
as an instrument for communicating with government.
In
the last two decades, trade associations have become as
much a Washington growth phenomenon as government itself.
And finally, within the last few years we have even
seen the CEO coming to Washington to engage in direct
lobbying where an issue was of such paramount importance
to the corporation that it merited his personal attention.
This technique became so important, in fact, that the
Business Roundtable was formed expressly to assure organized
CEO involvement in the lobbying effort.
But the Washington corporate office and the trade
association and the CEO as lobbyists are not totally
responsive to today's need.
What business lacks is a grassroots voice.
Many
Members of Congress are candid in saying this to your
Washington corporate representative.
Right or wrong.
Members of Congress are telling us that opinions from
the corporate board room no longer carry the weight they
once did.
In the vernacular of Capitol Hill, they ask
"How many votes have you got?"
Unfortunately, too many in business fail to under­
stand that to a politician the vote tally on election day
tis the end-all and be-all, in the same manner as is to
you the bottom line on your corporate financial statement.
I
CMA 037194
3
How do we get a grassroots voice on Capitol Hill?
We start by developing two resources that presently are
largely untapped by business — employees and stockholders.
First, we give our employees an understanding of
how our businesses work# an understanding of the kind of
governmental climate that must exist for preservation of
private enterprise# and an understanding of how their
personal welfare relates to that of the corporation.
Lest anyone assume that this is not a bonafide need#
I quote from the January issue of The Conference Board
magazine# which said of the American people: "... they
misunderstand the relationships between prices and costs
and between real wages', productivity and capital invest­
ment; they overestimate the level of corporate profit
margins; and they believe that it is business# not people#
who pays the corporate income tax."
If we help our employees understand these things#
then they will see that their Congressional representatives
understand them.
The stockholder is not so much in need of economic
ducation as he is of being informed about how prospective
government actions will affect the return on his investment.
Once he has that information# communication with congress
will take care of itself.
Let me illustrate what I'm saying with a true story.
It involves Burt Talcott# a seven-term member of the House
of Representatives from California until his defeat last
November.
Mr. Talcott voted in line with the business
community position on issues about 80 percent of the time.
Conversely# labor gave him only a 13 percent favorable
vote rating.
In October 1975 a delegation of California businessmen
met with the California congressional delegation to express
its views on then pending legislation.
Afterwards# Mr.
Talcott wrote to these businessmen.
Let me quote from that
letter:
"As representatives of the people# w cannot (in a
practical or political sense) support an issue# or a
CMA 037195
bill, without support of people - the people
we directly represent.
We need support as you
need a market.
Your aim must be 'the people*.
There is no easy
way to leapfrog them to persuade a group of leg­
islators.
You can, you must, begin by persuading your employees- —
vour investors who are our constituents.
They
pack the political clout.
They can be mobilized;
but I, as a legislator, cannot do it -- at least
without vour help.
perhaps one of your union leaders should have
appeared with you.
One union leader would have
impressed more than half of our delegation.”
Mr. Talcott's advice to the California businessmen
was echoed by Rep. Barber conable of New York, one of the
brightest and most capable members of the House, when he
spoke not long ago to a group of Pfizer management personnel;
He counselled Pfizer to talk to its own people so that they
would understand why Mr. conable takes the positions he
does,
without such backup, Mr. conable is vulnerable.
Mr. Talcott's reference to a union leader doesn't mean
that union leaders are more persuasive than businessmen.
It simply means that from a congressman's perception, union
spokesmen presently represent more votes than we do.
That perception is certainly true in Mr. Talcott's
case.
He's no longer in Congress, thanks to labor union
and environmentalist political clout.
Bryce Harlow, counsellor to Presidents and Procter &
Gamble's Washington representative, has an interesting
concept of this matter of perceptions.
He says that when
a politician looks at you as a company executive, or me
as a Washington representative, or at MCA, he looks through
us — as though we were a window.
He wants to see what is
behind us to determine if we can hurt him or help him.
Too often, the politician sees nothing behind us and,
when he does, he knows he can ignore our views.
CMA 037196
5
Sd much then for the need for grassroots support
if our positions are to prevail in Washington.
It is
not my intent nor have we time for the mechanics of
how this will be accomplished.
Except that it will not be done by slick PR tech­
niques nor by writing a check once a year to some organiza­
tion that promises you it can "educate the American public
about free enterprise".
Now let me shift focus to another subject, but which
is related to all that l*ve said so far. like one side
of a coin is related to the other.
Business cannot be persuasive, either to its own
employees or to congress, if it lacks credibility.
And business has a credibility problem stemming from
such things as price fixing, bribery, and environmental
incidents.
I do not believe that, except for a few amoral
businessmen, today's corporate leaders consciously
condone breaking the law.
Rather, these things happen
because not enough attention is paid to establishing
controls that will prevent them.
And so I make this suggestion:
that every company
have a system of internal "auditing" which has the express
purpose of identifying for management potential problem
areas within the corporation.
Xt is my belief that
somewhere in any company there are always individuals
who know when the fine line of illegality is being crossed,
or some practice is being followed that is questionable
from an environmental, safety or health view.
There must
be a way for these people to report their concerns so
that management can take corrective steps before irre­
trievable damage is done -- both to the company and to
the business image.
I'm not advocating do-goodism.
Gulf's CEO announced
recently that it has set up a system that gives its divi­
sional finance officers an opportunity to report problem
Another MCA company. X'm told, has recently insti­
tuted an auditing procedure in the health and safety area.
So. this is a practical suggestion.
CMA 037197
In summary, I have suggested to you that we should
do two things to help preserve private enterprise; first,
enlist the participation of our employees and stockholders
and, second, establish an internal method for identifying
potential problem areas.
If you feel that these sugges­
tions have merit, the Government Relations Conmittee is
ready to work with you in designing a model program which
you can adapt to your own operations.

REPORT BY THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
WILLIAM M. STOVER
APRIL 12, 1977
CONGRESS IN RECESS BUT ACTIVITY CONTINUES AT HIGH LEVEL
The Congress is currently in a "district work period", a term
now used to describe the Easter Recess, from which they return
next Monday, April 18. There has been much recent activity,
however, and more important work awaits. The taxation portion of
the President's economic stimulus program has been approved by
the House, and the Senate Committee version is now ready for th
floor. Amendments to both the air quality and water quality laws
are approaching the latter stages of consideration.
Both the S nate
and House have recently approved detailed codes of ethics govern­
ing the conduct of the Members. Labor has sustained a surprising
defeat in House rejection of common situs picketing legislation,
a defeat which raises questions about the Carter Administration's
relationship with organized labor and prospects for other laborbacked bills.
At the White House, the activity has been equally intense.
The President recently signed into law the government reorganiz­
ation bill he has long sought. A comprehensive Administration
proposal on election reform has been sent to the Congress.
In
the near future, Mr. Carter is expected to send three more major
messages to Capitol Hill, one dealing with inflation, another on
his national energy program and a third on the environment.
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGES EXPECTED SOON
According to
mental message to
preliminary draft
public, the final
the original time-table, the President's environ­
Congress was due on April 1, but although a
from the Council on Environmental Quality became
text has not been issued.
CMA 037230
I
2
t
i
Moreover, there are, signs that the delay is due, at least in
part, to potential conflicts with elements of another major
Presidential program - the energy message, scheduled to be delivered
by the President April 20.
The close interrelationship and tradeoffs between energy and environmental concerns are well recognized,
as is the political volatility of each, factors which may have led
to late modifications.
The draft environmental message written for the President by
CEQ centers around 12 issues: oil pollution prevention, air and
water pollution control, protection of life and health, resource
conservation and recovery, assessment and improvement of environmental laws, energy, natural resources, living resources, global
environment, urban environment, and parks, recreation and wilderness. Early reports on the initial 100-page draft indicated that
it offered little in the way of compromises or trade-offs in the
interest of increased energy supply.
The energy message has apparently undergone some revision
in recent days, with rumors of a move away from mandatory acrossthe-board efficiency standards for industry, and toward efficiency
standards for industrial equipment by working with the manufacturers.
Regardless, it is certain that the mandatory approach is still
favored by some vocal and influential Members of Congress, and that
voluntary industrial efficiency programs or conservation efforts
will come under attack. The Carter plan is also expected to call
for a retrofit program to weatherize homes, performance-base
building codes for new building types, and energy-efficiency standards
for large appliances. Other possibilities include a surtax on
"gas-guzzling" vehicles, higher fuel economy goals for new cars
and a standby increase in the Federal gasoline tax.
Petroleum
controls will probably continue and vigorous efforts are likely
to reduce the use of natural gas as a fuel.
MCA TASK GROUP PREPARING PROGRAM ON WATER QUALITY LEGISLATION
Looking ahead toward future opportunities for needed amendment
of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, an MCA task group has
developed an action plan which will soon be launched.
This program is the work of the MCA Intercommittee Task Group
on Water Quality Legislation, which is chaired by Sam Pickard,
Vice president of Monsanto, with William S. Sneath, Chairman of
the Board of Union Carbide acting as Senior Advisor. The aim is
to marshal the communications skills, local impact and pertinent
data of the chemical industry so as to present a compelling case
to the Congress when major water quality legislation is next conCMA 037231

sidered. No dates are presently set for Congressional review, but
we are moving aggressively now, both to insure our preparedness
and to add impetus to the amending effort itself.
I
The focal point of the Task Group's work is this:
there is a
need to evaluate current and projected accomplishments in cleaning
up the nation's waters before moving on to the 1983 requirement
for installation of "Best Available Technology" controls. We
believe and will argue that once the 1977 standards (Best Practicable
Technology) are met by all sectors, it may not be in the national
interest to proceed to the technology-based 1983 standards in all
cases.
t
And so, the multi-faceted action program being readied places
its stress on our industry's commitment to achieving fishable,
swimmable waters by 1983 - and fishable, swimmable waters is the
stated goal of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (P.L. 92-500).
I
I
i
I
I
The active program of communications, preparation, and datacollection drafted by our Task Group will be set in motion this
month by a letter from Mr. Driver to the executive contacts of
MCA member companies. Here is its outline:
it encourages active participation of CEO's, middlemanagers and employees by providing ready-to-use inform­
ation - speech material, articles for publications,
data analyses, etc.
it encourages development of specific local data by each
company - perhaps even at each location - which will be
readily compiled, readily understandable and readily
applied to our basic arguments.
it encourages dialogue with a broad range of constituencies
and publics, including Congressmen, local communities,
public interest groups, labor, the media, and others.
I
i
j
While not a*certainty, we believe there is a possibility for
, constructive amendment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
' during the 95th Congress.
If we are to have a reasonable opportunity
i to achieve a measure of mid-course correction, it is essential that
i all member companies respond vigorously.
1 TAXES AND THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS
I
On Monday, March 28, the Senate Finance Committee filed the
I report on its version of the taxation aspects of President Carter's
economic stimulus program, H. R. 3477, the Tax Reduction and SimplifiCMA 037232
4
cation Act of 1977, There is uneasiness about the vote count, how­
ever, and the Senate leadership deferred floor consideration until
after Easter Recess,
The key question appears to be the $50 tax
rebate but an additional complication is the apparent back-lash
among Democratic members who resent Mr. Carter's recent cuts in
state water projects.
Insofar as industry is concerned, the major differences between
House and Senate bills thus far are in the tax incentives area.
The House version provides only for a new jobs credit of $1,680
for each new employee, with a ceiling of $40,000 credit for each
company. The Senate version gives companies an option to take a
new jobs credit somewhat similar to the one in the House bill, or
to choose the investment tax credit, increased from 10% to 12%.
The option was contained in the original Administration proposal.
A major floor fight is, of course, expected on the $50 tax
rebate, but another key question will be Senator Javits’ expected
amendment to substitute a permanent reduction in personal income
taxes for the rebate. This approach should receive solid support
from the 33 Senate Republicans, but it is doubtful that enough
Democrats will join in. Mr. Carter has hinted a veto of any bill '
containing a tax reduction because the Administration considers
that a central part of its reform package expected this Fall.
Conservative Democrats may sponsor an amendment to delete the
rebate without substituting any permanent tax reduction.
Another floor amendment fight could arise over a bill intro­
duced by Senator Frank Church, S. 1013, which would terminate
the deferral of taxation of foreign source income. There is a
good possiblity that he may propose the substance of this bill
as an amendment to the Tax Reduction and Simplification Act during
floor consideration.
If Senator Church does Introduce his "deferral" amendment,
there is a real danger that it may carry.
Last year, a similar
amendment was defeated by the margin of a single vote.
Since
the House defeated the common situs picketing bill, many Senators,
as well as Representatives, are anxious for an opportunity to
cast a "pro-labor" vote. Labor is on record opposing the
deferral concept, contending it encourages the export of jobs,
and so the Church amendment might furnish Senators an opportunity
to mend their labor fences.
We have alerted the members of our Government Relations and
Tax Policy Committees, asking that they urge Senators with whom
they have a constituent relationship to vote against such an
amendment.
CMA 037233

STATUS OF THE ARAB BOYCOTT SITUATION
There are two important areas of activity with respect to
the Arab Boycott situation, the first being in existing tax law.
Under the Tax Reform Act of 1976, the so-called Ribicoff amendment
denied various tax benefits to companies participating in or
cooperating with an international boycott.
The Treasury Depart­
ment has subsequently issued two sets of guidelines relating to
the boycott provisions of the \ct.
Our Tax Policy Committee has studied these guidelines and is
of the opinion that both the boycott provisions of the Tax Reform
Act and the guidelines themselves need further clarification.
We have, therefore, arranged for a meeting April 14 with Treasury
officials to discuss the problem. On April 29, IRS is holding
a public hearing on the guidelines. We expect either to request
to testify or to submit a statement at that hearing, and will
determine which approach to take after our meeting with Treasury.
The second area in which the Arab Boycott question is being
discussed is in pending amendments to the Export Administration
Act. The House International Relations Committee and the Senate
Banking Committee have both reported bills amending the Export
Administration Act to prohibit U. S. companies from participating
in foreign boycotts.
The Senate Banking Committee ordered S. 69 reported on
April 5 and expects to bring it to the floor soon after the
Easter Recess.
The House International Relations Committee reported a
clean bill, H.R. 5840, on April 6, and will request a rule on
April 19. House floor consideration is expected soon thereafter.
Though similar, the anti-boycott provisions of the House and
Senate bills have some differences:
The Senate-bill would provide an exception for U. S. firms
operating in boycotting countries, allowing them to comply with
local law with respect to activities exclusively within those
countries. The House bill contains no such provision.
The House bill will allow U. S. persons to comply with a
boycotter's designation of a U. S. transaction provided that this
exception would not apply in cases where the U. S. firm "has
actual knowledge that the sole purpose of the designation is to
implement the boycott". The Senate provision on unilateral
selection contains no such limitation.
CMA 037234
6
THE CARTER GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION PLAN
On April 6, President Carter signed into public law a major
Government reorganization bill, thus moving toward fullfillment
of a principal campaign promise:
reorganization of the sprawling
and overlapping Federal bureaucracy.
Every President since Hoover has had reorganization authority,
but the law was allowed to expire on April 1, 1973, because of
the Watergate controversy and Congressional displeasure over what
it considered usurpation of power by the Executive branch.
During hearings in the House Government Operations Committee,
Chairman Jack Brooks (D-TX) was adamantly opposed to giving the
President this power without a tight Congressional leash. He
wanted a bill which would require Congressional approval of any
proposed reorganization plan.
Brooks claimed the legislative
veto approach was unconstitutional.
(The President has veto
power. Congress the power to override.)
President Carter, however,
succeeded in convincing Government Operations Committee members
of the need for reorganization powers much the same as those held
by preceding Presidents.
Brooks was forced to relent and the
House eventually passed the bill on March 29 by a vote of 395-22.
The Senate had no problem with the reorganization issue and
passed its bill March 3 by a vote of 94-0.
Differences were quickly resolved in the joint conference,
and the following provisions became law:
* Presidential authority to submit government reorganization
plans for three years from enactment date;
* plans to be effective automatically unless either house
vetoes within 60 days following submission;
* Senate Governmental Affairs and the House Government

CHEMICAL FORUM MAY 10 FEATURES SENATE WHIP
The Senior U. S. Senator from Alaska, The Honorable Ted
Stevens, will be speaker and guest of honor at the next edition
of MCA's CHEMICAL FORUM, Tuesday, May 10. The luncheon program
will be held in the Lincoln Ballroom of the Washington Hilton
Hotel, Washington, D. C.
Senator Stevens is the Republican Whip of the Senate, the
second-ranking party leadership post behind Minority Leader
Howard Baker of Tennessee. He serves on three important Senate
Committees: Appropriations; Governmental Affairs; and Commerce,
Science and Transportation. He is also one of the 12 members of
the Technology Assessment Board, the Congressional body that
oversees the activities of the Office of Technology Assessment.
Prior to coming to the Senate in 1968, Ted Stevens had a
distinguished law career in Alaska and became U. S. Attorney
there. He later worked in Washington, D. C., as a top aide to the
Secretary of Interior when Alaskan statehood was being sought.
He is a 1950 graduate of Harvard Law School.

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
WILLIAM R. CHALKER, CHAIRMAN
AIR QUALITY COMMITTEE
APRIL 12, 1977
It is a privilege to appear before you.
In discussing the
activities of the Air Quality Committee, I will highlight a key
problem with the Clean Air Act and amendatory efforts; point out
flaws in the EPA interpretive ruling on offset of hydrocarbons
in nonattainment areas? cite our involvement in the EPA synthetic
organic chemical industry study; touch on our MCA hydrocarbon
control cost study and oxidant episode study; and, describe several
new areas of coming concern.
The regulatory tempo in the air pollution field keeps rising,
but our objective remains the same — to get permits to con­
struct plants or modify existing ones expeditiously and within
realistic environmental constraints,
in going down the permit trail,
The
we face an ever-widening array of regulations and concepts.
decisions of control agencies are transcending their past areas
of concern and are influencing such widely different facets as
land use, life style, industrial production techniques, and
return on investment,
it is amazing that we have coped as w 11
as we have with this complex situation.
Oxidant Air Quality Standard and Control Strategy
The oxidant or ozone air quality standard is the focal point
of much of our current dilemma.
There are those who say there
is too much ozone near the ground, and there are those who say
there is not enough in the stratosphere. All we have to do is
restructure the atmosphere — our problems are just about that
complex and the outcome just about that unclear.
You received
a briefing on the Houston Area Oxidant Study from Mr. Files and
others at your Board meeting last month.
Our Committee thinks
it is an important study and one that EPA will not be able to
ignore.
I believe it will be useful to emphasize several as­
pects of the oxidant problem.
CMA 037238
EPA' s oxidant standard is being exceeded in every state
that has taken measurements.
It is not a Texas problem alone.
Few believe in the standard, including Dr. Knelson, Director
of EPA1s Health Effects Research Laboratory.
The API petition
to EPA, which MCA supports, questions the standard and the con­
trol strategy to attain the standard.
Best evidence indicates
the standard will not be changed significantly.
However, EPA
strategy to attain the standard is being tightened and will
require offsets for new sources.
For example, new hydrocarbon
emissions located in areas where the oxidant standard is not
being met must somehow accomplish reductions in existing emis­
sions to more than offset the added emissions.
This problem
and EPA's proposed offset solution are the result of Clean Air
Act language.
Mr. Polzer's recent testimony on behalf of MCA
before the Senate and House strongly emphasized the need for
relief if orderly development in the nation is to continue.
Actually, we are on strong technical ground in saying that
oxidant is relatively insensitive to changes in hydrocarbons
and that hydrocarbons cannot be controlled sufficiently in
most places to attain the oxidant standard.
Los Angeles is a
prime example.
In 25 years, that county has reduced hydro­
carbons from stationary source emissions by 88% and from vehicles
Last year, they exceeded the oxidant standard on over 100
days.
EPA knows we cannot attain the standard in many places,
but their new strategy is to make progress towards it by attempt­
ing to reduce high oxidant concentrations in large metropolitan
areas and hence reduce the numbers of people at risk.
This
philosophy agrees with MCA's recent Congressional testimony
urging Congress to modify the zero risk concept currently in­
herent in the Act.
There is technical evidence that we can
make progress but at enormous cost to control stationary sources
and by imposition of drastic curtailment of vehicles by an
unwilling public.
There are potential environmental hazards,
however, to EPA emphasis on hydrocarbon controls.
The de­
emphasis on controlling oxides of nitrogen, a partner in photo­
chemical reactions, can cause the "smog" problem to spread further
into rural areas and lead to a buildup of oxides of nitrogen and
pose yet another potential health risk.
This is precisely what
is happening in the areas contiguous to Los Angeles. MCA has
conveyed to EPA our Committee's belief that hydrocarbon offset
is unworkable.
CMA 037239
While some adjustments in offset requirements now appear
likely, EPA is not abandoning its broader thesis and has no­
tified 29 states to revise their hydrocarbon control regulations
by mid-1978. We face public hearings in all these states.
Pres­
ently, it is unclear if or how the Association should handle
these individual states.
I certainly recommend we gear up to
handle regional problems such as the 12 northeastern states cur­
rently banding together to write uniform hydrocarbon standards.
Clean Air Act Amendments
While I have mentioned problems with nonattainment of the
oxidant standard and offsets, we have concerns with other as­
pects of the Clean Air Act.
MCA has been most active in testi­
fying, writing, and visiting Congressmen and in meeting with
their staffs to seek all the amendments proposed in Mr. Polzer's
testimony. At the moment, the situation is too fluid to say
more than we are cautiously optimistic that some of our concerns
are being heard and dealt with.
Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry Study
Another area of concern to us is the EPA study of the
synthetic organic chemical industry.- Their purpose is to
develop federal new source performance standards and guide­
line documents for states to use in developing retrofit regu­
lations for existing sources.
This is a two to three year
effort.
EPA's reasons for this study are that organics form
photochemical oxidants and organics are toxic with some being
carcinogenic.
EPA states that synthetic organic chemicals contribute
10% of the total hydrocarbon emissions from stationary sources.
They state that control hinges primarily on proper plant design
and operation that will require a depth of knowledge by EPA of
our operations that is unprecedented,
we have set up a task
group to handle this and to coordinate with SOCMA. A total of
about 40 chemicals will be studied. A first meeting of our
task group with EPA was held on January 21. Almost immediately,
the orderly procession of this program was upset to handle
benzene on an emergency basis because of strong criticism
against EPA by the Environmental Defense Fund that benzene was
CMA 037240
a significant health hazard and a carcinogen. A special MCA
task group to handle this item alone met with EPA on February 15.
Since this is a single product, response to EPA is being made on
an individual company basis.
Eleven MCA member companies are
participating.
EPA wants emission data, ambient air data, and
views on control techniques, etc. Attached to this presentation
is a tentative list of the next nine chemicals and processes to
be considered. We are setting up task groups to handle them.
MCA Hydrocarbon Control Cost Study - By Foster D. Snell, Inc.
Your companies have been in receipt of the Foster D. Snell, Inc.
hydrocarbon control cost questionnaire for about three weeks. Al­
though it may not have reached your ears, I am sure your people
are fuming over it because it is comprehensive.
We have never at­
tempted anything to this depth before, but then, we've never faced
$5-$15 billion in investment cost for control of a single class of
pollution before.
I use these cost figures with some confidence
because my own company last year in a similar type study estimated
an investment cost of $350 million to retrofit existing hydro­
carbon sources if the toughest projected pollution control regu­
lations were adopted.
In many cases, this study is going to be
an eye opener and hopefully haYe valuable spin-off information
for use in your individual companies. . It will show we discharge
a greater tonnage of hydrocarbons than we thought; that we do not
have a good estimate on emissions from a number of sources; that
likely the majority of our total poundage emissions derive from
only a fraction of our total sources.
The results can force
another look at raw material losses and perhaps spotlight more
candidates for waste heat recovery.
Further, there is a new EPA
directive that all states prepare a hydrocarbon emission inventory
by mid-year.
Finally, management will be better able to judge
the cost impact of proposed new hydrocarbon regulations. Lack of
emission data last year posed a serious problem to the New Jersey
Industrial Advisory Committee in evaluating, at the request of
the state, the financial impact of the Moodus Conference model
hydrocarbon regulation.
MCA - Oxidant Episode Study - By Radian Corporation
The study of ambient air oxidant during high and low con­
centration periods and its relationship to the concentration of
its principal precursors, oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons.
CMA 037241
and their relationship, in turn, to hydrocarbon emissions in
ten metropolitan areas is proceeding on schedule.
Results are
expected this summer.
Atmospheric Dispersion Modeling
Proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act call for the use
of atmospheric dispersion modeling for use in evaluating sig­
nificant deterioration, nonattainment, etc. Argonne National
Laboratory held a Specialist Conference for EPA in February to
develop consensus models to be issued to the states as a further
tool to evaluate permits.
Our Committee had representation and
when the effort becomes more crystallized, we will consider
holding a workshop.
New Areas of Concern
EPA is revising the six existing air quality standards and
will be adding new ones.
Our Committee will need medical and
epidemiological input if we are to react.
Part of our problem
today, e.g., on oxidants, may be that our Association and others
were not in a position to comment vigorously when the several
standards were set six years ago.
Unless you object, it is my
intention to seek a nucleus of medical representation from your
companies to determine the feasibility of a rebuttal. A second
item needing medical input is advice on the concentrations in
the community environment that are considered safe for all our
chemicals.
The current procedure is to use the OSHA standards
and arbitrarily take a percentage of them and call this safe for
the public.
We will have to do better than this for benzene,
acrylonitrile and eventually all the rest. We would plan to us
your aforementioned medical representatives to guide our Com­
mittee in this crucial area also. A third item is that relatively
little attention has been paid by control agencies to our emissions
during start-up and shutdowns, emergency releases, and fugitive
losses.
Various estimates indicate they may be as large as our
normal emissions and control agencies are starting to note this.
We anticipate greater regulatory attention to these types of emissions.
Some questions of this type appear in our hydrocarbon cost study.
CMA 037242
Conclusions
In conclusion, I understand the Board approved adding a
General Counsel to the MCA Staff. Despite the strength of
present staff support, we welcome this and, being pushy, hope
the time will come when an environmental lawyer is also hired.
Lastly, the system wouldn't work without the major contributions
of our Committee members.
I appreciate your making this pos­
sible.
Even so, we sometimes feel like a platoon fighting an
army.
Thank you.

OPENING REMARKS AND INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS
With a special welcome to past directors and other guests. Chairman
Donley opened the meeting by calling for self-introduction of those present in
turn.
MINUTES OF SEPTEMBER 12, 1978, MEETING
Minutes of the September 12, 1978, Board meeting, as distributed,
including the financial statement for three months ending August 31, 1978,
were approved.
FINANCIAL REPORT
A summarized financial statement for five months ending October 31,
1978, Exhibit A, was reviewed by Mr. Herrman. Noting that assets totaled
approximately $8. 6 million, of which $4. 4 million related to special proj­
ects, he emphasized that with budget amendments this year, we currently
have budgeted revenues of $4, 525, 000 and total budget expenses of $5, 362, 000.
Assuming no further budget changes, we are looking forward to a budget
deficit of $837,900 at the end of this fiscal year. The monthly Treasurer's
report for the period June 1, 1978 - October 31, 1978 will be mailed with the
Board minutes.
FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
As chairman, Mr. Burrell reviewed the activities of the Finance Com­
mittee in addressing the impact on expenses resulting from the reorganization
of MCA. To date, this would create the expected deficit of $837,900 mention­
ed by Mr. Herrman as a result of additional funding approved by the Executive
Committee. This could increase to a deficit of $1,263, 000 if contemplated
additional requests from MCA standing committees were approved. Two
CMA 037604
2060
alternatives for financing the deficit were presented to the Executive Com­
mittee -- funding from reserves or levying a special assessment. In the
former approach, a deficit of $1 million would reduce reserves to 25% of
the operating budget, while reserves would drop to 19% with a deficit of
$1. 3 million as against the general criteria the Association has followed of
a reserve of about 50%. With the special assessment approach, at a
reserve level of 50% a deficit of $1 million would require a special assessment
of 33% of current dues for each member and a deficit of $1.3 million would re­
quire a special assessment of 43%.
The Finance Committee unanimously recommended to the Executive
Committee that the fiscal year 1978-79 deficit should be funded by utilization
of MCA's reserves with the criteria that the operating reserves could not fall
below the 25% level. This was approved by the Executive Committee.
Mr. Donley then reviewed the reorganization of MCA, its enhanced
advocacy role, and the increased commitments of member companies in
providing strong people to the new committees, in order to enable the
Association to respond effectively to the increased pressures of governmental action. He solicited response from the Board and all member com­
panies to the increased communications which will emanate from MCA so
that the Associations activities can best reflect the interests of the industry.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE BYLAWS
Mr. Barackman advised that proposed Bylaws amendments enclosed
with the notice of meeting would effect the necessary changes resulting
from splitting the functions of the Secretary-Treasurer approved by the
Executive Committee.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded,
it was
VOTED: That the proposed amendments
to the Bylaws, as set fourth in Exhibit B,
be approved.
REPORT OF CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
Mr. Donley's report is attached as Exhibit C.
ASSOCIATION ACTIVITIES
Mr. Roland's report follows: The Chairman's report is the first of
a series of quarterly reports which will be published to the entire MCA
membership.
CMA 037605
2061
--In the public relations area we had 12 company experts at
the National Association of Farm Broadcasters convention in Kansas
City on hand to discuss 23 topics. 46 broadcasters taped 146 radio
shows to be aired over nearly 1,600 radio stations covering about 75%
of the United States. The program's cost of reaching one person varies
with audience size and ranges from less than one and a half cents to a
thousandth of a cent.
-- In a visit with Alfred Kahn, Chairman of the Council on Wage
and Price Stability (COWPS), he said he was against wage/price controls
and would work for more effective and economical government in the
framework of regulatory reform. Because he indicated a willingness to
do so, a meeting with Mr. Kahn, together with Mr. Barry Bosworth,
director of COWPS, has been requested at which time the chemical in­
dustry problems, as embodied in the economic and regulatory profile
developed for the recent meeting with Commerce Secretary Kreps, would
be discussed - especially in light of the fact that the selection of 1976-77
as base years for profits and prices was unfortunate for many companies.
Meanwhile Mr. Kahn asks for industry support of the announced wage/price
guidelines.
-- Another area of concern is chemical industry coordination with
other associations. To effect this, the new position of Director of
Association Liaison is being established within MCA. This move has been
applauded by some 20 associations with whom it has been discussed. The
Director will be responsible for communicating information regarding
MCA's positions, activities and needs to other relevant industry trade
associations and groups while providing MCA with similar information from
them.
-- The words "Manufacturing Chemists Association" don't accurately
reflect the membership of the industry association for today's man in the
street. The name "Chemical Manufacturers Association" (CMA) conveys
the idea that the association is made up of corporations, rather than persons,
who make the commodity chemicals. The Executive Committee supports
this name change. The matter will be placed on the agenda for the January
Board meeting. The Executive Committee recommends that if approved by
the Board, the entire membership then be polled for their reaction.
-- Mr. Roland concluded his report with a description of the program
planned for the day following the Board meeting.
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS REPORT
Mr. Stover's report, distributed at the meeting,- is attached as Exhibit
D. During his report he reviewed in detail the meeting with Commerce
Secretary Kreps and chemical industry spokesmen and also called attention
to the importance of the question of oil price regulation. Regarding the latter,
CMA 037606
MCA has testified on the pricing issue on numerous occasions, in support
of any actions which permit petroleum prices to rise to world levels
through decontrol or phased removal of price controls. This would en­
able primary energy prices to reflect replacement costs and provide the
maximum incentive to develop new resources and expand the supply base.
At the conclusion of Mr. Stover's report, Mr. Foveaux discussed
the Administration?s anti-inflation program headed by Alfred Kahn, chair­
man of COWPS. He also described the establishment of an MCA task
group charged with monitoring developments in the wage/price area;
guiding companies to sources of information; proposing MCA responses
as appropriate and recommending them for approval at the proper level;
and coordinating communications as they are needed.
REPORT BY GENERAL COUNSEL
Mr. Frost's report is attached as Exhibit E.
BUSINESS ITEM
Report of Membership Committee
As chairman, Mr. Polzer
reported the committee's having examined the qualifications of the company
named below and recommended its election.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded,
it was
VOTED: That Hatco Chemical Corporation
be elected to membership in the Association.
NEW BUSINESS
Mr. Donley advised that the Chairman's quarterly report to the Board
of Directors would be distributed to all member companies.
Mr. Morley expressed concern about proposals developing in the MCA
Occupational Safety and Health Committee for the identification of chronic
hazards on sample labels appearing in MCA safety data sheets. Since safety
data sheet labels could be considered in some quarters as an industry
standard, he felt that there was a serious risk that even minor defects
could lead to costly but unnecessary testing for every product marketed by
a company. He wanted to be sure that proposed chronic hazard labeling
guidelines received appropriate review by all of those member companies
pvith representatives serving on the committees and task groups with respon­
sibilities related to labeling. He was assured by Mr. Roland that the report
of the Occupational Safety and Health Committee, whichhas the responsibility
in this area, will be given the widest possible consideration, including review
by other relevant committees, and that all the input necessary for a good
2063
work product will be considered by that committee and by the staff.
vited comments from anyone having a concern in this matter.
Mr. Henske expressed the view that in two years, if we continue on
our present course, MCA's budget will be about double the current fiscal
year's budget. MCA has become more active, which costa money. If there
are any reservations or questions about where the Association is headed,
they should be communicated between now and spring at which time decisions
concerning next year's budget will be made. We are headed for a material
increase in the costs of running MCA. Comments, advice and guidance of the
member companies are welcomed.
Mr. Donley announced that copies of the Finance Committee report
and minutes will be distributed to all Board members.

CHAIRMAN'S REPORT
August, September, October 1978
Introduction
The close of the 95th congress in October brought a mass of
legislation which we are still studying for its relevance to
the chemical industry.
The National Energy Program, of course,
is the most important of these last-minute bills because of
the wide-ranging and continuing impact it will have.
But
amid the closing rush were other signal successes for MCA
and the industry.
They were treated extensively in a special
Federal Legislative Bulletin and a special insert to MCA
News, but their names bear repeating here:
Section 311,
"superfund," TSCA amendments, energy reporting.
The successes were the result of close cooperation among
all staff members.
It is this kind of cooperation, this
kind of activity that will mark the spirit of the new ad­
vocacy role MCA has begun to play.
The agenda for the next quarter is full.
The Resource con­
servation and Recovery Act, certain aspects of the Toxic
Substances Control Act, pretreatment regulations, preven­
tion of significant deterioration regulations, state implem­
entation plans on air pollution, product liability legislation.
And more.
Never, it seems, has there been so much to do, and
never has the Association been in better condition to do it.
The reorganization is working, and the more tightly structured
committees and staff are responding with renewed spirit to the
tasks facing them.

TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT
CHEMICAL REGULATIONS ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
MCA has made every effort
to make clear to EPA that overly strict rules under section 5
(Premanufacturing and processing Notices) can obstruct innovation
if demands for health, safety and marketing information go beyond
the statutory need to establish that there is no unreasonable risk.
Economic Impacts Task Group.
A one-year, $300,000 pilot study on
the economic impact of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
was begun with the signing of an agreement with National Economic
Research Associates, Inc.
The primary objectives are to establish
a method for measuring the economic impact of TSCA on the chemical
industry and the U.S. economy, to impact EPA during the regulatory
development process and to impact Congress for regulatory reform.
Over the next few months, the actual survey questionnaire will be
developed and pretested on a small group of member companies.
DISTRIBUTION COMMITTEE.
MCA is asking appropriate member companies
if they accept the railroad's proposal for a new tank car mileage
allowance system that would increase compensation by almost twothirds in three years. Approval by MCA member companies and
other parties to the proceeding seems certain.
MCA will file a
statement noting that a proposal to change truck drivers' hours of
service might actually increase accidents.
The proposal of the
Transportation Department's Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety will
increase costs by 25 percent.
In an Interstate commerce Commission
proceeding on increased freight rates and charges, MCA has filed
a statement contending that the rail rates on six chemical product
groups were already too high.
MCA plans to file a similar state­
ment on future railroad freight rate increase proposals that would
raise chemical freight rates.
ENERGY CONSERVATION COMMITTEE.
The latest energy conservation
report (for the period June 1977 to June 1978) to the Department
of Energy was presented to the press at a luncheon on November
6, with Robert A. Roland as host.
Also distributed to the press
were MCA replies to the General Accounting Offices' reporting
program and the Energy Information Administration's report to
Congress that could give Congress the impression that a more
legislation and regulation are needed to accomplish what already
is being accomplished.
The committee is working on tentative
industry positions on the National Energy Act and has discussed
coal conversion regulations with the DOE's economic regulatory
CMA 037615
-2administrator.
On December 7, the committee will conduct a seminar
for DOE on cost determination in the chemical industry.
ENGINEERING ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
The Engineering Advisory Committee
(EAC) National Electrical Code Task Group met in August to
recommend MCA proposals for revision of the National Electrical
Code.
The EAC's Task Group on Electrical Motors met in August
to finish a proposed MCA guide entitled "Recommended Specifi­
cation Guide for NEMA-Frame Size Totally-Enclosed Fan-Cooled
Horizontal Induction Motors for chemical Industry Service".
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE.
During August through October,
the Environmental Management Committee and its task groups met
more than 30 times on its present major programs:
solid waste
regulations, hazardous chemical spills, pretreatment regulations,
prevention of significant deterioration regulations, content of
pending revisions to state implementation plans, health effects
of air quality, water quality criteria, toxic pollutant sampling
and new economic perspectives on environmental regulations.
The committee also developed a program for combined technical and
legal actions to prepare the bases for responding to 25 critical
regulations, among 87 identified of importance, scheduled to be
issued by the end of 1979.
In structuring this program, the EMC
established 15 task groups, compared to 47 under the "old" committee
structure, and reduced task group members to about 80 from more
than 250.
INSURANCE COMMITTEE.
On September 28, Robert L. Mitchell of
Celanese Corporation presented a statement before the Sub­
committee on Miscellaneous Revenue Measures of the House Ways
and Means Committee supporting the tax deductibility of reserves
to pay product liability claims.
Congress failed to act on
legislation for reserve deductibility but instead enacted tax
"carry-back" provisions which will do little to alleviate pro­
duct liability claim problems,
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH COMMITTEE.
In a statement for
MCA before the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on
Human Resources on October 5, Dr. Bruce W. Karrh, medical director
of the DuPont Company, called on OSHA to work cooperatively with
industry rather than taking punitive action to secure an injuryfree workplace.
CMA037616
In a post-hearing brief submitted to OSHA, MCA said the agency
exceeded its statutory authority in issuing its much debated
carcinogen regulation proposal.
Also reviewed were the need for
risk/benefit analysis and points in support of the American
industrial Health Council position.
A Task Group on Chronic Hazard Labeling is drafting recommended
guidelines for use in preparing exemplary labels in MCA chemical
safety data sheets.
At its meeting September 13, the occupational Safety and Health
Committee recommended that MCA challenge the "access to records"
portion of the final (interim) regulation promulgated by OSHA
regarding exposure and medical records.
Guidelines are being
developed by a task group on this subject for the collection of
health and industrial hygiene information to be used in epidemi­
ologic studies.
The use of such guidelines by member companies
would help assure compatibility of the data when such studies are
undertaken.
Guidelines also are being developed on the "evaluation, classifi­
cation, risk assessment and control of chemical teratogens," as
well as "control of embryotoxic agents in the workplace," by still
another task group of the committee.
SPECIAL PROJECTS.
Fluorocarbons.
Significant progress has been
made in the fluorocarbon research program administered by MCA
towards its goal of determining the effects of these materials
upon the atmosphere.
Sufficient data and knowledge of the
chemistry involved from studies completed to date have made it
possible to begin development of a multidimensional computer
model of the role of fluorocarbons in the atmosphere.
At its September 28 meeting, the Technical Panel on Fluorocarbon
Research approved proposals for the continued operation of the
Atmospheric Lifetimes Experiment.
This project is designed to
determine the residence time of fluorocarbons in the troposphere,
and, in combination with the computer modeling activity, will
yield valuable information about the lifetimes of fluorocarbons
in the atmosphere.
Four stations analyze ambient air continu­
ously for species of interest.
The fluorocarbon research program
provided $420,000 to establish these stations and to begin
operations in early 1978.
The program provided an additional
CMA 037617
$335,000 on September 28 to operate the stations and to analyze
data for the second year of the experiment.
Other ongoing studies of particular importance are the development of a method of analysis for total chlorine in the stratosphere and catalytic destruction of fluorocarbons in the
troposphere by air-borne dust and sand particles.
Proposals
for trend analysis of ozone concentration, joining the rela­
tively new satellite observations with an extensive set of
ground-based data, are presently under consideration in the
panel.
Phosgene.
The Technical Panel on Phosgene Safety met on Octo­
ber 31 to complete action on 14 agenda items. Among the more
important of these were six investigative proposals.
Five of
these are concerned with retrospective mortality studies, retrospective pulmonary studies and a prospective on-site study in a
member company wherein the phosgene unit is relatively isolated
from other suspect exposures.
The sixth project under considera­
tion is a long-term, low-level inhalation study.
j

I
Titanium Dioxide.
The Tabershaw Occupational Medicine Associates
P.A., have in progress a feasibility analysis for an epidemiolog­
ical study of titanium dioxide workers.
On-site visits have
recently been completed.
A draft of the final report is to be
submitted in November.
Depending on the findings evolving from
the feasibility study, a full-scale epidemiological investigation
might be conducted.
Trichloroethylene.
The Trichloroethylene Task Group on the Audit
of the Chronic Inhalation Study met in November to prepare a final
report on this research program, which was conducted by industrial
BIO-TEST Laboratories, Decatur, 111.
Two important actions must
be completed by the audit task group prior to its final report:
A comprehensive review of and critique on the air concentration
report or the exposure chamber concentration report.
Review of
a critique on a draft of the final report covering a histopath­
ologic study conducted by Experimental pathology Laboratories,
Inc.
CMA 037618
Eoichlorohydrin.
The Technical panel on Epichlorohydrin will meet
on November 21 to review the findings of the 90-day inhalation
probe.
Also attending will be Dr. A. R. Sellakumar, who will
discuss his research at the New York University Medical center.
On October 12 a Current Intelligence Bulletin was issued advising
that epichlorohydrin should be treated in the workplace as if
it were a human carcinogen.
Ethylene Dichloride.
Research on the effects of long-term inhala­
tion is not yet complete, although preliminary results do not show
any excess carcinogenicity.
The National Cancer Institute
recently issued its report on the carcinogenesis bioassay of
ethylene dichloride, stating that oral administration of the com­
pound produced cancers in rats and mice.
Vinylidene Chloride.
On September 21, a joint NIOSH/OSHA Current
Int lligence Bulletin was issued on the carcinogenicity of vinyl
halides — including vinylidene chloride.
Citing the NIOSH
Criteria Document and Dr. C. Maltoni's work, the bulletin says
vinylidene chloride caused angiosarcoma of the liver in
animals.
The bulletin is currently being reviewed by the technical
panel, especially in light of the extensive research program MCA
has administered.
Benzene,
in mid-summer 1978, MCA entered into a contract with
Tabershaw Occupational Medicine Associates for a mortality study
of workers exposed to benzene at nine operating plants of member
companies.
This epidemiological work is expected to be completed
about the Spring of 1980.
Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT). Additional funds have been approved
for an expert's review of the Franklin institute's report on a
literature survey.
TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS,
procedures to establish and maintain
other technical publications in addition to Chemical Safety Data
Sheets
in an up-to-date condition were recommended by outside
counsel in September.
Steps to implement the recommendations
are being taken.
The MCA film, "Safety in the Chemical Laboratory"
was found to be out-of-date, has been withdrawn from distribution
and purchasers of the film advised.
Drafts of 11 revised chemical
Safety Data Sheets are being prepared; eight drafts are now in the
edit/review stage; two drafts are in final form, awaiting resolu­
CMA 037619
tion of chronic hazard question before publication, and one drafton phosgene—has been published.
Revised drafts of eight Safety Guides are in various states of
completion, four are in final draft and one has been published.
CHEMTREC.
One CHEMTREC workshop was held in Cleveland in October.
One is scheduled for Atlanta in November.
The manager of CHEMTREC
made the following presentations: Detroit — 1978 Mid-continent
Conference & Exhibition on Control of Chemical & oil Spills;
Cincinnati — International Association of Fire Chiefs; Maryland University of Maryland - Fire & Rescue Services; Delaware —
Chemical Industry Council and New Castle County Fire Chiefs
Association.

GOVERNMENT RELATIONS DEPARTMENT
LEGISLATIVE COMMUNICATIONS:
Energy.
in connection with the
National Energy Plan legislation proposed by the administration,
MCA worked in close concert with Washington representatives of
member companies and members of the Energy Conservation Committee.
Congressional developments were monitored closely to insure that
enacted bills were compatible with industry interests,
particular
attention was given to energy tax proposals which might have
produced user taxes or a crude oil equalization tax.
Environment.
Superfund.
MCA took the leading role in an int rindustry effort to block enactment of this highly objectionable
piece of legislation. We were joined by petroleum, waterways,
trucking, railroad and other interests.
CMA 037620
Section 311.
MCA was the principal industry organization responsible
for enactment of a vastly improved Section 311 of the Clean Water
Act.
The section now clearly distinguishes between discharges
associated with routine operations and spills from non-routine
causes.
The Association, working closely with EPA and several
other industry groups and Congressional staff, was able to help
to steer the industry bill through both senate and House in the
final hours of the 95th Congress.
The Government Relations Department has begun evaluation of
1 gislative prospects for the coming year in the environmental
area, with particular attention to the likelihood of amendments
to RCRA.
OSHA.
MCA testified before the Senate Labor Subcommittee during
its oversight hearings on OSHA in early October.
Our staff
participated in polishing of Association testimony, gathered
useful background material on Subcommittee members, helped to
srief and prepare the witness team and handled all logistical
rommunications before and after the hearings.
i
MCA monitored and reported in detail on the OSHA oversight hear­
ings conducted by the House Manpower Subcommittee in mid-September.
AIHC.
In support of AIHC programs, the staff participated in a
number of meetings with Washington representatives and with
communications specialists handling the AIHC media campaign.
A
number of advisory communications have been sent to all member
companies keeping them abreast of developments.
Special attention
is being given to constructive contacts with members of Congress
to explain the AIHC alternatives package.
Taxation.
In connection with MCA testimony in late August on the
tax reduction bill, the staff worked closely with the Association
witness in preparing him for his appearance before the Senate
Finance Committee.
We coordinated development and submission of
an Association statement on the "sunset" review of taxation issues
which was filed September 1. A letter to the House Ways and Means
Committee was prepared in early September which expresses our views
on the tax treatment of employee fringe benefits.
On the 31st of
October there was a general meeting of the MCA Tax Policy Committee.
CMA 037621
Toxic Substances Control Act.
The staff lead industry efforts to
communicate with Congress regarding the impending amendments to
TSCA, a version of which passed the Senate containing an objectionable indemnification provision.
The measure died in the House of
Representatives.
1
Transportation.
MCA continues to monitor closely the increased
Congressional interest and attention to emergency response capa­
bilities in connection with transportation accidents.
We worked
closely with Congressional staff and participated in the MCA
Emergency Response Workshop conducted in Cleveland in October.
We monitored Congressional attention to the Norfolk and Western
rail strike, which was causing concern for many chemical shippers.
1
Trade/Tariffs.
The staff answered numerous requests from member
companies and media regarding the multilateral trade negotiations.
A staff member represented MCA as a consultant to the U. S.
Government's delegation to the annual meeting of the Economic
Commission of Europe, Chemical industry committee.
In connection
with the visit by leaders from the European Council of Chemical
Industry Federations, we prepared an economic analysis and fore­
cast paper for their advance review.
In addition, the staff
chaired the staff-level briefing conducted for the delegation
during their visit October 10.
The staff participated in numerous
meetings with government officials on trade matters including
representatives of GAO, the Office of the Special Representative
for Trade Negotiations, the Department of Commerce and Congressional
staff.
Product Liability.
The MCA staff helped prepare a letter to a
Senate Finance Subcommittee setting forth the Association's views
on legislation to provide tax deductions for amounts held in
reserve for product liability losses.
The letter was submitted
in early September.
Later that month we were also involved in
preparing testimony in the same area which was presented to the
House Ways and Means Subcommittee,
J
CMA 037622
PROJECTS AND SERVICES:
Chemical Forum.
The Chemical Forum lunch­
eon series is planned and managed by the staff of the Government
Relations Department.
The September 12 luncheon featured an ad­
dress by Representative James G. Martin (R-NC), a member of the
House ways and Means Committee and a well-known spokesman for
reasonableness on questions of science and government regulation.
On October 10 the forum was addressed by Under Secretary of
Commerce Sidney Harman.
Briefing Breakfasts.
The Briefing Breakfast series is conduc­
ted by the MCA staff as a means of providing regular up-dates
for Washington representatives of member companies.
Status
reports and current action in both legislative and regulatory
areas are presented.
Special guests frequently make brief
presentations and answer questions.
On August 31 the special
guest was Charles Bruce, a counsel on the staff of the Senate
Finance Committee, who discussed pending tax legislation.
On
October 26, William F. Hildenbrand, secretary to the minority
of the Senate and principal Senate floor aide to Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker, gave his forecast on the Senate races
in the November 7 elections.
I
Monitoring and Publications,
in addition to routine legislative
monitoring, the staff published editions of the Federal Legisla­
tive Bulletin on August 29 and October 19 that gave up-to-date
reports on legislation of interest to the chemical industry.
The October issue furnished a wrap-up of the 95th Congress.
Legislative status charts were also prepared on several oc­
casions for use at Briefing Breakfasts and for distribution to
the MCA Board of Directors and MCA Executive Committee.
INTERNAL MISCELLANEOUS:
During this quarter the Department added
two new staff members.
H. Christopher Nolde joined us as legis­
lative representative for safety and health.
He will manage the
legislative communications programs which relate to TSCA and OSHA
and will serve as legislative editor.
Miss Doris Baquine joins
the staff as secretary to Mr. Nolde.

CMA 037623
GENERAL COUNSEL
The first few months of activities under the MCA reorganiza­
tion have brought a significant increase in the scope of MCA's
legal advisory program.
The successful litigation in the
Western District of Louisiana against EPA's regulations under
Section 311 of the Clean Water Act was the first major case
brought by MCA.
More recently MCA joined the American Petro­
leum Institute and the American Iron and Steel Institute in
successfully challenging OSHA's benzene regulations in the
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
MCA also has asked for a
review of EPA's Pretreatment Regulations adopted under Sec­
tion 307 of the Clean Water Act and a review of EPA's Pre­
vention of Significant Deterioration regulations under the
Clean Air Act.
MCA's legal advocacy presently covers a broad range of ad­
ministrative and regulatory activity including OSHA's proposed
generic cancer regulation, OSHA’s proposed medical records
retention regulations. Consumer Product Safety Commission's
cancer regulation, EPA's TSCA regulations, EPA's Clean Water
Act permit regulations, and EPA's Resource and Recovery Act
regulations.
This broad scope of advocacy is not jis t legal
argument.
Rather, it integrates legal and technical advocacy,
with MCA counsel working closely with MCA committees and tech­
nical staff.
Not all of the advocacy is litigation.
In the
case of Section 311 regulations, successful litigation paved
the way for a more permanent settlement negotiated with EPA
and implemented by legislative amendment.
The Section 311
negotiation has, in turn, provided the opportunity for what
may be very meaningful, high-level negotiations concerning
RCRA and liabilities related to solid waste disposal.
PUBLIC RELATIONS AND EDUCATION
ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION.
In addition to continuing to pro­
vide news on environmental and occupational health matters.
CMA 037624
ChemEcology addressed three major issues of importance to the
industry during this quarter.
Transportation safety was the theme in the August issue.
in
September, ChemEcology was careful to provide facts about the
Lov canal incident which most of the media chose to ignore.
This helped to put that issue much more in its proper perspec­
tive.
Several articles in the October issue emphasized the
growing realization that risk/benefit is more than a concept—
it is a fact of life.
For example, the National Research Coun­
cil says that the benefits of nitrogen fertilizers outweigh
their possible risk to the ozone layer, and a federal court
struck down a workplace standard for benzene on the basis that
its cost exceeded potential benefits to employees.
During this period 400 additional thought and opinion leaders
voluntarily asked to be added to our mailing list, bringing
total ChemEcology circulation to 24,000.
Three Toxic Substances Management Memos were issued on Sec­
tions 5 and 8(d) of the Toxic Substances control Act, and on
the Association's economic impact study of the Act.
At the
same time, the circulation of the memos has been expanded
and opened to anyone in the industry with a "need to know."
Environmental information was made available during these
three months through MCA exhibits at meetings of the American
Chemical Society, the American public Health Association
and the National Science Teachers Association.
Education Activities.
An ititial printing of 50,000 copies
of "Minority Engineers—A Guide to Career Selection" has been
exhausted.
The booklet is MCA's contribution to the industry's
effort to achieve a parity in the hiring of minority engineers
within 10 years.
A completely new edition of "Chemistry Proj­
ects and Science Fairs" was also published.
Distribution of
"Experiments in the chemistry of Foods" was stopped because
it included suspect chemicals.
A public advisory has been
issued. ■ MCA exhibited for the first time at a meeting of the
CMA 037625
American Public Health Association, a group that includes
environmentalists, public health directors, government ad­
ministrators and educators.
October was also MCA's first
time to exhibit at an American chemical Society meeting.
At the National Science Teachers Association convention
in October, MCA strengthened its liaison and continued
its role of leadership within NSTA by serving on the conven­
tion planning committee.
Through MCA’s efforts, the
chief toxicologist of The Dow Chemical Company probably
will address the NSTA national meeting next April.
The
manager of education participated in several ACS con­
ferences and in a conference on high school chemical edu­
cation.
Preparations for the next teacher awards have
begun.
Consumer Information.
MCA has arranged for the first time
to participate in the National Association of Farm Broad­
casters annual meeting in November.
Before this meeting
began, MCA had received more than 60 requests from indiv­
iduals for two to four interviews each with industry repre­
sentatives for a total of 100-250 tapes.
Since this is a
first-time effort, only audio tapes will be made. About
3,000 tapes of interviews made at the American Women in Ra­
dio and Television annual meeting in June have been requested
for use by extension home economists around the country.
Response has been positive, with most of the tapes being used
at least three times—on the radio, with discussion groups
and as source material for newspaper columns.
MCA has arranged
with the National Association of Extension Home Economists to
sponsor a contest for the best multi-media packet which conveys
positive aspects of chemistry in extension home economics pro­
grams.
The winner of the CHEMM-PAK (Creative Home Economics
Multi-Media packet) award will receive $500.
Another contest,
sponsored originally by the General Federation of Women's
Clubs and MCA, will be continued alone by GFWC over the next
two years.
"It's your Country, Make it Work" was designed by
MCA to explain the U.S. economic system.
In addition to exhibits at the National Extension Homemakers
CMA 037626
Council and the National Association of Extension Home Econom­
ists, the consumer information Section also participated in
a National safety Council program.
Another participant used
the occasion to ask the consumer information manager to pre­
pare a program on food additives for the annual meeting of
the American Association of Orthodontists.
Two six-minute interviews of Edward Donley were conducted by
the section for the radio show "Good Living." Arrangements
also were made to interview Tom K. Smith Jr. and John Henske
for the program.
Magazines and trade papers continue to call
for reprint rights to "Your Breakfast Chemicals"—one of the
most recent uses showing a color photo of a typical break­
fast and its natural chemical ingredients in chemistry maga­
zine of the American Chemical Society.
Press Relations.
The section worked closely with Parade
magazine on its October cover story on Chemtrec.
parade
has a circulation of 55 million, plus multipliers.
Arrangements have been made to reprint the story.
The
section also has cooperated with Chemtrec in writing an
article on the emergency service for the monthly publica­
tion of the international Association of Fire chiefs and
on another article for Firehouse, a monthly magazine of
100,000 circulation that goes to the firefighter.
Chem­
trec and the section are also preparing a presentation talk
for the Chemtrec manager.
The manager of press relations
made the arrangements for an NBC television interview with
the president of MCA on the Love Canal incident and the pos­
sible ramifications of RCRA.
Staff also arranged the press
luncheon on the industry's energy conservation report that
featured MCA's president and members of the Energy Conserva­
tion Committee.
Industry representatives have been contacted to write articles
for the special journal of Commerce edition that highlights
the chemical industry on the day of the Semiannual Meeting.
Coverage of the meeting by the trade and general press has been
arranged,
press releases, of course, were issued on all major
statements and activities of the Association.
CMA 037627
T
Special publications.
MCA News in October published a special
insert on the good work of the Government Relations and Legal
Departments in the last session of Congress,
it also published
Representative Jim Martin's Chemical Forum address as an insert.
Dr. Martin's speech was made into a brochure, which will get
the widest possible distribution, including 400 copies that
were gratefully received by Dr. Martin himself.
A special
effort was made to call attention to the impressive work of
the chemical industry in energy conservation by publishing
the results of the latest enery report to DOE in a 12-page
booklet.
In addition to the figures, a statement by Mr.
Roland and a narrative section on "how the industry did it"
filled out the publication.
The booklet will get wide dis­
tribution, but its primary audience will be the Hill and
the bureaucrats in DOE.
The section wrote and edited some of
the materials that went into the work book for the Department
of Commerce briefing by the industry on November 14.
The
section also prepared this report.
j
Chemical Industry Councils and similar groups have expressed
great interest in having Mr. Roland speak to them.
The new
MCA president spoke to the Louisiana and Texas chemical as­
sociations in this past quarter and he is scheduled to speak
to the Los Angeles and Northern California groups in November
and to the Midwest CIC in the spring.

REPORT BY THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
WILLIAM M. STOVER
NOVEMBER 20, 1978
ADMINISTRATION LAUNCHES WAGE-PRICE GUIDELINES PROGRAM
President Carter, on October 24, unveiled his anti-inflation
plan in a personal appeal on television.
It contained three elements*.
a voluntary wage-price program
a promise to reduce the Federal budget deficit
a proposed tax rebate to workers receiving less
of a pay increase than the seven percent guide­
lines ,
i
i
On October 25, Alfred E. Kahnv Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics
ard, was named Chairman of the Council on Wage and Price Stability.
He is a 61-year-old economist with broad experience in and out of
government.
His many years as professor at Cornell were interspersed
with middle-level government positions in the Eisenhower, Kennedy
and Johnson Administrations,
He also was a staff economist at the
think-tank, Brookings Institute.
There seems to be a broad acceptance
of Kahn with little or no criticism of President Carter's choice.
t
The COWPS was immediately expanded from 40 staffers to 150
by transfer from other agencies.
Its offices are located a block
from the White House in the New Executive Office Building.
The emphasis on prices to date is on an individual company
basis.
Little or nothing is being done as yet on an industry basis.
Four hundred companies with sales over $500 million will be closely
monitored. Major companies in groups of ten were called in as early
as November 2 to discuss compliance.
Each company was allowed two
representatives, one a high level executive, the other, a technical
staffer.
Hundreds of companies are scheduled for similar meetings
in a month's time.
Reaction of U. S. business to the President's program is very
mixed.
Responses from chemical industry range from strong criticism
to wary acceptance with uniformly strong emphasis on government
budget control.
The problems for companies in complying with details (not called
gulations because the program is voluntary) are already becoming
evident.
Rarely is a government agency thrust into a regulatory
role so quickly.
Although the last wage-price control experience is
instructive, it does not provide answers to many new qu stions.
CMA 037629
There is some indication, just for one example, of dealing differ­
ently with various industries.
The chemical industry has had exaggerated price movement in
the period 1973-1975, followed by a more normal price movement
in the last three years.

It would appear that the choice of the period of 1976-1977 for
average price increase determination under the President's program
leaves little leeway for price improvement on an industry-wide basis.
The only part of the President's program requiring'legislation
is the tax rebate plan for those getting compensation increases
less than the seven percent guideline.
There are already signals
from Capitol Hill that this concept will be controversial when the
President presents it to the new Congress.
Industry-wide responses will be dealt with by MCA as the pro­
gram develops.
The Association staff will monitor developments in
the wage-price program, and an appropriate task group will task
group will make recommendations on wage-price issues and lead any
necessary communications efforts.
COSTLE HEADS PRESIDENT'S REGULATORY COUNCIL
President Carter has named Douglas M. Costle, Administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency, to chair the newly created anti­
inflation "Regulatory Council".
The Council will be comprised of
representatives of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy,
Health, Education and Welfare, Housing and Urban Development, Interior,
Justice, Labor, Treasury and Transportation.
The role of the Council
is to coordinate Federal rulemaking to ensure more efficient and
cost-effective regulations.
A staff of 10-20 people will be drawn
from the Federal agencies involved.
The Council's first assignment
is the development of a unified calendar of major Federal regulations,
to be published in the Federal Register by February 1, 1979.
The Regulatory Council will complement activities already re­
quired by Executive Order 12044 on regulatory reform.
These would
include the work of the Regulatory Analysis Review Group (RARG),
which is chaired by the Council of Economic Advisors with staff
support from the Council on Wage and Price Stability.
However,
the RARG has authority to review only 20 major regulations per year
with a maximum of four regulations per Federal agency.
CMA 037630
3
The initial proposals for the Regulatory Council would probably
have increased the influence of the Council of Economic Advisors,
and the Council on Wage and Price Stability to put a cap on costs
of regulations
However, strong pressure from Congress, environ­
mental groups and labor caused the President to abandon the economic
advisors - dominated Regulatory Council, and adopt the current
structure which is similar to the one proposed by agency chiefs as an
alternative
Under the present organizational concept, the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) and the Council on Wage and Price Stability
(COWPS) may participate, but only as observers.
Mr, Costle's appointment is expected to increase EPA's visability
and clout and his own stature within the Administration.
However, the
job, which runs through January 1, 1980, is likely to divert signifi­
cant amounts of time away from his duties as EPA Administrator.
ATTENTION TO CHEMICAL INCIDENTS CONTINUES
j
A wide range of governmental and legal actions confront our
industry because chemicals may be dangerous when misused, overused
or mishandled and because incidents resulting from such abuses
greatly concern the public.
Media attention and public concern, in fact, are intense and
^Pgrowing and show no signs of abating
This is in spite of the fact
that the chemical industry as a whole has had an excellent record
in handling hazardous chemicals on a daily basis without harm to
the public or the environment
I
I
Governmental and Congressional attention is just as intense, and
official bodies have proposed many solutions to problems arising from
chemical incidents.
They have done so, however, in a piecemeal and
uncoordinated manner
In their various forms, these solutions call for the transfer
of resources to provide the following:
- penalties for spills;
- restitution for individuals personally or economically harmed;
- remedies or neutralization of the effects of chemical
mishaps; and
- restoration of damaged sites and conditions.
The adjournment of the 95th Congress on October 15 has not
halted attempts by the Legislative and Executive Branches to devise
remedies for incidents related to overuse, misuse or improper dis­
posal of chemicals.
- The House Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations
held one day of hearings on October 30.
The subjects were contamina­
tion problems occuring in Hard man County, Tennes-'see, where Velsicol
Chemical Corporation disposed of chemical wastes at a company-owned
242-acre site, and the continuing problem of Love Canal in Niagara,
New York
A second hearing is tentatively scheduled for mid-December,
CMA 037831
4
to focus on existing laws and their applicability to hazardous waste
disposal, with particular emphasis on inactive or abandoned hazardous
waste disposal sites
- Just prior to adjournment, Representative John J. LaFalce
(D-Niagra-NY) introduced two bills which address these difficult
public policy questions.
The first would provide relief to all per­
sons injured as a result of toxic pollutants in the environment.
The second would establish a double-duty fund for maintenance of new
and existing dump sites and maintenance and reclamation of abandoned
sites.
Both bills, as well as other liability and compensation pro­
posals considered but not approved by the 95th Congress, will likely
be reintroduced in the 96th Congress,
- The EPA has indicated that it is giving top priority to an
effort to determine an appropriate system for providing remedial
action for inactive or abandoned waste disposal sites which pose a
threat to the environment.
It appears that the fund concept, de­
veloped in the 95th Congress - first for oil and then chemical
spills - will reappear in new legislative initiatives where restitu­
tion is involved.
- All indications suggest that the new Congress will return
to formation of public policy regarding liability for chemical
incidents early in 1979; staff preparation is already underway.
Both the House and the Senate have pledged early action on RCRA and
it is anticipated that amendments will be enacted in 1979.
It is
possible that liability and compensation provisions will be included
in amendments to RCRA and that they may either include, or set
-precedents for, other types of pollution problems resulting from
spills or unintentional discharge,
- The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee staff is
currently examining new Superfund programs for introduction in
1979,
- The House Commerce Committee and EPA are focusing on the
problems associated with disposal of hazardous wastes.
IMPORTANT TAX LEGISLATION ENACTED
Three pieces of tax legislation were enacted in the closing
days of the 95th Congress which are of interest to the chemical
industry.
Revenue Act of 1978: Most important of these is the Revenue
Act of 197S passed by Congress on October 15 and signed by the
President on November 6.
Following are major provisions of this
measure affecting corporations,
- Corporate income tax rate - The maximum corporate income
tax rate will be reduced from 487o to 46%, effective 1979.
CMA 037632
5
- Investment Tax Credit - The 107. investment tax credit and
the $100,000 used property limitation have been made permanent.
The amount of tax liability that may be offset by the credit will
increase from 507. to 907., phased in 10 percentage points per year
starting in 1979
The credit has been extended to expenditures
for the rehabilitation of structures which have been in use for at
least 20 years, effective October 31, 1978,
The full investment credit will be available for pollution
control facilities, even where 5-year amortization has been elected,
effective December 31, 1978
However, if the facility is financed
with tax-exempt industrial development bonds, the credit will be
allowed for onlyhalf the investment
The liberalization of the investment credit and the re­
duction in corporate income tax rate will reduce business sector
taxes by an estimated $6,4 billion in 1979
- Capital Gains - Effective October 31, 1978, for individuals,
607. (instead of 507.) of net capital gains may be deducted from gross
income. The alternative capital gains rate of 257. on the first
$50,000 of gains is repealed for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 1978
For corporations, the alternative capital gains tax will be
reduced from 307. to 287. for sales occurring after December 31, 1978.
- Product Liability Losses - Net operating losses attributable
to product liability losses may be carried back 10 years.
Companies
will be permitted to set aside reasonable amounts of after-tax
income as a reserve against future liability losses without trigger­
ing a penalty tax
- Business Entertainment - Deductions will be denied after
December 31, 1978 for certain entertainment facilities, such as
yachts and hunting lodges
Deductions will continue for country
club dues, for tickets to sporting events, and for business meal
expenses
Foreign Earned Income Act of 1978: For taxable years beginning
after December 3l, 1977, this Act eliminated the flat exclusion
for Americans working abroad and replaces it with a combination of
cost-of-living, excess housing costs, education, and travel de­
ductions
Taxpayers living in certain hardship locations would be allowed
a special $5,000 deduction in order to fully compensate them and to
encourage U S citizens to accept employment in those areas.
Fringe Benefits (PL 95-427) : This Act, passed in September
and signed by the President in early October, prohibits IRS from
issuing final regulations relating to the taxation of mployee
fringe benefits before 1980
It also prohibits the Treasury Department or IRS from issuing
rulings or final regulations concerning the deductibility of certain
commuting or transportation expenses incurred before 1980.
CMA 037633
OIL PRICING CONTINUES
Since its enactment in 1973, the Emergency Petroleum Allocation
Act (EPAA), as amended by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of
1975 (EPCA), has provided the basic authority for Executive Branch
regulation of the pricing and allocation of crude oil, residual
fuel oil, and each refined petroleum product.
- Current Authority:
Under these laws the President is required
to regulate the price of oil until May 31, 1979.
His authority to
alter the present oil pricing regulatory scheme prior to that date is
subject to Congressional review, and thus a possible veto by either
House of Congress.
The President does have the authority, however,
to allow the average domestic price of oil to rise ten percent
annually under a price-adjustment mechanism.
Since the average
domestic oil price has been kept well below the legislated ceiling
price, there is a significant amount of accumulated percentage in­
crease allowable between now and May, should the President decide to
employ this authority
- Presidential Authority from May 31, 1979, through September
30, 1981: On May 31, 1979, the Congressional mandate to control the
price of oil expires
After that date the President has discretionary
authority to promulgate and amend pricing regulations or issue other
directives, through September, 1981
However, it is a matter of dis­
pute whether this "discretionary authority" remains subject to Con­
gressional review and veto limitations.
- Petroleum Industry Position:
The petroleum industry supports
decontrolled domestic oil prices and would like to see the President's
"discretionary authority" after May 31, 1979, interpreted so as to
provide flexibility to abolish controls, and without the Congressional
review and limitations.
- Chemical Industry Position: MCA has testified on the pricing
issue on numerous occasions,
We support any action which will permit
petroleum prices to rise to world levels through decontrol or phasedremoval of price controls.
This would permit primary energy prices
to reflect replacement costs and provide the maximum incentive to
develop new resources and expand the supply base.
- U. S. Price Relative to Major Foreign Competitors: The cost
of crude oil and natural gas to U S domestic chemical producers is
below that of foreign competitors.
The average cost for a barrel of
crude oil charged to U. S refineries includes six different inputs:

The composite price of $12.06 gives the United States a

countries buying crude oil at the world price of over $14 per
barrel.
However, crude oil is paid for all over the world with
The countries having currencies which have
appreciated against the dollar are getting, in effect, reduced
prices on the oil.
Two strong chemical competitive countries,
Japan and West Germany, are an example.
Japan paid 15.3 percent
less for its oil in April, 1978, than for the year 1977. West
Kermany paid 11.7 percent less.
1978 ELECTION RESULTS PRODUCE CHANGES
-The Republican Party has staged a modest comeback both in the
national legislature and statehouses throughout the country, although
Democrats continue to maintain political dominance control.
For the
96th Congress, Republicans achieved a net gain of 12 seats in the
U. S. House of Representatives and 3 seats in the Senate.
(The
Senate gain is dependent on confirmation of John Warner's victory
in Virginia.
In the House, Republicans could gain another seat or
two, depending on the outcome of still undecided contests.) The
new membership of the House will be comprised of 276 Democrats and
159 Republicans.
The new Senate will include 59 Democrats and 41
Republicans.
At the state level, Republicans won 15 governorships including
such important states as Texas, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Wisconsin
and Nebraska previously held by Democrats.
This represents a net
gain of 6, bringing the governorships now held by Republicans up
from 12 to a total of 18,
The G.O.P. also gained majorities or
ties in 15 state legislatures, and achieved a net gain of approxi­
mately 300 state legislative seats.
Of greater significance than mere numerical changes are trends
_toward the right, Republican Party resurgence at the grass roots
pvel, and changes in the leadership of Congressional Committees
lich impact on the chemical industry.

- House and Senate Leadership On the Democratic side of the House, Speaker O'Neill (MA),
Majority Leader Wright (TX) and Caucus Chairman Foley (WA) were
returned to Congress November 7, and are expected to be re-elected
to their House leadership positions December 4
John Brademas (IN)
is expected to be reappointed Party Whip
Regarding House Republicans, there is speculation affecting
Minority Leader John Rhodes (AZ) and/or John Anderson (IL), Chairman
of the Republican Conference (the number 3 G 0 P, position),
Rhodes
has been criticized by conservative House Republicans for a lack of
aggressive leadership and his willingness to compromise with the
opposition
It appears that only Republican Whip Robert Michel (IL)
could be a real threat to Rhodes, but the two are close friends, and
Michel is thought unlikely to mount a challenge
Michel is next in
line to succeed retired Elford Cederberg (MI) as ranking minority
member on the House Appropriations Committee, but Republicans have
traditionally foreclosed a member from holding leadership and ranking
committee posts simultaneously
However, next behind Michel in
seniority on the Appropriations Committee is Silvio Conte (MA), re­
garded as a "big spender" and too liberal by many Republicans,
Con­
sequently, there is talk that Rhodes could placate the conservatives
and finesse a challenge to his Minority leadership position by backing
a waiver allowing Michel to be both Whip and top Republican on
Appropriations, one of the most powerful Committees in the House,
An early test of the suggested new conservatism of the House
may ensue if Guy Vander Jagt (MI) challenges liberal John Anderson (IL)
-for leadership of the caucus, known as the Republican Conference.
The
Republican Policy Committee chair is also open due to the retirement
of Del Clawson (CA)
Bill Frenzel (MN) is expected to win this post
as head of the Republican Research Committee, which could set up a
contest between moderate Lawrence Coughlin (PA) and conservative
Trent Lott (MS)
In the Senate, Democrats are expected to elect Warren Magnuson (WA)
to succeed retired James Eastland (MS) as President Protem
They will
undoubtedly re-elect Robert Byrd (WV) as Majority Leader and Alan
Cranston (CA) as Majority Whip
Senate Republicans are expected to
re-elect Howard Baker (TN) as Minority Leader and Ted Stevens (AK)
as Minority Whip
- Committee Changes U
S. House of Representatives
House Committees have undergone dramatic changes toward new
and younger leadership in recent years, and when the 96th Congress
convenes in January, only two Chairmen will have held their posts
for more than six years
(Education and Labor's Carl Perkins (D-KY)
and Commerce's Harley Staggers (D-WV)
Because of retirements, defeats,
convictions, indictments and reprimands, at ;least five and possibly
seven of the 22 standing Committees will have new Chairmen, and the
Subcommittees will be playing a game of'inusical Chairmen"
CMA 037636
Richard Bolling (D-MO) will become Chairman of the important
Rules Committee,
He is even more liberal, and is expected to work
more closely with the leadership than the retiring Chairman, James
Delaney (D-NY)
Claude Pepper (D-FL) becomes the ranking Democrat
on the Committee
There will be some changes on the powerful
Appropriations Committee, as Jamie Whitten (D-MS) succeeds 43-year
veteran George Mahon (D-TX) as Chairman, and Elford Cederberg (R-MI)
steps down as ranking Republican
Also on the Appropriations Com­
mittee, Dan Flood (D-PA) could be forced to give up his Chairman­
ship of the Labor-HEW Subcommittee (which has jurisdiction over
. OSHA appropriations), because of his recent indictment
The Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, which has
jurisdiction over environmental matters, toxic substances, solid
waste disposal, and various Federal health and cancer programs, is
in a state of disarray
Three of its most important Subcommittee
Chairmanships will need to be filled: Health (Paul Rogers, D-FL,
retired), Oversight and Investigations (John Moss, D-CA, retired),
and Transportation (Fred Rooney, D-PA, defeated)
I
I
j
t
j
i
Leading contenders for the Health Subcommittee Chair are David
Satterfield (D-VA) and Richardson Preyer (D-NC)
Satterfield is
perceived by a number of Committee Members as too conservative to
head this key Subcommittee with jurisdiction over clean air, drug
reform legislation, saccharin, and other important health and cancerrelated issues.
Preyer, a relative moderate and former Federal
judge, respected by Committee colleagues and the House leadership,
would be the next choice
But he has family connections and investments in the pharmaceutical industry which could cause an apparent
conflict in the Subcommittee’s work on drug regulation and FDA legis­
lation
Bob Eckhardt (D-TX) is favored in the contest for the Chair of
the publicity-prone Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.
If
he succeeds, Eckhardt will have to give up his Chairmanship of the
Consumer Protection Subcommittee, which will open up this Sub­
committee's all-important jurisdiction over the Toxic Substances
Control Act
The situation is also uncertain for the Transportation
Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over RCRA, hazardous materials
derailments, and other environmental issues
Somewhere down the
line, such leading liberal Democrats as James Scheuer (D-NY),
are going to get their chance to Chair one of these Subcommittees.
The Ways and Means Committee, responsible for Federal tax laws,
will lose 6 Democratic Members, including ranking Democrat James
Burke (MA), Omar Burleson (TX), Joe Waggoner (LA), and Otis Pike
Of special significance is the retirement of Joe Waggoner,
long-time friend of business, leader of Southern conservatives in
the House, and Chairman of the Miscellaneous Revenue Measures Subcommittee
Leading contenders for his Subcommittee Chairmanship are
All 12 Republicans
on the Committee are returning
They should pick up an additional
seat on the Committee due to the additional Republicans elected to
the House, which changes the ratio of Democrats-to-Republicans
on Committees.
CMA 037637

T
10
On the Interior Committee, Morris Udall (D-AZ) returns as
Chairman, Ranking Republican Joe Skubitz (KS) retired, and Don
Clausen (CA) is expected to become top Republican.
Phil Ruppe's
(R-MI) retirement eliminates one proponent of the PBB indemnifica­
tion legislation, but others will undoubtedly come forward to
espouse this cause.
On the Public Works Committee, Harold Johnson (CA) returns as
Chairman, and William Harsha (OH) as Ranking Republican.
A change could occur in the Chairmanship of the Government
Operations Subcommittee on Manpower.
This is the Subcommittee
which held extensive hearings on chemical hazards in the workplace
and has played a key role in pressuring OSHA into adopting such
recent regulations as the generic carcinogen standard, chemical
substances identification, and access to employees medical records.
Cardiss Collins (D-IL) is the present Chairwoman, but if Charles
Diggs (D-MI) is forced to relintjuish his African Affairs Subcommittee
"Chairmanship because of his recent conviction for payroll irregular­
ities, Ms. Collins may take over Diggs' Chair.
This would open
her Manpower Subcommittee Chairmanship to either Glenn English (D-OK)
or Elliot Levitas (D-GA).
On the Commerce Committee, Howard Cannon (D-NV) returns as
Chairman, but James Pearson's (R-KS) retirement and Robert Griffen's
(R-MI) defeat opens the Ranking Republican post for Ted Stevens (R-AK).
However, if re-elected Minority Whip, Stevens would be precluded
from holding this Committee post, which would then go to Bob Packwood
Chairman Jennings Randolph (D-WV) and Ranking Republican Robert
Stafford (R-VT) return to the important Environment and Public Works
Committee.
Henry Jackson (D-WA) returns as Chairman of the Energy Committee,
but the retirement of James Abourezk (D-SD) and defeats of Floyd
Haskell (D-CO) and Wendell Anderson (D-MN) open three Democratic
seats on the Committee.
Retirement of Clifford Hansen (R-WY) opens
up the Ranking Republican position for Mark Hatfield (R-OR).
On the Finance Committee, Chairman Russell Long (D-LA) returns,
but defeats of Floyd Haskell (D-CO) and William Hathaway (D-ME)
vacate two Subcommittee Chairmanships, which will probably be filled
by the two Democrats appointed to their seats. Ranking Minority Member
Carl Curtis (R-NE) retirement opens the way for Robert Dole (R-KS)
to fill that slot, but to do so Dole must give up his Ranking
Minority position on the Agriculture Committee
There may also be some changes on the Human Resources Committee
which has jurisdiction over such major legislation as labor law
reform, workers compensation, ERISA and OSHA.
If Ranking Minority
Member Jacob Javits (R-NY) takes the Ranking Republican post on
the Foreign Relations Committee, as expected, he will lose his
CMA 037638
f
11
ranking position and some staff on the Human Resources Committee.
Chairman Harrison Williams (D-NJ) may give up his Labor Subcom­
mittee Chairmanship for another Subcommittee of a different
Committee, and then merge his Labor Subcommittee into the full
Human Resources Committee.
- Timetable for Selection of Committee Members and Chairmen
During the first week in December, House Members will elect
their leadership:
Speaker, Majority Leader and Majority Whip
by Democrats, and Minority Leader and Minority Whip by Republi­
cans,
Recommendations for Committee assignments on both sides
will be considered during the interim before the new Congress
convenes January 15, 1979.
Soon thereafter, the Democratic
Caucus will meet to approve Committee Members, Committee Chair­
men, and Appropriations Subcommittee Chairmen.
Subseauently, the
Committees will meet to select their Subcommittee Chairmen.
The
House Republican Conference will undertake a similar process
for Minority positions on Committees and Subcommittees.
In the Senate, the Democratic Caucus will elect their
President Protem, Majority Leader and Whip on or about January
Soon thereafter, the Democratic Steering Committee
|11 meet to make recommendations on Committee assignments and
lairmenships, which must be approved by the entire Democratic
Caucus.
The Senate Republican Conference will undertake a
similar process.

DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING
DOMESTIC INTERNATIONAL SALES CORPORATIONS (DISC)
CMA has learned that the Treasury Department is considering
a modification of the Domestic International Sales Corporation
(DISC) provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. This consideration
has arisen because of allegations by European Common Market members
that the DISC provision violates the GATT Subsidies Code.
Under present law, the DISC provisions permit a corporation
to defer current U.S. income taxation on up to one-half of its
export profits so long as those profits are devoted to export
related activities.
In 1979, the latest year for which official
Treasury Department figures are available, the chemical and
allied products industries deferred $288.4 million in taxes from
DISC sales or 1.5 percent of total gross receipts. At issue,
however, is not only the value of the current tax incentive for
DISC related activities, but the tax treatment of previously
deferred DISC income.
Since the DISC provisions were enacted in
1971, total tax deferrals could be substantial for many CMA
member companies.
At the September meeting, CMA's Board of Directors expressed
its concern over developments related to DISC and directed the Tax
Policy Committee to review this problem and to develop an appropriate
CMA response and strategy. On October 14, 1981, the Foreign Tax
Task Group met on DISC and a representative will present a status
report to the Board at its November meeting.
In the interim, CMA
President Robert A. Roland has written directly to Treasury
Secretary Donald T. Regan to stress the prime importance of DISC
to the chemical industry and CMA's desire to be consulted in the
development of this legislation.

EXHIBIT C
REPORT ON DISC
REPORT OF THE TAX POLICY
COMMITTEE ON DISC
CMA enthusiastically applauds the decision of the Reagan Administration
to continue its support of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which
pertain to Domestic International Sales Corporations (DISC).
For some time the Treasury Department and the Office of the Special
Trade Representative had considered proposals to modify the DISC provisions.
This review stemmed from allegations of our major European trading partners
that those provisions violate the GATT Subsidies Code.
It is understood that the GATT Council may make a final decision in the
near future on whether DISC violates GATT. It Is possible that such a decision
could be delayed for an 18-24 month period. CMA is most encouraged that the
Administration will vigorously defend the DISC provisions. However, if it Is
ultimately decided that DISC violates GATT, the United States will be faced
with repealing or replacing OISC, or retaining DISC and allowing GATT members
to impose countervailing duties and to take trade reprisals. This would prob­
ably result in GATT becoming a weakened International organization.
The DISC issue is very important to the economics of the U.S. chemical
industry. Export sales comprise a significant portion of total industry sales,
and export profits are likewise significant. The elimination of the DISC
provisions would substantially affect the ability of the U.S. chemical industry
to compete In International markets. Moreover, if DISC were eliminated and
accumulated earnings were made subject to tax, chemical companies would see
a substantial plunge in available capital and earnings reported to shareholders
in that year because of payment of the tax or an increase In tax reserves.
It is possible that DISC could be replaced by a different export incentive,
such as a foreign International sales company. Regardless of what Is proposed,
ongoing industry effort will be required to ensure that any DISC replacement
is at least as beneficial as DISC. The key questions that must be considered
in this regard are the treatment of existing tax deferrals and Intercompany
pricing rules.
In view of these considerations, the Tax Policy Committee recommends that
CMA take the following positions with respect to DISC:
CMA supports DISC as the minimum response of the U.S.
Government to an effective export policy. CMA and
CMA 037746
member companies should urge Secretary Regan. Ambassador
8rock, and other representatives of the Government not to
concede that OISC might violate GATT. European countries
should be made to understand that the United States believes
that DISC Is not as strong an export incentive as the effect
of the tax systems of those countries and that the United
States Is committed to and will provide an Incentive no
less strong than DISC.
CMA should, however, direct its Tax Policy Committee to
study, develop, and pursue alternative export Incentives
so that CMA could respond Imnediately with an acceptable
alternative to any action of GATT, the Treasury, or the
Congress that might lead to a likely repeal of DISC.
In its activities, the Tax Policy Conmlttee believes it
should pursue three fundamental principles. First, Any
alternative export Incentive shall be at least as beneficial
to exports on an overall basis as the present DISC provisions.
Second. Any alternative export incentive must contain
clear and equitable principles for the pricing of exports
along the lines of section 994 of the DISC rules. Third.
There should, be no tax Imposed as part of any changeover
to an alternative entity on present accumulated DISC
earnings. More than $10 billion in current U.S. corporate
Income taxes may have been deferred by American Industry
through the operation of the DISC provisions. Of this
amount the chemical Industry has deferred more than $1
billion In taxes that would be Imnedlately charged
against earnings reported to shareholders under generally
accepted principles of accounting if the DISC provisions
are repealed.
The Tax Policy Comnittee will report to the Board of
Directors should a change In circumstances occur that
necessitates reconsideration of the policy described
herein.

attempt to develop concrete means to express support for President
economic programs. To accomplish this, staff was directed to conduct
to determine what effect the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981
likely to have on company Investment for research and development.
With the cooperation of several member company experts, CMA staff has
developed a short questionnaire which seeks to determine any chahges
anticipated in R 4 0 budgets as a result of the Tax Act. The questionnaire
also seeks to determine the likelihood of shifts in R & 0 activities
from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. firms. Confidentiality of all responses
will be maintained. This is being done to determine if company size has
any effect on the amount of resources alloted to R 4 0 activities.
It is anticipated that the questionnaires will be mailed to CMA
Executive Contacts the last week In October, with a requested return date
of November 16. The tabulated results are anticipated by Oecember 1.
All CMA members are urged to complete the questionnaire so that a

.MEMBER SERVICES DEPARTMENT
STATUS REPORT
The creation of this department was announced at the January
1981 Board Meeting.
Consequently, it has been in existance
for only 10 months.
It is staffed by one professional and a
secretary.
RATIONALE FOR CREATING DEPARTMENT
The chemical industry has been under critical pressure for
many years by environmentalists, the media and government, both
legislative and regulatory.
As the industry is widely spread across the country, with some
well-defined areas of heavy concentration, these pressures also
have been widely spread. Eventually, the pressures extended
to and were applied by national environmental groups, national
media and the Federal government.
CMA had no formal mechanism at state and local levels to counter
the efforts directed against the industry.
One was needed - a broadly based one to strengthen CMA's advocacy
effectiveness on the national scene. The need became even more
evident with the election of President Reagan and his commitment
to defederalization.
This turning to the states by the Federal government in no way
lessened the absolute necessity for strength in Washington.
It
reaffirmed the need, for now the industry was to face fighting
on 50 fronts (the states) with much of which would take place
lighting the fuse on issues to explode state-by-state right up
to Congress.
In the early '50s, some state and local groups representing
the chemical industry in their respective areas were formed,
largely on their initiative. CMA (then MCA) had an on-again,
off-again love affair with these autonomous organizations.
Some flourished, some died, others were quite passive.
In the
'60s and early '70s, when support was vital, CMA couldn't decid
what to do.
Eventually, those that survived went their own way.
The relationship with CMA was not good.
That was how matters stood in January 1981.
(See attached
brochure: Today, Testerday, Tomorrow, a Brief Look at State
Organizations.)
CMA 037762
DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVE
Build a strong, broadly based chemical industry state and local
structure to support CMA at the point of the pyramid in
Washington by:
Developing a close, cooperative association with existing
associations, councils and chemical industry committees;
Helping to found additional similar groups where
warranted;
Working in like manner with the corporate headquarters
of CMA members and, through them, with their plants
in local areas;
Studying the chemical industry, seeking to find
companies eligible for CMA membership and recruit them
through the Membership Committee and the Board, while
working closely with the CMA offices of Secretary and
Treasurer;
Serving CMA through eyes and ears attuned to problems
upon which the Association should act positively;
Acting as the catalyst to bring Association resources
to bear on problems and assure that needed seminars,
symposia, policy positions and programs are fielded
where needed, principally with state organizations.
ACTION TO DATE
Top priority has been given to strengthening existing state
groups and our ties with them.
This priority also included
helping in firming the establishment of four just coming on
stream when the department was created.
The four brought to
18 the number of groups. One, Southern California, has since
merged with the California Chemical Industry Council to constitute
a blanket organization for the state.
It will, however, continue
as a satellite group as most of the plant operations are in the
south, and there is need for it to continue to meet on concerns
peculiar to its area.
(See inside back cover of brochure for
list of groups.)
The newest groups are in New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut
and Tennessee.
with member company personnel, we are working on building
relationships with the chemical groups instituted under the
wings of the Associated Industries of Kentucky and the Virginia
Manufacturers Association.
We also are actively exploring
the possibilites of assisting in the creation of units in North
Carolina, Arkansas and Iowa.
CMA 037763
To help us focus on critical areas, we conducted two studies,
both of which are appended.
The first was divided into two parts.
The initial section
covered the top 26 states as to value of shipments.
All existing
state groups fell into this category.
In conjunction with the
State Activities Division of the Government Relations Department,
we then selected those remaining states most likely to give
the industry problems and ranked them also as to value of
shipments.
This came to 15, and none has a state chemical
group.
Other categories in the study, and ranked, were value added,
number of chemical employees in production, the percent of this
to all manufacturing employees in the state, the percent of
chemical employees to total state population, the number of
CMA companies in the state and the number of their plants,
and the number of CMA companies in the state with $100 million
or more in annual sales.
Of the three states currently under study for new groups,
North Carolina and Iowa fall into the top 26.
Kentucky and
Virginia, with whom we are working as noted earlier, alsp
are in this grouping.
Thus, we either have existing or under
study organizations in 19 of the 26. Those without are targets
and include Indiana, South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Massachus tts,
Maryland and Wisconsin.
Arkansas falls into the set of 15, ranking
third in value of shipments.
These studies have been distributed to CMA staff for needs
as they see fit and either have or will be given to all state
groups.
The second study, also attached, shows us the participation
by CMA member companies in existing state groups, according
to their membership rosters supplied us by October 1, 1981.
As these groups accept members the year around, it is possible
some CMA member companies have joined or applied or are consider­
ing joining since receipt of rosters.
The brunt of support is borne by 15 to 20 percent of our members.
There are a number with spotty memberships; some with none.
These are targets of opportunity for broadening the industry's
outreach effort.
t
f
To consolidate our efforts to date and to further increase
mutually beneficial working relationships, we scheduled the
First Annual Meeting of State Groups on November 4, the day
following the Semiannual Meeting.
3
i
As of this writing, all but one of the state groups will
participate and there is reason to believe attendance will
be 100 percent.
Kentucky, Virginia and Iowa representatives
also will attend.
j
CMA 037764
an inducement/ each group was provided one "Freebee" to
the Semiannual and State Meetings.
Any additional attendees
bore the full charge.
Indicated attendance/ again as of this
writing, is approximately 40 or more.
as
The program included the vice presidents for technical, legal,
government relations and communications spelling out the services
available to state groups. An equal portion of the program
featured actions by state groups.
One section was devoted to
what they felt they need from us and how needs can be satisfied.
Since the founding of the department, I have visited, on their
home grounds, every existing group at least once.
I have
had two or more visits with a number, speaking at Executive
Committee, Semiannual and Annual Meetings.
The message:
what we are trying to do and the how and why of it. The
reception, without exception, has been gratifying.
They feel
wanted, needed and appreciate the outstretched hand. Any
reluctance has largely been overcome.
Cooperation by all segments of CMA staff has been excellent.
When called upon, response has been thorough and prompt. Also,
there has been no reluctance to call upon Member Services for
assistance in reaching state groups when specific needs exist.
Further, many valuable suggestions have come from various
departments.
ACTION FORECAST
All attending will be asked to critique the First
Annual Meeting so that the second can be better,
more fruitful.
New state groups will be formed as needed, and if
possible, as quickly as conditions permit.
The promotion of joint meetings by state groups will
be furthered.
The Texas Chemical Council already
has invited the California Chemical Council to meet
jointly at its Annual Meeting.
If this is successful,TCC plans to continue such efforts with others.
The possibility of two to three regional meetings
of state groups under CMA sponsorship will be studied
and begun, if feasible.
Efforts will continue to help state groups build
membership.
Hopefully, there will be time to institute a state
group newsletter.
Services and visits, as initiated, will continue
as needed.

REPORT TO THE
CMA EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Since its first nesting in January, 1980, the Special Programs
Advisory Committee (SPAC) developed guidelines for Che conduct of special
programs, reviewed all of the ongoing special programs, and made
recommendations on all proposed new programs. Significant recommendations
resulting from SPAC's reviews are summarized below,
PROPOSED NEV PROGRAMS
Arsenic
SPAC recommended approval of a new program on Arsenic.
The primary
objective of the program is the education of people within regulatory
agencies through a jointly sponsored arsenic symposium with the National
Bureau of Standards. This symposium (November 4-6, 1981) will provide a
means for Industry and government agencies to come to an understanding of
cost-effective regulation of arsenic as a hazardous material through
knowledge of production and use patterns, toxicologic properties, and the
presence of arsenic in the environment.
Ethylene Oxide
The Ethylene Oxide Industry Council was formed to (1) develop information
regarding responsible industry programs to control exposure to ethylene
oxide; (11) to develop relevant scientific, technological, and economic
data; and, (ill) to present such Information and data to U. S. governmental
bodies considering regulatory controls pertaining to ethylene oxide so as
to assure that such standards, regulations or policies are reasonable,
scientifically sound, and economically and socially effective.
SPAC
recommended approval of the formation of this Council*
Polychlorinated Biphenyls
Under the Chemical Regulations Advisory Committee (CRAG) companies affected
by che Court's decision on Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) initiated two
surveys to provide EPA with information for promulgating a final
regulation. The estimated cost of these surveys and other consultant fees
was $163,000; CRAC budgeted the original phase and then asked chat the
program be moved to the Special Programs Division. SPAC approved che first
phase of a PCB special program which will Include conducting two surveys,
analyzing che data from che surveys and participating in formal rulemaking.
CRAC contributed $30,000 toward this effort, SPAC will review the program
at che end of Phase I and will make a recommendation on whether Phase II
should be continued under Special Programs.
New Source Performance Standard on Non-Metalllc Minerals
I>ie to lack of funding, the Environmental Management Committee transferred
a request for a new program on Non-Metalllc Minerals to che Special
Programs Division. Initially the burden of these regulations would have
CMA 037759
b««n on the non-metallic mineral Industry alone, but the precedent would be
set for the regulatory agency to take such actlona on ocher sectors of the
chemical industry. SPAC recommended approval of this program with the
Special Programs division providing all administration and the
Environmental Division providing all technical support. Subsequent to this
recommendation, the SPA, under the new administration, decided not to
pursue the proposed regulation, and therefore, the SPAC recommendation was
not brought to the Executive Committee.
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS TO PANELS
Acrylonitrile
In 1975 CMA signed a $576,300 contract to Investigate the possible toxic
effects and the pharmacodynamics of ingested and Inhaled acrylonitrile in
laboratory animals.
In 1973 the contract was amended and the contract
amount raised to $647,900. The contractor submitted the report on the last
phase of this study on December 9, 1980. At the same time, the contractor
submitted a final Invoice containing a cost-overrun of $134,000.
CMA has
Initiated balloting of panel members to determine if they approve payment
of this cost overrun. Several ballots remain outstanding.
Upon SPAC's
recommendation the CMA legal department confirmed that CMA is not
reponslble, under the terms of the contract, for the overrun.
Although
several companies have still not responded with their ballots, staff and
CMA counsel are working closely with the contractor and the panel to
resolve the cost overrun.
Chlorobenzenes
When EPA issued a TSCA Section 4(a) Draft Test Rules Package on
chlorobenzenes two CMA groups became Involved. The CRAC Testing Task Group
identified broed policy and legal Issues and spoke with EPA regarding the
precedent-setting Implications* The program panel, which has always been
research-oriented, established a Toxicology Regulatory Task Group to
address specific toxicological Issues concerning the six chlorobenzenes
recommended for Immediate testing.
In addition, SOCMA formed the
Chlorobenzenes Producers Association to assume an advocacy position.
All
of these groups worked together to form a unified Industry position on the
Test Rules Package. SPAC recommended that these groups continue with the
work they have begun until the Federal Register notice comes out.
SPAC
further recommended that as most of the companies participating in CMA
(research) and SOCMA (advocacy) programs are the same, a consideration be
given to bringing both the chlorobenzenes research and advocacy programs
under one umbrella organization at an appropriate time.
Ethylene Dibromlde
Audits of the MCI and NIOSH studies were completed and an independent
auditor found that both of these studies were acceptable. SPAC, therefore,
on August 25, 1981, supported the panel's decision to disband although they
suggested a new panel be formed to continue for advocacy.
Following this
decision, OSHA received a petition from the Teamsters Union to lower the
exposure limit on EDB from 20,000 ppb to 15 ppb. SPAC reviewed plans for a
reconstituted panel on October 20, 1981',
2
CMA 037760
Fluorocarbons
SFAC approved a limited advocacy role for the Fluorocarbons Program Panel
so chat the panel could make statements on science.
The first was in
response to the November 1979 NAS Report, "Stratospheric Ozone Depletion by
Halocarbons: Chemistry and Transport."
SPAC recommended that the panel continue its limited advocacy charter and
appointed two members to explore appropriate means of coordinating the
Alliance, the CMA Fluorocarbons Panel and the CMA Section 4 Testing Task
Force of the Chemical Regulations Advisory Committee.
Ketones
SPAC endorsed the panel's plans to establish an early dialogue with EPA
regarding the anticipated TSCA Section 4(a) rule.
However, SPAC
recommended that the panel's charter be amended to Include epidemiologic
studies and possible evaluation of the environmental effects of ketone.
Phthalate Esters
In early 1980 the Phthalate Esters panel planned a material handling survey
of the manufacturers, distributors and users of phthalates. However, since
CMA is a trade association representing manufacturers, SPAC recommended
that all action be cabled until the Society of the Plastics Industry could
be contacted. In the meantime a study by the National Cancer Institute
became available which for the first time raised health affects concerns
for phthalate esters.
In addition, based upon NCI's findings, EPA
requested additional information on PMNs for phthalate esters.
The panel
was concerned that EPA had taken regulatory action on preliminary
information and that EPA might come up with an unreasonable TSCA section
4(a) rule. SPAC recommended that the panel add advocacy to Its charter and
that they establish a dialogue with EPA on developing a voluntary- test
standard.
This was a valuable recommendation as can be seen by the
subsequent accomplishments of this panel (section 7.4 of the attachment).
Titanium Dioxide
SPAC recommended that in the absence of any significant findings in the
long-term Inhalation study in progress at duPont, the pmnel consider
disbanding.
Vinyl Chloride
The Vinyl Chloride Panel hired an independent consultant to review the work
performed by Industrial Bio-Test (IBT) under contract to CMA.
This
consultant recommended that CMA examine animal tissues still available from
the study. The panel did not act upon this recommendation. However, they
did ask IBT for a refund of the $130,000 they had already paid under Che
contract. The panel was waiting for financial resolution with IBT before
submitting a final report to government agencies.
SPAC recommended that
the panel not wait for resolution before submitting a final and report chat
they act up a th
consultants recommendation to do additional
histopathology. The Panel followed this rec mmendatlon.
3
CMA 037761
Zinc Dialkyl Dlthlophosphata
SPAC heard a proposal for a new special program on ZDDP. Although this new
panel urns interested in studying the reproductive role of ZDDP in rats and
rabbits SPAC recommended that they consider undertaking an epidemiological
study.
SPAC approved the panel's draft charter with a strong
recommendation that it be expanded to include advocacy. The panel followed
this recommendation.
SPAC'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
SFAC's review of ongoing special programs, as well as proposals for
new programs, concentrated on scientific and policy Issues, the adequacy of
professional and financial support from participating companies, the
availability of CMA resources, and the inclusion of advocacy in the panels'
charter.
The first year of reviews under the new Special Programs Guidelines
provided the members of SPAC with valuable insight into the workings of
program panels. In the future, SPAC will concentrate on the significant
activities of the panels since their last meeting with SPAC.
SPAC will
also make sure chat recommendations made during previous reviews were acted
upon. Staff will keep SPAC informed of new actions as they occur, rather
than waiting for a scheduled meeting.
Further background on the functioning of the Special Programs
Division, its major accomplishments during the past year, and a summary of
each program is attached to this report.
SPAC has now completed its first year, as authorized by the Executive
Committee.
SPAC is performing a valuable oversight function for CMA
Special Programs and I therefore recommend re-authorization of this
Committee for a second year.

ATTACHMENT 1
BIOMEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIAL PROGRAMS
AN OVERVIEW
MISSION
Th« mission of the CMA Biomedical and Environmental Special Programs
Division (Special Programs) Is to provide manufacturers, processors, and/
or users of a chemical or chemicals with the opportunity to support collec­
tively research and/or advocacy on specific chemicals.
When referring to
Special Programs, advocacy Involves external communication, not designed
solely for information exchange, that relates to existing or developing
regulations, legislation or litigation. CMA serves participating companies
by providing proper and effective administration of programs.
Scientific Information developed through research programs should pro­
mote the health and safety of the general public and of workers Involved in
manufacturing, processing, and using these chemicals.
All significant
findings and reports of CKA-adminlstared research programs are available to
the public In a timely manner.
2.0 DIVISION SUMMARY
CMA approved the first "special project" in 1972. The Initial special
projects were exclusively research oriented. The Intent at that time was
for CMA to collect and disburse the necessary funds, contract for the
research to be done, and provide meeting facilities and surveillance over
the conduct of the meetings.
The time requirements on CMA staff were
expected to be minimal since the participating companies would provide all
technical expertise and management skills necessary to conduct the pro­
grams. The administration of these programs was assigned to CMA secretar­
ies of several standing committees.
The number of special programs administered by CMA Increased at a mod­
erate rate from 1972 to 1979. By the end of 1979, CMA was administering to
seventeen special programs. Since 1980, requests for CMA to undertake new
special programs have increased considerably. This increase Is due mainly
to increased activities related to the Toxic Substances Control Act, Clean
Air Act and Clean Water Act.
The Special Programs Division presently
coordinates research and/or advocacy for twenty-three special programs.
CMA took its first steps toward advocacy In 1977 when the Benzene Pro­
gram Panel was formed in response to a worker-exposure standard proposed by
OSHA. Industry believed that the scientific studies on which this standard
was based were flawed. The Benzene Panel's Charter was to develop a sound
technical base that could be used by industry to challenge the proposed
regulations. The Benzene Panel’s Charter was expanded in November 1978 to

teen program panels have broadened chair charters to include advocacy or
begun programs which included advocacy*
In September 1979, cha CMA Executive Committee authorized cha forma­
tion of a Special Programs Advisory Group (SPAG).
SPAG was subsequently
given tha status of Special Comalctee which is now known as the Special
Programs Advisory Committee (SPAC). Three major responsibilities of SPAC
are: (1) co review requests for individual product advocacy by special pro­
gram panels and determine that appropriate conditions for these advocacy
positions are met; (2) to review each ongoing special program at least once
a year to provide guidance based on SPAC members' expertise; and, (3) to
make certain that advocacy actions of each Special Program are in harmony
with CMA Standing CommLttae positions.
Appendix A lists current members
of SPAC.
During 1981, SPAC completed review of all ongoing special
programs.
In addition, in 1980 and 1981, SPAC approved CMA undertaking new
special programs on arsenic, ethylene oxide, glycol ethers, ketones, poly­
chlorinated biphenyls, and zinc dialkyl dlthlophosphates.
Appendix B lists all special programs undertaken by CMA to date.
Appendix C lists companies that are currently participating in special
programs.
3.0 STAFF ORGANIZATION ASP RESPONSIBILITIES
The Special Programs Division has a staff of thirteen, including a
Director, five program administrators, a program coordinator,' five
secretaries, and one word processor*
One program administrator and one
secretary devote their time exclusively to the Fluorocarbon Program.
The
other four program administrators and four secretaries are responsible for
the remaining twenty-two programs. Figure 1 outlines the organization f
Special Programs with respect to both the staff and the specific programs.
Program administrators prepare for and attend panel and task group
meetings, prepare records of meetings, and write and administer all con­
tracts in their respective areas. In addition, program administrators:
o
maintain awareness of pertinent regulations relating to panel's
activities;
o
communicate with government agencies on scientific and regulatory
matters;
o
coordinate information flow to and from the agencies, the com­
panies, other trade associations and academic communities;
o
coordinate the development of advocacy and regulatory position
2
CMA 037764
I
papers with appropriate CMA staff, standing committees, aad
outsIda consultants; and,
o
provide.monitoring and auditing services for ongoing research
projects.
The Special Programs Division keeps the office of General Counsel
informed of the status of ongoing panel activities*
BUDGET
To date CMA program panels have spent $20,430,287 in research and
advocacy programs on 24 families of chemicals (see Table 1).
Overhead Reimbursement Budget
CMA charges participating companies the full costs, including
overhead, for administration of special programs* The program account
is charged $300 per day for professional staff. This charge includes
both the direct and allocated costs of full time professional and
clerical Special Programs staff and routine professional or support
assistance from the Technical, Legal, Government Relations, Communica­
tions, and Administrative Services Departments.
Other direct costs, such as out-of-town travel, meeting room and
program equipment rentals when meeting outside CMA, conference calls,
telex, unusually large printing and mailings, etc., are charged as
miscellaneous administrative expenses to the program.
Other CMA
professional staff time, if required to work on specific or non-rou­
tine aspects of the program, is charged at the same rate as the pro­
gram administrator. In addition to an overhead reimbursement of $300
per day, the CMA Special Programs Division is credited monthly with
0.75Z of received but not expended special program funds as Interest.
Interest received on non-dlsbursed Special Program funds is used to
defray administrative costs not recovered by the dally race.
In the
case of the fluorocarbon program, the unexpended funds balance is
approximately $2 million. This has resulted in a special agreement
with the Program Panel to credit its funds with interest at 9Z and
charge a fixed fee of $16,300 per month from June 1981 to May 1982.
This arrangement produces an effective billing rate of $825 per day
Instead of the normal $500 per day. The fixed fee of $16,500 will be
reviewed in March 1982 for fiscal year 1982-1983.
Panel Research/Advocacy Budget
CMA requires written commitment for the full amount of a
study budget from all participating companies before executing
study eontrsct(s). A separate account is established to receive
and disburse funds for each program.
3
CMA 037765
As a matter of CMA fiscal policy, participating companlas
are invoiced for a minimum of 502 of the projected fiscal year
commitments. Initial invoicing occurs immediately after partici­
pating company management approval of the program activities.
During the course of the program, additional collections are made
as necessary to maintain a reserve from which disbursements are
made. Reserves are maintained as low as possible under sound
financial management.
A new phase of a program begins whenever there is a change
in compoeltlon of sponsoring companies. At the completion of any
phase of a program, uncommitted funds are carried over to a sub­
sequent phase. If a company voluntarily drops out of a program
at the completion of all contracted work, a refund is made if the
pro-rated balance of uncommitted funds exceeds $2,500 for that
company. A company which voluntarily drops out of a program
during an ongoing study is expected to provide its full financial
commitment to the current study phase including any additions or
extensions which were approved during the term of its participa­
tion.
A financial statement detailing all expenses and commitments
is prepared monthly for each program. A copy of the statement is
provided to panel members at their meetings to keep them informed
of the financial status of the panel.
GOALS FOR 1981 - 1982
o to continue working on establishing new coatacts within
regulatory agencies;
o to establish batter communication with both U.S. and noh-D.S.
trade associations involved in activities related to Special
Programs;
o to enhance the scientific credibility of CMA by promoting the
publication of CMA-admlnlstarad research in peer review
journals;
o to achieve better recognition of CMA's eapabllltres by initi­
ating the Special Programs News Letter starting January
o to establish semi-annual meetings with representatives of other
trade associations Involved in administration of toxicologic
and epidemiologic research.

CMA 037766
LONG-RANGE PLAN
Through much hard work ou Che pare of CMA staff and panel members',
CMA-adminiseered research Is developing a reputation for Its objectivity
and Integrity. However, there Is room for Improvement.
Special Programs
needs to increase the chemical industry's awareness that Special Programs
has the expertise to:
o administer research and advocacy programs; and,
o provide scientific services which, until recently, have not been
available, expected, or requested.
To accomplish this. Special programs has identified steps which, should
be taken over the next few years. These Include:
o reducing the work load per program administrator to enable him/her
to undertake the challenge of new casks/programs;
o encouraging staff, through educational benefits, to expand existing
and develop new expertise in science and business management;
o hiring new staff to complement existing staff in scientific
disciplines not already adequately covered;
o hiring additional support staff capable of assuming a portion of a
program- administrators non-scientlflc administrative duties in order
to permit the program administrator to devote more time to
scientific and liaison functions;
o playing a larger role in penetrating the Washington scene and
interacting with regulatory agencies and professional societies by
establishing good professional relationships with peers In the
regulatory agencies, the Industry, and government-funded research
laboratories;
o utilizing the contacts and experience of individual program
administrators more effectively within the Special Programs Division
and ocher Divisions of CMA;
o completely reevaluating the method of compensating CMA for services
provided;
o developing the flexibility to provide services panels expect and for
which they are willing to pay; and,
o publicizing Special Programs accomplistazents and capabilities in:

MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS
7.1 Chlorobenzenes
Panel toxicologists provided eechnlcal input to the Chloro­
benzenes Producers Association (CPA) for their submission to EPA
in response to EPA's proposed TSCA Section 4(a) Test Rule on
Chlorobenzenes. This group of panel toxicologists has continued
to work closely with the CPA in the development of a voluntary
industry testing program that wjuld be acceptable by EPA in lieu
of formal test rule.
Following earlier dialogues between CMA/CPA and SPA a
‘’decision-tree'* approach to tasting of commercial chlorobenzenes
was adopted. The outline for this proposal is now being reviewed
by EPA. The testing program as now envisioned would be much more
conservative in scope than that originally outlined by EPA in
their proposed Test Rule.
7.2 Ethylene Oxide
The EO council Is organized In such a way that it is able to
respond immediately to emergency situations. A petition to OSHA
to issue an emergency temporary standard of 1 ppm was submitted
on August 13. 1981. Within two weeks the Council, working on
advice from its regulatory and scientific committees and outside
counsel, prepared a precise, detailed response which they sub­
mitted during a meeting with OSHA on September 2.
This meeting
was also attended by the American Hospital Association and the
Veterans Administration-both of which were anxious to join with
the Council to present a united Industry position. On September
29 OSHA denied the petition.
Fluorocarbons
o
The Program has made substantial contributions to the scien­
tific understanding of what is happening la the stratosphere.
The calculated ozone depletion at steady state (approximately
100 years from now) has fluctuated between 5Z and more chan
20Z. Current calculations indicate 6Z.
o
The Program has achieved a reputation for scientific objec­
tivity and integrity seldom attributed to industry-sponsored
effort.
o
There has been cooperation with government agencies through­
out the world and with international agencies. Research con­
ducted by government agencies has been funded or co-funded
and research with universities or private laboratories has
been co-funded with government support.
o
CMA is the only member of the Coordinating Committee on the
Ozone Layer of the United Nations Environment Program not
6
CMA 037768

representing a aacioaal government or aa Inceraatlonal
agency.
o
Perhaps che greacest coatritauclon has been Che Influence on
Che government funded stratospheric research, particularly In
che U.S. The productivity of government agency research has
been Improved substantially over Che past five years. At
least In part this has been due to the methodology followed
and advocated by the Industry-sponsored program and the
oversight and review provided by the Fluorocarbon Program
Panel.
7.4 Phthalate Esters
o
The Phthalate Esters Program Panel has developed a voluntary
test Program to address potential health and environmental
effects of a class of compounds.
o
The panel has worked with che Test Rules Development Branch
(TRDB) of che Environmental Protection Agency and has gained
their acceptance of the test program.
TRDB is currently
proceeding with agency review of the program and we expect
official acceptance by mid-November.
o
The Panel Is optimistic that EPA will decide that the data do
not warrant a 4(f) finding at this time*
o
The FDA Task Group has developed a voluntary cast program for
DEHA which is aimed at determining che cause of the bioassay
results. This program will be presented to FDA with the hope
chat che FDA will accept the program in lieu of an Interim
regulation or ban on DEHA.
o
The FDA Task Group has successfully altered che elme table
within th# Bureau of Foods for regulatory action on DEHA.
This delay has allowed FDA and CMA scientists to discuss the
scientific issues to develop mutually acceptable regulatory
actions to assure public safety and che continued use of an
unreplaceable substance, DEHA, In food contact applications.
7.5 Polychlorinated Biphenyls
There has been a spirit of mutual cooperation between CMA
and EPA since che beginning of this program. EPA representatives
worked with CMA in developing our surveys and presenting a sym­
posium on these surveys to Industry and other trade association
representatives.
o
CMA obtained the cooperation of almost SOX of Its membership
in the 50 ppm Incidental generation survey.
7
CMA 037769
o
CMA has continued co maintain on opsa dialogue with ochar
crada associations involved la collactlag data for EPA—
especially tha National Electrical Manufacturers Association
and tha Edison Electric Institute.
o
CMA submitted to EPA a narrative dissertation on tha problems
and costs associated with low level PCB analysis.
This
report was well accepted by the Agency and received good
coverage in several trade publications.
o
In order to insure the objectivity of the data generated by
its current round robin, CMA secured the participation of
several EPA laboratories in addition to member company labs.
It is hoped that the data generated from this cooperative
effort will demonstrate to EPA the variability of analytical
results which must be considered la writing and enforcing a
regulatory cut off level for' PCBa.
SUMMARIES
Special Program Advisory Committee
The Special Program Advisory Committee (SPAC) was formed to
provide the Program Panels with multi-disciplinary expertise in
areas of scientific research and governmental advocacy.
SPAC
reviews each special program on an annual, basis and once a year
reports to the CMA Executive Committee on the progress f each
program*
Controversies which exist either within a panel or between
staff and panels which cannot be resolved at staff level, are
brought to SPAC for review and recommendation. SPAC reviews all
new and revised programs for consistency with Association
policy.
Acrylonitrile (AN)
The Arerylonltrlle Program is concerned with the
epidemiology, toxicology, and environmental aspects of processes
involving acrylonitrile, its copolymers and its end products.
The program was begun in 1974 to develop additional data on the
toxicology of AN. This was accomplished through animal exposure
studies by inhalation and ingestion.
An epidemiology study was not conducted because of lack of
specific exposure data for most of the period to be studied as
well as difficulties associated wlch designating a suitable
control group. Several participating companies conducted their
own internal epidemiology studies, three of which have been
published in detail.
8
CMA 037770
FDA has been interested la food-contact applications of AN
polymers, «specially beverage bocclas.
However, cha Panal did
aoc assume an advocacy position on this Issue.
The Society of
Plastics Industry conducted advocacy related- to OSHA regulations
on AN, but CMA was not Involved.
As a result of proposed regulations by EPA In 1980, the
monomer and polymer producers decided to charter a new
organization under SOCMA to fulfill the necessary advocacy role.
This new group will also perform any future research on
Acrylonitrile. The CMA panel voted to disband upon completion of
Its current research.
Allyl Chloride
Concern over the carcinogenic hazard attributed to vinyl
chloride prompted the formation of the AC Program Panel in Jan­
uary, 1976. The panel has so far undertaken three research pro­
jects: a teratology study, a pharmacokinetic and metabolic study
and a 90-day inhalation probe study.
The need for additional
research will be determined after the results of these studies
are evaluated.
An Arsenic Program Panel was established In the first quar­
ter of 1981. The panel's objectives are to:
1) gather Informa­
tion; 2) conduct necessary research to compliment existing infor­
mation; 3) educate regulators; and 4) undertake regulatory advo­
cacy.
The panel's first priority was to sponsor an arsenic symposlias and an in-depth critical literature review on the health
effects associated with arsenic.
The symposium, scheduled for.
November 4-6 in Gaithersburg, Md. is being cosponsored with the
National Bureau of Standards. Session topics include Industrial
sources and uses of arsenic, biomedical and environmental per­
spectives, and epidemiology*
The literature review is underway
November 1981. The penel may Initiate
needs identified in this review and
regarding present and proposed arsenic
and should be completed in
research studies based on
may undertake advocacy
standards.
The Benzene Program Panel was formed In November 1976*
The
Panel assessed the data used by NIOSH and OSHA in proposing work­
place standards for benzene, developed its own recommendations,
and gathered additional data to substantiate establishment of a
standard.
9
CMA 037771
Th« panel continues co b« concerned with expansion of the
toxicological and epidemiological data bast, development of
industry guidelines for workplace standards, and health and
safety aspects of EPA's proposed National Emission Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESBAP).
The panel completed a benzene reproduction study which
showed no compound-related adverse effects in male and female
rats exposed to levels up to 3Ox the present workplace standard.
CMA and the American Petroleum Institute have initiated an
extensive 90-day Inhalation study of benzene toxicity in rats and
mice which will be used to set dose levels for a subsequent
two-year chronic benzene study.
An epidemiology study of
approximately 14,000 workers in nine plants should be completed
in 1982*
Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT)
The BHT Panel was formed in response to a proposed interim
regulation Issued by the FDA in Hay, 1977. The panel's goal is
to collect toxicological information on BHT and to recommend
research to fill any data gaps which might exist.
An Agency Proposal Pending was published on December 31,.
1979, but the final rule is still not out. The panel expects FDA
to recommend that only a 90-day subchronic study be undertaken.
The panel is waiting for U.S. government action before caking
further action on BHT.
The French government recently began phasing out BHT as a
direct food additive and is at present reviewing the use of BHT
as an indirect additive. The joint FAO/WRO Expert Committee on
Food Additives recently extended the temporary Average Dally
Intake (ADI) for BHT, pending receipt of additional testing
data.
Chlorobenzenes (CB)
The Chlorobenzenes Program Panel began its program in 1974
with the conduct of a worldwide literature search on available
health data regarding monochlorobenzene (MCB), ortho-dichl robenzene (ODCB) and para-dlchloro benzene (PDCB).
Since that
time, the panel has been concerned with expanding the toxico­
logical data base on these three compounds and has recently added
a fourth (1,2,4-trlchlorobenzane) to a proposed test program.
In October 1980, the panel initiated a series of teratology
studies on MCB, ODCB and PDCB in rats and rabbits. To clarify
results obtained in the MCB study in rabbits, a follow-up study
was conducted in this species. A draft final report on both MCB
studies is expected by the end of the year. The ODCB research was
completed and interim data are being assembled; animals go on
test in the PDCB teratology study in November 1981.
10
CMA 037772
The panel has worked closely vlch Che Chlorobenzenes
Producers Association (CPA) In formulating comments on EPA's
proposed rules for testing of chlorobenzenes under TSCA Section
4(a). The CPA has held a series of discussions with EPA in an
effort to develop a voluntary industry-sponsored testing program
in lieu of a formal test rule. A proposal outline was developed
and submitted to the Agency. If approved, the CPA has asked the
panel to provide funding and administration for the program.
Epoxy Resin (ER)
The Special Program on Epoxy Resins was approved in July,
1977. The panel was formed to evaluate the available health
effects literature on Epoxy Resins and to sponsor necessary
research.
Initially, the panel decided to concentrate on
Blsphenol-A eplchlorohydrin-derlved epoxy resins.
10
The panel is initiating an advocacy role by requesting that
OSHA remove Blsphenol A diglycIdyl ether from OSHA's candidate
carcinogen list.
Ethylene Dibromide (BOB)
Concerned about possible government regulatory action, the
panel was formed in 1979.
On December 14, 1977, EPA Issued a
Notice of Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration (RPAR).
The agency concluded that presumptions for oncogenicity, muta­
genicity and reproductive disorders had not been rebutted.
A subchronic Inhalation study conducted by Dow Chemical
Toxicology Research Laboratory showed that repeated subchronle
exposure of rats to 10 or 40 ppm of EDB induced pathologic
changes in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinate.
Subsequent post-expoeure phase revealed a lack of progression of
the lesions, with almost complete reversion toward normal
histologic appearance of the nasal turbinate.
Two additional studies were conducted by the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) and the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH). The panel conducted third-party
auditing of both of these studies. The Independent auditor found
chat both studies were of acceptable quality and their findings
valid. Since EDB wee shown to be carcinogenic in both studies,
there is no need for either continued research or an advocacy
program. The panel therefore decided to disband.
However, the
panel has been reactivated as a result of the National Brother­
hood of Teamsters' petition to OSHA to lower the current worker
exposure standard from 20,000 ppb to 15 ppb.

ary, 1975 Co evaluate cha adequacy of knowledge relating to EDO.
The panel Initiated a chronic Inhalation, a metabolic, and a
teratogenic study la experimental animals. The Panel decided to
disband, pending the acceptance of all final reports on this
research. This decision was reversed when it was learned chat
EPA was considering proposing a TSCA Section 8(a) rule.
8.11 Ethylene Oxide (EO)
A study conducted at Bushy-Run labs showed Ethylene Oxide to
be carcinogenic In rats. Industry was Interested In gathering
information on the safe handling of Ethylene Oxide which led to
the formation of the Ethylene Oxide Industry Council on July 30,
1981. The Council operates through an Executive Committee and
four operating committees: Scientific, Regulatory, Finance and
Membership, and Communications.
The Council Is developing information regarding responsible
industry programs to: 1) control exposure to ethylene oxide; 2)
to develop relevant scientific, technological and economic data;
and, 3) to cooperate with other national and international organ­
izations having similar objectives.
The Council.will present
this Information and data to any United States federal, state or
municipal governmental body considering regulatory controls o
ethylene oxide so as to assure that such standards, regulations
or policies, are reasonable, scientifically sound, and economi­
cally and socially effective.
The Council developed a response to the petition filed by
the Public Citizen Health Research Group and the American Fed­
eration of State, County and Municipal Employees to lower the
exposure standard for ethylene oxide.
The petition asked that
the eight hour TWA be lowered from 50 ppm to 1 ppm and that a
short-term exposure level of 5 ppm be established. Representa­
tives of the Council mat with OSSA officials on September 2 to
discuss Industry's eoacern regarding the petition. On September
29 OSHA denied the petition.
8.12 Fluorocarbons (FC)
The Fluorocarbon Program was formally organized in the
Spring of 1973 with essentially all of the Free World producers
of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) supporting the effort. The panel's
initial purpose was to determine the fate of CFCs in the atmos­
phere and the effects they may produce on plants or animals.
There was no suspicion of their effect on the stratosphere.
With the publication of the Ozone Depletion Theory in June,
1974 che Program was expanded end accelerated.
To date, over
$10,000,000 has been spent oa this research. There is no indica­
tion that the participants intend to curtail this effort in the
immediate future.

CMA 037774
The panel lialcs Its funding to scientific research end Its
advocacy to dlsseainatlon of research results and interpretation
of the state of the science. Legislative and regulatory advocacy
Is handled by a coalition of CFC producers and users, the Alli­
ance for Responsible C?C Policy. The Alliance depends on the
Fluorocarbon Prograa Panel for scientific data,
8.13 Glycol Ethers (Gg)
The Glycol Ethers Prograa was foraed on June 26, 1980 and is
concerned prlaarlly with the alkyl and dialkyl ethers of ethylene
glycol and dlethylene glycol, selected ethers of propylene
glycol, and their acetic acid esters.
The panel conducted a
review and evaluation of the published and available unpublished
literature on health and envlronaantal effects.
As a result of
the literature review the panel has developed a multi-phase
testing prograa. This prograa Includes testing of:
Ethylene
Glycol Monooethyl Ether (EM), Ethylene Glycol Monobutyl Ether
(EB), and Ethylene Glycol Mbnoethyl Ether (EE) in 1981 (Phase I)
for teratology and possible reproductive effects. Phase IX will
begin in 1982 and Includes teratology studies on:
Ethylene
Glycol Monoethyl Ether Acetate (EE Acetate) and Propylene Glycol
Monooethyl Ether (PM). Phase II also includes a subchronlc study
of EE and a research study still under development, which will
allow a comparative assessment of glycol ethers with their
acetates. A Phase II testing prograa on other glycol ethers may
be developed in 1982.
The Glycol Ethers Program Panel currently is considering
developing exposure data and has begun a liaison prograa with
NPCA and CSMA. The panel is also considering what role, if any,
they wish to play In an advocacy prograa with EPA and/or OSHA.
Currant advocacy activities involve interactions with NIQSH,
ACGIH, and ECETOC.
In 1979 five ketones, aethyl ethyl ketone (MEK), methyl
isobutyl ketone (MIBK), mesityl oxide (MO), isophorone and
cyclohexanone, were recommended for testing under Section 4(e) of
TSCA by the Interagency Testing Committee. The Ketones Panel met
for the first time on January 23, 1980. Their first activity was
to assemble all toxicology literature on eight ketones, including
the five on the ITC List. Both published and unpublished (from
the files of participating companies) studies were reviewed and
principal areas of deficiencies in toxicology information identi­
fied. Since the Industrial Health Foundation (IHF) already had a
program on cyclohexanone, the present scope of the Ketones Panel
is limited to the four remaining ketones on the ITC List.
A revised EPA schedule resulted from a ruling in favor of
the Natural Resources Defense Council which had sued EPA for
13
non-compliance under Saecloa 4 by aot having initiated rulemaking vichin cha one year deadline. The suit resulted in dead­
lines of 1982 for cyclohexanone and 1983 for the remaining four
ketones. Further rescheduling resulted In deadlines in aid-1982
for all five ketones.
The panel is currently undertaking an
advocacy program on four of the ketones on the ITC List: MEK,
MIBK, MO and lsophorone. The program involves developing use and
exposure information, as well as a voluntary test program.
A 9(Way inhalation study on methyl isobutyl ketone (MX3K)
is currently underway and reproduction and teratology studies are
under consideration. The panel will follow closely complimentary
testing on methyl ethyl ketone by CUT, and methyl isoamyl ketone
by Eastman Kodak. The panel has met once with EPA on testing
recommendations for ketones under Section 4(a) and is developing
a document for submission to the Agency.
The document will
present summaries of toxicity data on the four ketones and use
and exposure information. An overview of the research program
will also be included.
The Phosgene Panel was formed in April, 1975.
Its purpose
is to maximize safety in the production and use of phosgene, to
reduce the possibility of exposure incidents, and to d vel p
effective diagnostic procedures and therapeutic countermeasures.
The panel is studying means for monitoring concentrations of
phosgene in air, means of evaluating actual exposures to phosgene
as a guide to medical treatment, and means of preventing
incidents of phosgene release. Toward this objective, the panel
has funded:
o two animal studies and published two papers in the Archives
of Environmental Health (These studies suggested possible
mechanisms of Phosgene poisoning and candidate therapeutic
o a worldwide literature search; and,
o a third animal study directed toward exposure of candidate
therapeutic agents expected to be effective based on the
literature search or on results from the first two animal
research projects.
In order to improve engineering and safety practices during
the manufacturing or use of phosgene, the panel is structuring
and conducting four surveys to identify and update this informa­
tion. Dupont and Dow have each conducted in-house retrospective
epidemiology studies on workers exposed to phosgene.
The panel
does not currently find it feasible to sponsor a prospective
study due to the absence of a controlled, phosgene-only exposure.

To improve worker safety, che panel Is writing with instru­
ment designers and manufacturers to develop instrumentation with
maximum sensitivity for both industrial (process) and personal
monitoring, develop protective clothing, and self contained
breathing devices. The panel is also exploring improved in-plant
safety practices and developing optimal post-exposure diagnostic
procedures and therapeutic countermeasures.
8.16 Phthalate Eaters (PS)
The CMA Phthalate Esters Program Panel, which was formed in
1972, originally concentrated its efforts on studying the
environmental effects of phthalates.
Extensive literature
surveys at that time Indicated little or no concern over the
health effaets of phthalates* The Interagency Testing Committee
recommended only environmental testing on the phthalate ester
class of compounds. Under che provisions of Section 4 of the
Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), EPA could develop test rules
for environmental testing; however, the phthalate esters panel
began development of a comprehensive voluntary environmental
effects test program.
As a result of a 1980 draft report from the NCI to the
National Toxicology Program which shows that dl-2-ethylhexyl
phthalate (DEHP; also widely known as DOP) causes hepatocellular
carcinoma at high dose levels in laboratory rodents, phthalate
esters received increased attention from regulatory agencies.
With che disclosure of the new NTP findings, che Program Panel
expanded its efforts to Include a comprehensive testing program
to address che human health concerns. The goal was to develop a
comprehensive voluntary test program that would develop test data
required under Section 4 of TSCA, but without the imposition of
mandatory test rules.
The first phase of the comprehensive environmental effects
and human health effects testing program is ready to be imple­
mented. The human health effects portion has been designed to
examine a limited number of compounds on a risk assessment basis.
The studies which comprise this phase of the program will gener­
ate sound scientific data chat can be applicable to phthalate
esters as a class, rather than to specific chemicals. Allocation
of costs, was developed to include all the affected Industries,
phthalate producers, raw materials suppliers and phthalate users.
The environmental effects testing portion. Includes the 14
phthalate esters produced in large volume. The program Includes
acute testing for all 14 phthalates in three species. Additional
acuta and chronic cast data will be developed for those esters
for which test data is not already available. The Phthalate
Esters Panel has held several discussions with Mr. Newburg-Rlnn
of EPA's Test Rules Development Breach.
As a result of these
discussions, EPA held a public meeting on September 15, 1981 to
propose acceptance of the Panel's 7oluncary Test Program.
Final
15
CMA 037777
acceptance awaits receipt of written comments from the public and
soma further review within the Agency.
In a response to a Citizen's petition filed under Section 21
of TSCA, the EPA Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances con­
ducted a priority review assessment of DEHP which could result In
a 4(f) Action being taken by the Agency.
The CMA phthalate
Esters Panel is currently working with EPA on this issue.
Phthalate and adipate esters are also of Interest t
three
Bureaus within the FDA, the Bureau of Foods, the Bureau of
Biologies and the Bureau of Medical Devices.
The Bureau of
Biologies and the Bureau of Medical Devices are primarily
Interested In DEHP use In flexible plastics that come In contact
with blood, blood elements or Intravenous solutions.
The Bureau of Foods regulates DEHA for use in plastics chat
come la contact with foods, and DEHP for use in plastics that
contact non-fatty foods. In addition, other adipates, di-(C7,
Cg-alkyl) adipate and dl-n-alkyl adipate (made from Cg, Cg, C^q
alcohols) are sanctioned for use In foods, but foods, but the
sanctions on these latter compounds were based upon saf ty of
DEHA.
In June 1981, a new Task Group (FDATG) was formed within the
Phthalate Ester Panel, to interact with FDA on Issues relating to
adipates and phthalates. At that time the Bureau of Foods was
preparing a strategy document for submission to the FDA commis­
sioner which could have resulted in a restriction or ban of DEHA
In food contact applications.
The Phthalate Esters FDATG met
with representatives of the FDA and successfully delay d the
strategy document* The FDATG is currently preparing a detailed
review of DEHA toxicity data and developing a voluntary testing
program which FDA could accept in lieu of an Interim regulation
or ban on DEHA. Since the Phthalate Esters Panel was originally
organized and funded to address EPA's concerns, the FDATG activi­
ties will be funded separately.
The panel faces the challenge of presenting an industry con­
census on a class of compounds.
Individual participating com­
panies have diverse interests, but all have a common go 1—to
minimize the regulatory action on these substances by responsi­
ble, voluntary programs supported broadly.
8.17 polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBa)
The recent decision in EDF v. EPA, NO. 79-1580, set aside
two parts of EPA's regulation pertaining to PCBs.
The Court
found that EPA did not present substantial evidence to support
its determination to:
1) exclude from regulation materials
containing less chan 50 ppm PCBs and, b) define the statutorily
exempted "totally enclosed uses" as intact and non-leaking. As a

result of requescs by EPA and EDP Che Courc decided co stay its
mandate for up co eighteen months. Within this time period EPA
is to collect Information and promulgate a supportable regulation
on PCBe.
CMA staff, with advice from the Chemical Regulations
Advisory Committee (CRAC) and interested company representatives,
negotiated with EPA and EDP to gather information on the 50-ppm
incidental generation issue.
Since CRAC's budget could not
support the data-gathering efforts, Che Special Programs Division
was asked to assume responslbillcy for this project*
The first
panel meeting was held in February, L98L*
The PCB Panel is conducting two surveys of its member com­
panies: 1) 50 ppm incidental generation survey - to characterize
the nature and scope of the low concentrations of PCBs; 2) total­
ly enclosed survey - to identify the numbers of pieces of elec­
trical equipment which contain PCBs, the volume of such PCBs, and
their concentration levels or ranges. The information obtained
from these surveys will be presented to EPA. In August 1981, the
panel submitted to EPA an analytical narrative dissertation dis­
cussing the problems and costs associated with low level PCB
analysis. The panel is currently conducting an analytical roundrobin testing program which Involves both industry and EPA
laboratories.
8.18 Rubber Additives (RA?
The Rubber Additives Program Panel was formed in March 1980
to sponsor research that would expand the .toxicological data base
on rubber chemicals of interest to participating companies.
As an initial effort, the panel sponsored a series of in
vitro tests on purified and commercial samples of 2-(morphoiiaothio) benzothiazolesulfanamide (MBS). Further testing of MBS
is presently under consideration, as is the need for testing of
other rubber additives.
The panel works in close cooperation with both the WTR
(International Working Group on Rubber Chemical Toxicology) and
Che Rubber Manufacturers Association. All three groups have been
concerned with nltrosamlnes in the workplace and the panel is
considering undertaking a testing program on nitrosamlne.
The Styrene Program Panel is expanding the styrene toxicol­
ogy data base. The panel also represents the interests of its
members before federal agencies in matters relating to safety and
health Issues.
A two-year chronic and three-generation reproduction study
of styrene in drinking water was completed and released t

8.20 Titanium Dloxlda (TD)
In 1977, Du Pont Initiated a ravlaw of tha lltaratura on
titanium dloxlda toxicity and concluded that furthar Information
was naadad to answer possible questions which might be directed
at titanium dioxide. The impact of the Toxic Substances Control
Act also raised concern as to tha adequacy of existing
information.
Tha panel has tentatively concluded that a historical
mortality study is not justified at this time.
The panel plans
to terminate program activities If no new evidence f human
health effects is reported as a result of the two year inhalation
studies being conducted by Du Pont.
8.21 Trichloroethylene (TCE)
The Trichloroethylene Program Panal was formed on May 12,
1975 in response to an MCI Memorandum-of Alert.
Tha panel's
primary concern was a long-term inhalation study. A contract was
signed in 1975 with Industrial BIO-TEST Laboratories (1BT) to
conduct such a study. The testing performed by IBT resulted in a
ntmber of grave inadequacies and a final report was not issued.
Therefore, the CMA TCE Audit Task Group prepared an audit r port.
EPA's Cancer Assessment Group has asked the panel to provide
validation of chamber concentrations for the first 12 to 15
months of the IBT study.
The panel is monitoring the progress of the MCI bioassay on
TCE which Involves several strains of mice and rats.
Although the panel contemplated an epidemiological study,
SOCMA determined that a study population for an epidemiologic
Investigation would be too small to yield statistically signif­
icant results. Therefore, such a study was not conducted.
8.22 Vinyl Chloride (VC)
Since 1972, the Program Panel has supported activities
related to the accumulation and assessment of health and safety
data of vinyl chloride monomer.
18
CMA 037780
After funding several animal studies, the eaphasis on
research shifted from toxicological investigations to the early
diagnosis and clinical management of vinyl chloride-related
injuries.
The panel is also funding an update of a vinyl
chloride epidemiology study of 10,000 workers.
The panel has maintained a close liaison with SPI and
several European-based companies.
The present interest in
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) dust control limits in the UK is being
closely followed. Several months ago QSHA requested information
on PVC dust; however, no notice has been published or other
action taken.
8.23 Vlnylldene Chloride (VPC)
The Vlnylldene Chloride Program Panel was formed in May 15,
1974 to investigate the potential toxicologic effects and pharma­
cokinetics of Inhaled and ingested VDC in laboratory animals.
Dow Chemical, which was planning research on VDC toxicology,
agreed to convert its program into an industry-wide effort.
The
IWo-Year Inhalation Toxicity and Oncogenicity Study of Vlnylldene
Chloride in Rats is stll in progress.
The Work Practices Task Group of the panel prepared a Health
and Safety Work Practices Guideline for Vlnylldene Chloride to
minimise expodufe to VUU.
me uulaeiiaes wets s An C co the
Director of NIOSH and the Project Manager, for Criteria Documents
at SRI. They received no other distribution.
The panel is preparing to respond to a Health Risk Assess­
ment Criteria document on VDC under preparation by the EPA Cri­
teria and Health Assessment Group. OSHA does not have a standard
for VDC and EPA is unlikely to require any further toxicity
testing on VDC under TSCA Section 4.
The pharmacokinetics and metabolism research show a species
sensitivity of Mouse>Rat>Man.
The total data bank indicates
oncogeaicity is not observed without recurrent tissue damage and
without a cytotoxic dose; a tumorlgenic response in man would be
an improbable event.
8.24 Zinc Dialkyl Dlthiophosphates (ZDDP)
The ZDDP Program Panel was chartered in November 1980 to
conduct research on this class of oil additives.
As a first
step, gonadal toxicity studies of three ZDDP compounds were
initiated in immature and mature rats and rabbits.
Obvious species differences were observed between rabbits
and rats with respect to ZDDP toxicity. Consequently, the panel
proposes to conduct a comparative in vivo pharmacokinetic study

The Technical Director Is working actively with the Con­
servation Foundation to develop a hazardous waste siting book­
let for use In local communities.
She also participated as a
member on the Coast Guard's Chemical Transportation Advisory
Committee where an International Superfund was discussed.
(See
Environmental Programs.)
The major activities of the Technical Department -outside of those detailed In the following sections •• centered
on preparation for the Semiannual Meeting and the report for
the Technical Review Committee.
The Review will be on November
CHEMTREC
The next CHEMTREC workshop Is scheduled for Louisville
on November 18-19.
The Director and selected Advisors are
working with Texas AAM to refine their presentation.
They're
working to reduce to a minimum the outside resources required.
This program will continue through the three remaining
developmental workshops.
There are now 18 companies, with 24 stations, on the
"hard copy" network.
Approximately one-third of the total
traffic goes through this system.
The CHEMTREC Advisors met October 28-29 to discuss a
number of matters, including reporting by carriers, and
emergency response outside of the United States.
CMA 037796

A member survey Indicates that for the 12-month period
ending June 30, 1981, CMA members have improved energy
efficiency by 23.4%, compared with 1972.
ENGINEERING
CMA reviewed and commented on five standards of substan­
tial Interest to the chemical Industry.
They were proposed for
adoption as American National Standards by Underwriters Labora­
tories (UL) and Manufacturers Standardization Society.
CMA's
major concern continues to be adequate safety at reasonable
cost.
Of those reviewed, CMA reaffirmed Its negative vote on
three UL proposals because of Inadequate wire beading space,
which would result In excessive Installation and maintenance
costs.
The Committee Is planning a forum on the causes and
effects of power outages, and cures for them, with a view
towards formulating remedial action.
The Committee Is preparing and selecting a speaker for
the program for the third Process Computer Users Forum to be
held In May 1982.
This forum will build upon what was learned
last time about distributed computer control.
It will also
explore managerial considerations Including use of management
Information systems and scientific computations, and full
utilization of Installed systems.
CHEMICAL REGULATIONS
CRAC has been meeting with EPA In a series of discussions
on CMA's petition requesting exemptions from PMN requirements
for low-volume chemicals, site-limited Intermediates, and
certain polymers.
The meetings have focused on Issues raised
by EPA and data requirements that the Agency believes it needs
prior to proposed rulemaking.
Examples Include definition of a
qualified expert, criteria for polymer exemptions and justifi­
cation for a 25,000 pound cut-off for low-volume exemptions,
among others.
CRAC Intends to complete Its discussions with
EPA by the end of 1981, and looks for EPA proposed rules during
the first quarter of 1982.
CMA staff prepared an economic analysis supporting our
25,000 pound cut-off for low-volume PMN exemptions.
PMNassociated costs were shown to adversely Impact the market­
ability of new chemicals, which, in turn, reduces the
innovative capability of the chemical Industry.
CRAC representat1ves and CMA staff met with Don Clay,
Director of the Office of Toxic Substances (OTS) to discuss
major regulatory Issues under, TSCA.
Mr. Clay has assigned
CMA 037798
4
three of his staff to develop comprehensive EPA programs for
reporting, PMNs, and contract management for OTS activities.
PMN exemptions will be part of EPA's priority programs, which
gives us assurance that proposed PMN exemption rules will be
ready soon.
Staff updated the portion of CMA's submission to the Vice
President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief dealing with TSCArelated Issues.
The update detailed the progress EPA has made
In addressing the key Issues highlighted In the original
report.
CRAC held a two-day planning meeting on October 21-22 to
discuss how the current objective and key strategies of each
task group are helping to achieve the overall goals of CMA and
to promote effective regulations under TSCA.
CRAC plans to hold an Information Meeting for CMA members
on December 3.
Dr. John Todhunter (EPA) Is the Invited guest
speaker; he will speak on the Agency's plans for Implementing
TSCA.
Testing
Comments are being prepared on EPA test rules proposed
June 5, and on OECD proposed test guidelines.
The task group
Is also working on a strategy for getting closure on Section 4
Test Standards and related issues.
Reporting
Plans are being made to develop a strategy for Implement­
ing Section 8 of TSCA In a more Integrated manner.
The task
group looks forward to Interacting with EPA In this effort.
CSIN
The major effort of the task group Is planning a workshop
for early 1982 on the subject of data quality.
HAZARDS COMMUNICATIONS SPECIAL COMMITTEE
CMA submitted a draft hazards communications proposal to
OSHA on July 13, 1981.
The OSHA Work Group has reviewed CMA's
proposal and has allegedly Incorporated most of Industry's
positions In Its own draft.
As of October 3, the OSHA draft
had not been signed by Secretary Donovan.
A publication date
is, therefore, unknown.
The CMA draft proposal focuses on Material Safety Data
Sheets, worker training and education programs, and workplace
hazards communications.
It is anticipated that these same
CMA 037799
1
5
components will be incorporated into the OSHA rule, but the
final standard will most likely be a more complex proposal than
that developed by CMA.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH
Access to Records
OSHA stayed parts of the rule on access to employee
records to consider confidentiality of trade secrets.
CMA
recommended that negotiations with employee representat1ves,
not regulations, should determine the conditions for allowing
access to records with trade secrets.
Moreover, CMA continues
to Intervene In the AFL/CIO legal action to prevent further
broadening of access to employee records.
Hearing Conservation
In comments to OSHA, CMA recommended that stays be con­
tinued on the amendment to the occupational noise standard.
CMA made additional suggestions on remaining parts of the
Standard to permit continued use of hearing conservation
programs which have been so successful In.the chemical
1ndustry.
I
Informing Primary Care Physicians About Occupational
Medicine
CMA co-sponsored a pioneering course In cooperation with
the American Occupational Medical Association, to Inform
primary care physicians and other health professionals about
occupational medicine.
Attendance was good and the
presentations were well received.
Reproductive Hazards
Reproductive hazards In the workplace remain a major
chemial Industry concern.
In Its comments on the Interagency
Regulatory Liaison Group's Risk Assessment Work Plan for
control of reproductive hazards, CMA discussed the complexity
and lack of Information on this subject.
Targeting
CMA endorsed OSHA proposals for targeting Safety Inspec­
tions and made suggestions for Improvement.
These Included the
use of OSHA recordable Injuries and self-reporting of these
data to the Agency.
OSHC will continue to work with the Agency
on this matter.
PUBLIC RISK ANALYSIS SPECIAL COMMITTEE
PRASC developed a proposed- policy for regulatory Impact
analysis for health, safety and envlronmental chemical regu-
I
CMA 037800

latlons.
The proposed policy addresses all pertinent aspects
of regulatory Impact analysis of which public risk analysis Is
one component.
A CMA position on regulatory Impact analysis Is
Important because of the potential Impact of Executive Order
12291.
On September 29, CMA's Board of Directors approved the
Public Risk Analysis Special Committee's proposed policy on
regulatory Impact analysis.
At the Semiannual Meeting In November, CMA will recommend
to Its Executive Committee and Board of Directors that PRASC
sunset and a new committee be formed.
This new committee, the
Regulatory Impact Special Committee (RISC), will have a charter
and objectives more In line with the CMA policy on regulatory
Impact analysis.
Among Its several tasks, RISC will define and
develop appropriate methodologies for use In regulatory Impact
analysis by CMA.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS
Regulatory Reform
CMA sent out a letter to CMA committee chairmen, vice
chairmen, task group leaders and staff executives requesting
their assistance In providing Vice President Bush with an
Interim progress report on the accomplishments and remaining
tasks of the Administration's regulatory relief program.
Clean Air Act
Comprehensive written testimony is being prepared for sub­
mittal to Congressman Waxman's Subcommittee on Health and the
environment concerning amendment of the Clean Air Act.
The
materials submitted will cover all of CMA's positions on
amending the Clean Air Act.
A.CMA delegation participated In a meeting at EPA-Durham
to discuss the Agency's plans for regulation under Section 112
of the Clean Air Act.
On chemicals yet to be listed, EPA plans
Science Advisory Board review of the listing (several will be
reviewed In early 1982), then several option papers will be
available for the Admlnlstrator to review.
The regulatory
options Include:
regulate under Section 111(d), list
Immediately under Section 112, proceed toward listing and
regulating under Section 112.
EPA seemed willing to consider
changes In the Act Including compressing listing and standard
setting, use of “unreasonable risk" and regulating by source
categories.
Superfund
Members of the Superfund Task Group met with EPA
representat1ves to discuss EPA's new concept on the "how clean

Ing solutions be used and they would like to develop a matrix
to be used as a guidance document.
CMA Is developing recom­
mendations which will be submitted to EPA. The meeting repre­
sented significant progress In developing a workable approach
for the "how clean Is clean" Issue.
Members of CMA Environmental. Distribution, and Legal
staff met with representatives of the U.S. Coast Guard to
discuss an IMCO draft Articles for a Convention on Liability
and Compensation In Connection with the Carriage of Noxious and
Hazardous Substances by Sea.
Our review of this draft
Indicates that It appears to be an International Superfund with
all the unacceptable provisions we were able to minimize last
year. We discussed the posltlon(s) to be espoused by the U.S.
Delegation (l.e., the Coast Guard).
Speaking Engagements
Joe Mayhew attended the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Life Sciences Symposium In Gatllnburg, Tennessee on October
5-6. He gave a presentation on "The Effect of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act on Hazardous Waste Treatment and
Disposal Practices In the Chemical Industry."
J. Harvey conducted a media tour In Central Florida
October 26-28, 1981. She concentrated her remarks primarily on
the topic of hazardous wastes.
BIOMEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS
Ally! Chloride
The Ally! Chloride Program Panel has recently accepted the
draft final report by Dow Chemical of the pharmacokinetic and
metabolic properties of ally! chloride. The panel Is currently
awaiting the completion of a 90-day Inhalation study.
Arsenic
CMA and the National Bureau of Standards are sponsoring an
Arsenic Symposium to be held In Gaithersburg, MD on November
4-5, 1981. The symposium will provide a means whereby Industry
and government agencies may reach an understanding for costeffective regulation of arsenic as a hazardous material through
knowledge of production and use patterns, toxicologic proper­
ties, and the presence of arsenic In the environment.
The Arsenic Program Panel sponsored a literature review of
"he suspected carcinogenic effects of arsenic with Dr. HardlngBarlow.

Butylated Hydroxytoluene (8HT)
The joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives re­
cently extended the temporary average dally Intake (ADI) for
BHT, pending receipt of additional testing data.
Chlorobenzenes
EPA and the chlorobenzenes producers have agreed on a
decision-tree approach to the testing of chlorobenzenes In the
voluntary Industry test program. The Toxicology Research Group
has recommended that Dr. Gary Williams of the American Health
Foundation perform the cell transformation assays and EPA Is In
agreement with this recommendation. Requests for proposals to
conduct a two-generation reproduction study on monochloro­
benzene were sent to five contract laboratories.
Ethylene Dibromide (EDB)
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters urged In a
September 2, 1981. petition that the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) Issue an emergency temporary
standard (ETS) reducing the exposure limit for the fumigant
EDB. The Teamsters' petition claims that "three major studies"
show EDB to be a potent carcinogen at levels far below those
allowed under the present OSHA standard.
OSHA has been asked
to write an ETS. OSHA has no definitive plan of action until
it has obtained more data.
Information from the panel will be
considered. Dr. L. Vernon White of Great Lakes Chemical and
Mr. Roger Mangham of Ethyl Corporation will attend an OSHA
meeting on EDB on October 13 as Industry representatives.
Ethylene Dlchlorlde
The Ethylene Dlchlorlde Program Panel Is endeavoring to
clarify several questions relating to the final report of the
chronic Inhalation study conducted for the panel by Drs.
Maltonl and Spreaflco.
Ethylene Oxide
Membership of the newly formed Ethylene Oxide Industry
Council Includes 28 companies and associations. The Scientific
and Regulatory Committees have formed several task forces that
are In the process of developing programs.
Budgets and
proposals are to be submitted to the EOIC Executive Committee
by November 1.
On September 28, OSHA denied a petition of the the Public
Citizen Health Research Group and the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees to Issue an emergency
temporary standard. Also OSHA stated that an advance notice of
proposed rulemaking (ANPR) woul-d be Issued.
Included In the
CMA 037803
9
denial was a statement that regulation of sterllant and
pesticide end users of ethylene oxide would be under EPA's
jurisdiction.
It was expected that the Health Research Group would file
a motion for injunctive relief In the DC District Court;
however, this has not occurred.
On October 1, the Group did
file a discovery request with OSHA for documents used as a
basis for the denial.
FIuorocarbons
All 19 participating companies have committed to the In*
creased budget of $1.9 million for calendar year 1982.

Is no Indication that the Industry contribution to the resolu­
tion of tffe validity of the Ozone Depletion Theory will
diminish In the near future.
Four CMA representatives attended the UNEP Coordinating
Committee on the Ozone Layer at Copenhagen, Denmark, on October
Two task forces and the Fluorocarbon Program Panel (FPP*)
met In Rome, Italy the week of October 19, 1981.
A number of

EXHIBIT J
REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
WILLIAM M. STOVER
TAXATION;
THE PRESIDENT AND THE FEDERAL BUDGET
When President Reagan made his public appeal last month on new
proposals to reach his overall budget goals, he rejected delays in
any of the recently enacted individual tax reductions. Instead,
the President proposed to enact new measures to eliminate "abuses
and obsolete incentives in the tax code." These include proposals
to restrict or to repeal the use of tax exempt industrial revenue
bonds, to accelerate the quarterly payment of corporate income
taxes, to repeal business and individual energy tax credits, and to
liminate the practice of allowing certain contractors to defer income
tax payments until the last year of a multi-year contract.
In
addition, the President re-emphasized the need to enact legislation
for additional user fees on boats, barges, and private airplanes.
As anticipated, the proposed sources of new tax resources cited
by the Administration met strong opposition on Capitol Hill. Early
warning signals from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Dole
(R-Kansas) indicated that at present a majority of the Senate would
prefer to postpone the effective date of the Reagan individual tax
custs from July to October, both in 1982 and in 1983, rather than
to adopt new taxes so near an election year. On the other hand, the
House Democratic leadership for the moment appears willing to allow
pressure from the economy to build before directly confronting the
President's program.
For the moment the President's options appear to be limited in
addressing key factors that are largely beyond his control;
interest
rates, revenue flows to the Treasury, and inflation. At this writing,
the possibility of a major slowdown in economic activity appears to
have cooled investor demands for higher interest rates, at least for
the moment.
ENERGY;
NATURAL GAS
It is currently expected that when a formal Administration
position on natural gas deregulation is announced, it will include
a recommendation for accelerated phased decontrol of all natural
gas over a three year period. The present belief is that an
announcement will not be made until budget and economic policy issues
have been considered by the Congress. General principles or guide­
lines for legislation, however, may be provided to the Congress in
order to promote a hearing process this year. Congressional con­
sideration will also be influenced by the nearing of the 1982 elections.
CMA 037813
2
Oversight hearings on wellhead prices for natural gas have
been scheduled by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
for November 5 and 6. The hearings are expected to focus on
problems involved in implementing the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA)
specifically Title I. Undoubtedly discussion will also include the
broader natural gas issues, and CMA has requested an opportunity
to appear. No House hearings are expected in the near future, but
support continues to grow for the major elements of H.R. 4350,
offered by Representative Phil Gramm (D-TX-6).
The CMA position and supporting information continues to be
provided to key Administration officials and Congressional members.
The Government Relations Committee (GRC) Energy Task Group is also
preparing to offer a natural gas issues briefing to member company
Washington representatives, possibly in November. A natural gas
"white paper" that discusses the issues and chemical industry
viewpoints is being developed.
ENERGY;
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
On September 30, the Senate Energy and Natural Resourc s
Committee completed markup of legislation designed to deal with a
major petroleum shortfall. Several amendments to S.1503, the bill
introduced by Chairman James A. McClure (R-ID), were included in
the final version. The Standby Petroleum Allocation Act of 1981
(SPAA) would provide the President with broad discretionary authorii
and offer a list of options in the event of a severe petroleum
supply shortage. In many respects the reported bill is similar to
the expired Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act (EPAA). The same
priority provisions of the EPAA were added, including a provision
for petrochemicals. The bill is ready for Senate floor action and
activity could occur in late October.
Markup has been delayed' in the House Energy and Commerce Sub­
committee on Fossil and Synthetic Fuels, and probably will not be
held until sufficient support exists among Subcommittee members to
report out a bill.
CHowever, Chairman Philip R. Sharp (D-IN-10) die
introduce a bill, H.R. 4700, similar in many respects to the unamem
Senate version. The Standby Authority Petroleum Allocation Act of
1981 differs by not listing specific priority guideline provisions,
but would require adoption of regulations consistent with the
priorities specified in the old EPAA.
The Administration remains opposed to the passage of any
legislation to deal with an energy emergency. CMA, likewise, belie*
that no legislation is necessary and that free market forces can
best allocate resources.
In the event that legislation appears
imminent, the CMA effort will be to assure recognition of a high
priority for feedstocks, as in the Senate bill.
ENVIRONMENT;
CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS
The Reagan Administration is beginning to provide some of the
momentum necessary for amendment of the Clean Air Act.
CMA 037814
1
3
In late September, President Reagan reaffirmed "the Adminis­
tration's keen Interest In seeing Congress make much needed
corrections to the Clean Air Act this year", In a letter to Senate
Majority Leader Howard Baker and to House Minority Leader Robert Michel.
The President's letter described the Clean Air Act as "our top
priority in the area of regulatory reform", and changes in the Act
as " ssential to the success of our overall economic recovery
program."
Since then. Vice President Bush has begun selectively con­
tacting members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee
and the House Energy and Commerce Committee to encourage development
of bipartisan legislation in accordance with the 11 principles
announced by EFA Administrator Anne Gorsuch in early August.
Senator Robert T. Stafford (R-VT.), Chairman of the Senate Committee,
now has staff working to develop consensus and legislative language
for Committee mark-up, possibly late in October. The Committee's
new pace could be a reflection of the fact that Stafford has just
announced he is running for re-election, and thus seeks closer ties
with the Administration.
On October 13, CMA representatives met with the Senate Committee
staff to discuss recently released draft legislative language. Our
representatives emphasized our concern on the Prevention of Significant
Det rioration (PSD) proposals, but we focused primarily on the
Hazardous Air Pollutants porgram proposals (Section 112).
In the House, there has been little movement toward the drafting
of a combined mobile and stationary sources bill by
Chairman John D. Dingell (D-MI-16) and Ranking Minority Leader
James T. Broyhill (R-NC-10). Industry hopes to generate interest in
introduction of the necessary bipartisan, comprehensive legislation
following the hearings in the Subcommittee on Health and the
Environment, which are scheduled through November 9.
CMA testimony on recommended improvements regarding PSD require­
ments of the Clean Air Act will be delivered at hearings of the
Health Subcommittee scheduled for October 28. In addition, a detailed
statement on all CMA recommended revisions will be submitted for
the record.
Our Clean Air Act legislative program continues to include
active participation in a broad business coalition organized to
work for amendments this year. We helped develop the coalition's
consensus document detailing 12 basic areas of necessary change in
the Act to "make it work". We are cooperating in sharing the document
with Congressional members and staff in order to show industry unity
for prompt action.

Further, as part of our objective to generate both public
acceptance and more positive media treatment of the need to amend
the Clean Air Act, a CMA "Action Advisory" was issued on September 2$
to all member companies, urging: contact with Senators and
Representatives; education of local media, local opinion leaders and
groups; and, encouragement of others to help carry the message.
Background materials were provided and supplemental materials are
being sent in later mailings.
ENVIRONMENT:
GROUNDWATER POLICY
Rep. Toby Moffett (D-Conn.) September 10 sent a letter to
EFA Administrator Gorsuch criticizing ERA'S "lack of action" on
groundwater protection. The Moffet letter asked Gorsuch to respond
by September 30 with "all documents and materials relating to
your decision not to issue a national groundwater strategy at this
time." Moffat's main concern is that the Administration will not
continue working on a National Groundwater Policy Guidance Docum nt.
CMA testified last year in support of the development of such a
Groundwater Guidance Document.
i
In the past, Moffett has threatened to introduce federal
legislation to regulate groundwater if a National Policy was not
developed within EPA. Moffet's Subcommittee on Environment, Energy
and Natural Resources of the House Government Operations Committee,
will conduct an oversight hearing October 21, 1981 to discuss with
EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch the status of the groundwater policy <
and other issues.
ENVIRONMENT:
CLEAN WATER ACT
On September 24 the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee completed work on H.R. 4503 (Roe, D-NJ) to authorize for
one year (FY 1982) $2.4 billion for the sewage treatment construction
grants program.
It was expected that Rep. Jim Oberstar (D-MN) would
offer an amendment that would extend the 1984 date for achieving
Best Available Technology (BAT).
1
The Clean Water Act Task Group of the Government Relations
Committee, expressed the following concerns with the Oberstar
amendment:
The chemical industry needs a comprehensive review
of the Clean Water Act in 1982.
These needs go far beyond a simple extension of
BAT requirements.
While we support an extension of the 1984 BAT date,
we have a deep concern that the inclusion of such
an amendment now will preclude a comprehensive re­
view of Titles 3 and 4 next year.
Thus, unless we can be assur d that the passage of
this amendment now would not preclude a full review
of the bill next y ar, we would prefer that non­
construction grant provisions be considered earlv
next year.

The Task Group contacted key members of the Public Works
and Transportation Committee and expressed these concerns.
Subsequently, Rep. Oberstar did not offer his amendment in Committee,
but the construction grants bill, H.R. 4503, could be brought to
the House floor by the end of October, and Mr. Oberstar is considering
offering his amendment at that time. The Task Group will be expressing
the chemical industry's concerns with the timing of the Oberstar
amendment with key members of the House, and stressing the need for
a comprehensive review of the Clean Water Act in 1982.
On September 23, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committe
completed its work on the construction grants bill, S. 1274. During
the session the Committee voted unanimously to repeal the Industrial
Cost Exclusion provision (the so-called Stafford Amendment). CMA
submitted a letter supporting the repeal of ICE to all members of
the Environment and Public Works Committee.
ENVIRONMENT:
SUPERFUND DEVELOPMENTS
CMA has been granted the right to intervene in the New Jersey
Attorney General's lawsuit on pre-emption against the Federal
Government. Judge Flannery of the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia will now hear the Federal Government's motion
to dismiss the case.
EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch has recommended to 0MB that the
Army Corps of Engineers be used to assist in the cleanup of
hazardous waste dumpsites under Superfund, Rep. James Florio (D-NJ)
became concerned about the use of the Corps for cleanup and asked
CMA for its views.
In a letter to 0MB's David Stockman dated
September 15, CMA strongly supported the use of private contractors
in the design and construction work required under Superfund. CMA
said the Corps presently does not have the experience*or trained
personnel that will be necessary to conduct the remedial cleanup
program called for in Superfund.
Rep. Florio held an oversight hearing on the Superfund law
July 29, before his Subcommittee on Commerce, Transportation and
Tourism of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. During the
hearing, Florio developed a discussion on joint and several liability
with EPA's Gorsuch and Department of Justice's Carol Dinkins that
appeared to confuse the issues. CMA therefore felt it necessary
to submit for the hearing record a legal memorandum on joint and
several liability. We contend that the failure of Congress to pro­
vide joint and several liability was intentional. The CMA views
were then critized by Senator Robert Stafford (R-VT) in the Congres­
sional Record of September 9.
CMA 037817

TAXATION;
SUPERFUND TAXES
CMA has learned that a draft of proposed interpretative
regulations on the application of the excise taxes imposed on
chemicals and petroleum under the Superfund legislation is being
reviewed within the Internal Revenue Service. We anticipate that
the proposed regulations will be moving forward from the IRS to
the Treasury Department within the next few weeks.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE;
EXPORT,OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES
President Reagan requested from his Secretaries of State and
Commerce on February 17, 1981 proposals for changes in existing
notification systems for exports of "hazardous” substances. A
large proportion of pesticide exports would be most affected along
with products eventually to be restricted under TSCA. The Reagan
Administration has dropped any plans for control or prohibition of
such exports as provided for in President Carter's executive order
which President Reagan subsequently revoked.
Since February, the Commerce and State Departments have en­
countered disagreements in writing the joint response. The most
serious difference of opinion is through what channels information
is to be passed from the U.S. exporter to the country receiving the
product*.* The most likely choice at this writing appears to be the.
U.S. embassy of the receiving country. Another issue in the joint,
response will be whether recommendations are made to amend appro- t
priate sections of existing FIFRA and TSCA laws. The CMA position)
that TSCA should not be amended for this purpose has been strongly?
emphasized by our spokesmen.
The CMA has worked closely with government officials during
this process of evaluation. Close liaison with -the National
Agricultural Chemicals Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufac­
turers Association has been maintained and a fully coordinated
position maintained.
It is expected that we will be allowed to
comment on the final draft before it is approved by an interagency^
committee.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE;
NORTH AMERICAN TRADE POLICY
The Administration continues to take initiatives toward new
trade arrangements with Mexico and Canada. Tensions with Canada ;
over its National Energy Flan and the Federal Investment Review Act
and with Mexico on a number of issues have served to heighten the '
activity.
The President made a report to Congress on a North American t»
union on July 26. His visits with Mexican President Lopez Portillo
and Canadian Prime Minister Trud au have been only preliminaries but
they have triggered follow-up activities. A joint U. 5./Mexico
CMA 037818
i
7
Commission of top level officials has been formed and met recently.
Evidence grows that Mexico and Canada are seeking duty free access
to the U.S. petrochemical market. The Administration has stated
that it wishes to free up markets and trade flows. It is likely
that petrochemical agreements will eventually be made. U.S.
chemical exports to Canada in 1980 were $2.1 billion and to Mexico,
$1.4 billion. These totalled 17 percent of all U.S. chemical exports.
CMA is maintaining close liaison with a Senate Caucus and a
U.S. Chamber of Commerce group working on this matter. A letter has
been sent to U.S. Trade Representative Brock by Mr. Leo Johnstone,
Phillips Petroleum Company. The letter emphasizes the chemical
industry stake in a trade arrangement, and requests that the industry
b kept informed of developments affecting chemicals in the hope that
th industry will be able to support whatever agreement is made.
Various pieces of legislation in the Congress dealing with
Canadian government policy have been introduced but are not likely
to see significant action soon.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE;
SEMINAR PLANNED
On December 8 and 9, the International Trade Committee will
hold a trade seminar at the Marriott Hotel, 22nd and M Streets,
Washington, D.C. Milt Hunt, Chairman of the ITC, will preside.
Subjects of interest to chemical companies will be covered thoroughly
by highly qualified speakers from the Congress and agencies.
Featured will be an introductory overview by Leo Johnstone, Executive
Vic President - Phillips Petroleum Company. Ambassador Sill Brock
will speak at a dinner December 8.
Brochures with details and a registration form will be widely
distributed on October 23.
SAFETY AND HEALTH;
TSCA REAUTHORIZATION
On September 29 the House approved H.R. 3495, the Energy and
Commerce Committee bill to reauthorize TSCA for two years at a
funding level of $62 million (plus $1.5 million for state programs).
S. 1211, passed by the Senate last May, would reauthorize TSCA for
one year at $59.6 million. A Conference is expected to resolve the
differences shortly.
Following our work with key House members and staff to avoid
counter-productive amendments to TSCA earlier this year, CMA
continues to respond to Congressman Florio's staff in their efforts
to monitor the Reagan Administration's implementation of TSCA generally.
Mr. Florio still plans to call for an Office of Technology Assessment

study of the adequacy of the PMN test data, although the letter
formally requesting OTA to begin work has not been sent.
In the
meantime, CMA is working with EPA to produce a viable PMN exemption:
policy for new, low risk chemicals under section 12(b) of TSCA,
as well as the negotiations between the U.S. and OECD, regarding
a decision on minimum premarket data, and the interpretive not
language to remedy chemical industry concerns.
SAFETY AND HEALTH:
OSHA REFORM
On September 23 Senator Paula Hawkins' (R-Fla.) Oversight and
Investigations Subcommittee began long awaited hearings on OSHA
oversight, focused broadly on the Agency's administration of the Act
and recommendations for the future. Thorne Auchter was commended
for his efforts to re-direct the Agency away from its previous
adversarial approach. Senator Kennedy, as expected, was critical oi
what he perceived to be an "emasculation" of worker protections
under the Act. He tried to embarrass Mr. Auchter for media effect,
but on the whole, Auchtdr stood up well to the questioning and made
an effective presentation.
The Reagan Administration will not be moving toward legislative
change in this area until other priorities are handled and there
has been an opportunity to determine which administrative reforms
have demonstrated success. CMA is working closely with the new
leadership at OSHA, and with a broad based industry coalition, for
the purpose of developing recommendations for OSHA reform at the
appropriate time.
SAFETY AND HEALTH;
HAZARDS COMMUNICATIONS/LABELING
On October €, Congressman Gaydos* Health and Safety Subcommittc
continued its hearings on OSHA's withdrawal of its proposed hazards
communications standard, receiving testimony from Master Chemical
Company. Master testified against the original proposed OSHA stands
from a small chemical company standpoint, providing detail as to ho*
disclosure of specific chemical identity could harm its busin ss.
The next hearings have been scheduled for November 3, at which OSHA!
Thorne Auchter will testify on labeling as well as other matters
within the framework of OSHA oversight.
CMA continues to provide follow-up information to the Subcoramit
and to work with Subcommittee members responsive to industry positio
Simultaneously, CMA has sought to assist the new task force at OSHA
in development of a new performance-oriented, cost effective and
reasonable hazards communications standard.
SAFETY AND HEALTH;
HOUSE HEARING ON THE RITTER RISK ANALYSIS BILL
On September 24 the House Sci nee Subcommittee on Res arch and.
Technology, chaired by Doug Walgren (D-Pa.), held a hearing on
CMA 037820
9
Congressman Don Ritter's (R-Pa.) Risk Analysis Research and
Demonstration Act of 1981 (H.R. 3441) . This bill calls for
development of comparative risk analysis methodology in a research
and demonstration program under the direction of the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy. It would authorize
$1.7 million for a two-year government R & D program to improve
risk analysis techniques in regulatory decisionmaking, and a twoyear risk analysis study by regulatory agencies and the National
Science Foundation.
Testifying in favor of the bill were Congressman Jim Martin
(R-NC), Congressman Ritter, Attorney Michael Baram, and Brookings'
Dr. Lester Lave. Dr. James Miller, then Executive Director of the
White House Task Force on Regulatory Relief, testified on behalf of
the Administration. Dr. Miller agreed with the goals and concepts of
the legislation, but could not give it his official support. In
his view, H.R. 3441's goals could be achieved through existing
mechanisms within OMB (i.e., the Task Force on Regulatory Relief)
without additional appropriations.
TRANSPORTATION:
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
The differing Senate and House bills that reauthorize and
amend the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act are awaiting floor
action. H.R. 3403 is scheduled for October 14-16 and S. 960 should
be voted on by the end of October. CMA is exploring the possibilities
for an amendment in the Senate providing federal preemption and
uniformity of hazardous materials transportation laws. There is also
a possibility of efforts to add undesirable floor amendments.
TRANSPORTATION:
RAILROAD DEREGULATION
A hearing on rail deregulation has been scheduled by the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee for November 10. Th
oversight hearings are expected to address problems involved with
implementation of the Staggers Rail Act that passed in the last
session. CMA is in the process of preparing comments to be submitted
for the record and may present testimony.
TRANSPORTATION:
MARITIME REFORM
Legislative proposals that would revise the regulation of
int rnational liner shipping operations in foreign commerce are
being considered. Hearings were held in late September before the

10
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Subcommittee on
Merchant Marine. CMA presented testimony on S. 1593, a bill
offered by Chairman Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) and filed a supplemental
statement for the record in response to questions given the CMA.
witness. Activity has also begun in the House Merchant Marine
and Fisheries Committee. Merchant Marine Subcommittee Chairman
Mario Biaggi (D-NY-10) introduced a bill, H.R. 4374, and scheduled
hearings for October 7, 13, and 19. CMA is preparing to file a
statement for the record.
Both Senate and House versions may proceed to early markup,
even though the Administration position is not expected until the
end of October.
TRANSPORTATION t
USER FEES LEGISLATION
There is increasing interest in legislation dealing with the
inland waterways system and harbors and ports. User fees are a
major component of President Reagan's economic proposals, and
legislation is being introduced to permit authorities to collect us
fees to repay improvement and development costs. Proposals are bei
circulated and hearings could be announced in both the Senate and
House. CMA is working with a coalition of organizations as the
issues and timetables unfold.
REGULATORY REFORM LEGISLATION
CMA is actively seeking passage of omibus regulatory reform
legislation. Cooperating with allied business groups behind the
leadership of the Business Roundtable, CMA has assisted in the
development of S. 1080, the Regulatory Reform Act, introduced by
Senator Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.). The focus has been to secure amend­
ments which would provide that "good science" be considered a prin­
cipal factor in the regulatory reform decision-making process.
S. 1080 has been reported with amendments by both the Senate
Judiciary Committee and the Senate Government Affairs Committee.
The Government Affairs version of this legislation includes one of
CMA's "good science" amendments. CMA is working to assure that a
compromise version will be passed by the Senate in the near, future.
In the House, the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative
Law favorably reported H.R. 746 (Danielson-D.-Calif.) to the Full
Committee October 1, 1981.
CMA 037822

PATENTS:
RESTORATION OF THE PATENT TERM
CMA continues to work actively in support of legislation to
restore to the term of a patent grant the period during which
marketing or use of a patented product is delayed because of the
ne d to secure Federal regulatory approval.
The key bills on this subject are S. 255 (Mathias-R-Md.) and
H.R. 1937 (Kastinmeier-D-Wis.) and they are substantially similar.
Th Senate bill passed in July. The House Judiciary Subcommittee
on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice began
its hearings on this subject in September and held subsequent hearings
in October.
CMA is working in a business coalition under the leadership of
the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association to secure passage.
PATENTS:
UNIFIED COURT OF APPEALS
On October 14, 1981, the House Judiciary Committee favorably
reported, with amendments, H.R. 4482, a bill to establish a single
court of patent appeals. This bill may be taken up on the House
floor under suspension of the rules within the next few weeks.
The Senate version, (S. 1700, Dole-R-Kans.), will be marked up
by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, October 20. The key
issu at that time will be a proposed amendment by Senator Baucus
(D-Mont.) to allow the present Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal to
retain jurisdiction over patent appeals. CMA is working closely in
the coalition of allied business interests in support of s.. 1700,
and in opposition to the Baucus amendment.
STATE AFFAIRS
STATE AFFAIRS SPECIAL COMMITTEE:
INTERNAL DEVELOPMENTS
At its September 17 meeting, the State Affairs Special Committee
was briefed by CMA Technical Department staff on current and emerging
air and surface water issues at the state level. This paralleled a
similar briefing on Federal Superfund implementation made at the
prior meeting.
CMA 037823
12
ISSUE TASK GROUPS
In addition to endorsing the committee charter, subsequently
approved by the Executive Committee and Board at their Septemb r
meeting, the committee addressed its legislative and regulatory
priorities for 1982. This process began with the distribution
of a state issues survey which canvassed all member companies,
CMA staff, and key technical committees. Based upon the results
of the more than 100 responses received, the committee established
issue task groups in the following areas:
e
e
e
e
Hazardous Waste Disposal (Superfund and Siting)
Hazards Communication (Right-to-Know)
Hazardous Materials Transportation
Environmental (Air and Water Quality)
Within its assigned subject area, each issue task group will:
e
e
e
e
e
monitor the introduction and progress of State
legislation and significant regulation;
identify the component elements of the issue;
where appropriate Association policy does not
exist, work with CMA technical and functional
committees to clarify or develop the required
policy;
working through member companies and appropriate
local entities, seeks to coordinate industry
participation in state legislative and regulatory
advocacy programs;
provide support, through the State Affairs Special
Committee, to all CMA committees and program area?
in order to assure a consistent Federal/State policy.
October meetings were held so that issue task groups could
organize, address any remaining 1981 legislative and/or regulatory
proposals, review 1981 activity, establish contact with the corresp<
ing CMA technical staff and technical committee for briefings on
policy, develop procedures and assign responsibilities for informat:
and intelligence gathering, analyze states which are likely to b
active, and discuss advocacy mechanisms and coalitions. Issu task
groups will continue these meetings through the fall to prepare for
the beginning of the 1982 legislative sessions.
FUNCTIONAL TASK GROUPS
The State Affairs Special Committee established two functional
task groups to address the communications requirements of the CMA
state program.
CMA 037824
13
The Electronic Service Task Group will;
e
e
serve as the forum for the periodic screening
and selection of vendors of electronic legis­
lative and regulatory tracking services;
monitor the performance of the contracting
vendors and serve as a liaison between the
chemical industry subscribers and the elec­
tronic services suppliers;
coordinate periodic training and information
sessions for member company personnel on
equipment and system services.
This task group formalizes the efforts of an ad hoc group of chemical
industry companies who contracted with an electronic state bill and
regulatory tracking service for 1981. With these contracts expiring
at the end of December, the task group has been engaged in selecting
an appropriate vendor for 1982. This process is now complete and
contracts are expected to be signed in early November. In addition,
the task group is actively encouraging additional member companies
and allied trade associations to sign up for the state monitoring
services.
The final task group is designed to provide the basis for
coordinated nationwide communications on state legislative and
regulatory matters for the chemical industry. The Network Task
Group wills
e
e
e
by drawing upon the resources of CMA member
companies and Industry Councils, develop a
register of personnel to provide the basis
for both intelligence gathering and advocacy
efforts;
interface with other national and state trade
and business associations to facilitate the
exchange of information and the coordination
of activities;
provide through its personnel register, additional
resources to the issue task groups to enhance
their delivery capabilities;
seek to enhance the effectiveness and influence
of the chemical industry in the various states
by working to strengthen or organize Chemical
Industry Councils or other similar groups as
focal points for local efforts.

CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL RELATIONS
The State Affairs Division staff is continuing its efforts to
meet personally with members of the various CIC's. During Septembex
and October, state councils in Michigan, California, New Jersey
and Tennessee were visited.
1981 LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY WINDING DOWN
The vast majority of state legislatures have adjourned for
the year with only a few of the major industrial states remaining
in regular session. A few states are in special session to considex
particular issues such as reapportionment and taxes. There has beer
some activity this fall in several states on two of our priority
issues.
SUPERFUND.
On September 24, Governor Brown signed into law SB 618 which
culminates a long and difficult debate in California over stat
Superfund. Starting with three widely divergent bills sponsored by
competing interests, the final product (SB 618) reflects significant
success on the part of the chemical industry. Although some of the
provisions of the state act go beyond what industry advocated, the
final version is much more reasonable than the radical proposal
advocated by the Brown administration and its environmental supports
On the whole, industry worked closely and effectively on this issue.
CMA contributed the services of its legal staff to assist in draftin'
language during late June and early July. Also, the California C1C
has recently decided to establish a permanently staffed office.
In New Jersey, discussions are continuing concerning proposed
comprehensive amendments (NJ AB 3411) to the State Spill Fund Act
which pre-dates Federal Superfund. Complicating these discussions
are the lawsuits brought by five New Jersey companies (Exxon, Tennec
BF Goodrich, Monsanto and Union Carbide) in New Jersey, and by the
State of New Jersey against EFA in Washington in which CMA interv net
These suits seek to address the question of whether New Jersey's tax
is preempted by Federal Superfund. It is still possible that the
New Jersey Legislature will take up this subject in lame duck sessior
in November. CMA has worked closely during the past several months
with both the CIC and the litigants group to keep all parties fully
informed.
RIGHT-TO-KNOW
Hearings were held on September 15 in Madison, Wisconsin, on
AB 615 which is sponsored by Assemblywoman Muntz.
Industry is workii
to insure that its most damaging provisions are not passed.

On the municipal level, Cincinnati, Ohio scheduled hearings
in October on an ordinance that is potentially very unfavorable
to industry. Santa Monica, California, is also moving on a
similar proposal.

REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Chairman Fernanda., reported the following actions taken by the Executive
Committee the preceding day:
CMA 037883
2193
Approved expansion of CMA's state affairs program, including the
addition to staff of two professionals and one support person at
an annualized cost of $123,000. This is to be accomplished within
the current budget reduced by $300,000 and within the presently
authorized 147 personnel level.
e
Approved the recommendation of the Communications Committee that
the T.V. ad program be postponed indefinitely. Dr. Fernandez then
put this decision in perspective by reviewing the history of the
communications program, including ChemCAP, and advising that rec­
ommendations will be received from the Communications Committee
involving a significant reduction in print ad expenditures and a
change in emphasis in the print ad program.
e
Heard a report from Finance Committee Chairman Sella. The loss of
several members will result in a dues shortfall of approximately
$300,000 this fiscal year which would translate to a budget deficit
of about $400,000 when combined with the approval of an expanded
state affairs program. The Executive Committee will receive recom­
mendations to control- and reallocate expenditures to implement the
state affairs program and at the same time avoid the deficit. A
larger budget deficit in fiscal 1983-84 could occur if calendar year
1982 sales, upon which next year's dues are based, are lower than
originally estimated. To anticipate this. Board members will be
contacted in early October for an estimate of 1982 sales. This will
make better planning possible for fiscal 1983-84. The preliminary
budget for fiscal 1983-84 will be prepared on the assumption that
expenses will be reduced to accommodate about one-half of the fore­
casted deficit, the other one-half to be made up from reserves. It
is hoped there will be some increased interest income which would be
helpful. Specific recommendations will be received at the October
meeting of the Executive Committee. In view of the indefinite post­
ponement of the T.V. ad program, and the contemplated reduction of
the print ad program, the ChemCAP special assessment in December will
be reduced to approximately one-half of the originally approved 40
percent level to reflect the actual forecasted communications ex­
penses. It is planned that this will be the last special assessment,
since the June dues billing for fiscal 1983-84 would be adjusted up­
ward accordingly, to reflect the permanent expansion of the public
relations effort, including special issue advertising which would be
at a substantially reduced level from previous ad expenditures. This
billing, which may be looked at as being the sum of the dues plus the
special assessment, would see a decline from 140 percent to approxi­
mately 126 percent of the previous dues base.
e
Heard a report from Membership Committee Chairman Caldwell concerning
membership retention and recruitment. The committee was requested to
continue the development of its proposed plan but defer action until
the economic environment was more propitious.
Chairman Fernandez then solicited help from the Board members m con­
tacting the following companies, who have resigned for financial reasons:

ASSOCIATION ACTIVITIES
Report of the President
e
CMA's officers have met with the EPA Administrator, Mrs. Gorsuch
and her key staff to develop a dialogue between EPA and the
chemical industry. Issues discussed have been those of high
priority, e.g., Superfund, siting problems, and clean air. Dis­
cussions of current issues will continue. At the next meeting
these will include protocols for the negotiation of settlements
of waste site situations under Superfund and the inclusion by
EPA of mining sites in Superfund payouts. Again, the Board mem­
bers were requested to be supportive of EPA in public comments
and also to invite EPA personnel to tour chemical plants to en­
hance their understanding of the industry. Meanwhile a program
is planned which will involve visits of designated EPA representa­
tives to selected facilities.
e
Mr. Roland advised of the formation of a Steering Task Group, a
New Chemicals Task Group, and an Existing Chemicals Task Group by
the Chemical Regulations Advisory Comnittee; an Air Regulations
Task Group by the Environmental Management Committee; and a Task
Group on Hazard Communications and a Task Group on State Activities
by the Occupational Safety and Health Committee.

of the
ENERGY COMMITTEE REPORT
TO THE CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
August 30, 1982
EXHIBIT A
Tbs Cma Energy Committee focused Its efforts on developing
support for legislative notion in FT 81/82. This activity
will'continue to require close attention since legislation on
complex issues is rarely coapleted during one session of
Congress. Progress on energy Issues was, however, unusually
ponderous this year because the budget and other economic
Issues were given higher priority. The Reagan Administration
initiated a policy of greater reliance on market forces to
determine fuel choices and to some extent, energy prlees and
supplies. The Energy Committee also initiated some positive
steps toward energy regulatory reform.
CMA Energy Committee attention is concentrated on the
following selected Issues:
Hatural Cas Issues
Legislation to deregulate natural gas was Introduced and CMA
remains active In congressional hearings on this priority
issue. CMA advocates total phased deregulation of all natural
gas wellhead celling prlees by a certain date and the
coordinated removal of gas market restrictions such as
incremental pricing, fuel Dee Act prohihltlona and limited
access to gas supplies.
CMA was identified as a key player in the natural gas debste
when it sponsored a major study that compared and evaluated 10
studies on natural gas deregulation. The analysis prepared by
Foster Associates indicated that the more comprehensive
studies agree with CMA’s view that substantial economic
benefits to the nation would result from phased total
deregulation of natural gas.
Strong CMA communication efforts
publicized the results of the study through a press
conference. Capital Hill briefings for congressional staff and
support of lobbying activities.
The total FT 81/82 budget for Energy Committee research and
consulting projects was $40,000. Actual expenditures totaled
$43,314 and are detailed in Section XII. The research and
consulting budget for FT 82/83 is $30,000.
The total FT 81/82 budget for outside legal counsel was
$38,500. Actual expenditures totaled $1,500. The budget for
Emergency Preparedness
Unnecessary legislation for standby petroleum price and
allocation controls was defeated. CMA advocates maximum
reliance n market forces in the event of a petroleum supply
disruption.

REMARKS TO CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
by James D. Beatty
Chairman, Energy committee
August 30, 1982
Good morning. My Energy Committee report is a bit like a good news, bad news
story. The good news has already happened in the year just completed; the bad
news is waiting to happen in 1983. And it may if we relax our efforts during
the current year.
Last year I optimistically titled ay report "New Horizons", anticipating that
we had reached a major turning point in federal energy policy. That ve could
correct the excesses of the past and in particular the overregulation of the
Carter years and the five part National Energy Act of 1978. That we could
move from supply regulation and demand restriction to supply stimulation
through free market pricing, knowing that further gains in energy conservation
and fuel switching and most Importantly market stability and predictability
would follow. That optimism was based on the election of Ronald Raagan with
his free market energy platform. It is useful to review two parts of the
energy plank of the 1980 Bepublican platform.
"In order to increase domestic production of energy, Republicans
[we] advocate the decontrol of the price at the wellhead of oil and
gas....We also believe that market restrictions on the use of
natural gas should be eliminated.
"Republicans [we] understand that a free market based on the
collective priorities and judgments of individual consumers will
efficiently allocate the energy supplies to their most highly valued
users.
The President has delivered on many of his energy pledges. The Energy
Committee likes to think that ve have helped over the past year.
last year we identified two major items for our energy agenda:
Natural gas deregulation, and
Elimination of inequitable federal allocation schemes for the
distribution of crude oil under the Emergency Preparedness Allocation Act.
For Emergency Preparedness, we prepared recommendations and testified before
Congress and lobbied for no bill to replace the expired EPAA. While these
efforts didn't convince Congress that a bill was not necessary, we believe
they did help to reinforce President Reagan's resolve that no bill was
needed. Although Congress passed the Standby Petroleum Allocation Act, the
President vetoed that bill and in a remarkable turnaround the Senate sustained
the veto after passing the SPAA by a vote of 86 to 7.
I also reported significant reductions in the regulatory burden of the Power
Plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act and this year I can again report even
further gains. These regulations were one of those identified for Vice
President Bush's Regulatory Reform Task Force.
CWA 037890

In March President Reagan ended any chance of Congressional action on the
deregulation of natural gas when he announced that he would not seek
legislation in 1982. While consumer activists and other opponents of
deregulation hailed the President's announcement as a major victory most
observers, recognized it as a postponement not a solution to the problems of
the Natural Gas Policy Act and the public debate has continued.
The Energy Committee recognized that the debate, particularly as reported by
the press, was not going in our.direction. The exaggerated claims of the
consumer activists and other opponents of decontrol were consistently gaining
headlines while more rational analyses were being ignored. The Energy
Committee commissioned Foster Associates, a nationally recognized natural gas
authority and consultant, to compare and analyze ten recent studies of natural
gas deregulation that varied widely in their findings on the impact of
decontrol. As you would suspect, the conclusions of each study supported the
views of the authors.
Foster found two studies decidedly more comprehensive and realistic
assessments of total phased decontrol. These were by the Department of Energy
and Standard Oil of Indiana.
Conversely, Foster found three studies predicted "exaggerated and
unsupportable field price projections" and hence contributed little to a
constructive analysis of the decontrol issue. In March we held a press
conference to release the Foster study and we followed that with a
Congressional staff briefing. Both events were well attended. Just last
month Representative Dannemeyer from California quoted from our study in the
current hearings before the House Fossil and Synthetic Fuels Subcommittee.
In 1981 our energy conservation resumed its upward progress by climbing to
24.22, 2.1Z better than 1980. This is particularly encouraging in light of
the stagnant economy. Our voluntary goal of 30Z appears well within reach.
It is also of interest to examine how our raw energy consumption has changed
since 1972. This table reflects raw energy usage as reported hy our member
companies. It has not been corrected for production changes. Significant
reductions have been made in fuel oil and natural gas consumption.
Surprisingly coal use is actually down slightly and electricity is up
substantially.
I'm afraid
the answer is Washington. This is the bad news. Last year we had two major
issues, this year we have three:
Natural gas decontrol continues.
Emergency preparedness Is in a state of remission, and
The newcomer is, of course, energy taxes.
CMA 037891
I
1982/83 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Let's examine our plans and goals for each of Che major issues.
First, natural gas deregulation.
The chemical industry consumes over two
trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually which is more than 10% of the
total United States consumption and about 25% of the U.S. industrial use.
1983 is our last chance for legislation to be enacted to replace the NGPA
before its partial decontrol occurs on January 1, 1985. The Administration
and Congress will be reluctant to address natural gas in 1984, a presidential
election year. Furthermore, our worst case risk is no longer just "no
action"; it is an extended NGFA. Our basic position on deregulation is that
che NGPA be amended to provide for:
Smooch and predictable phase up of all natural gas wellhead ceiling
prices to market clearing levels.
Free market access for all consumers, pipelines, and distributors to all
types of natural gas supplies.
A coordinated removal of supply and demand restraints Including the
repeal of the industrial sections of the Fuel Use Act and incremental
pricing.
In order to make significant progress over the coming months in the
deregulation debate, we must address in detail four areas of controversy.
First—the timing of "old" gas decontrol. The interstate pipelines,
distribution companies, and some predominantly interstate consumers are
reluctant to give up natural gas access and bidding advantages that they have
under the NGFA. Many are willing to decontrol old gas, but not simultaneously
with new gas.
Second—is the problem of producer/pipeline contracts. The interstate
pipelines are quite concerned about Imprudent contracts that they have signed,
particularly after the NGPA was enacted, that contain price escalator
clauses. In theory these clauses, upon decontrol, would Increase the price of
gas paid by these pipelines beyond market clearing levels. The pipelines want
legislated protection to prevent this possibility.
Third—is a windfall profits tax. Such a tax is a distinct political
possibility as a compromise to consumer activist interests and as a source of
added federal revenue which may be particularly enticing to a Congress facing
continued hugh budget deficits. We are concerned that full decontrol with an
excessive windfall profits tax could well be worse than the NGPA.
CMA 037892
Fourth--l« th« severity of price fly up upon deregulation. Most people's
views on total decontrol of natural gas are directly related to their
perception of the magnitude of the price increase that will result. The
consumer activists have effectively convinced the public that decontrol will
devastate.their personal budgets. The press continues to provide front page
coverage to these claims while more moderate projections by more knowledgeable
parties are deemed not newsworthy.
Most important of all, in our effort to obtain deregulation of natural gas, is
strong support by President Reagan. We will urge the Administration to
introduce a deregulation bill early in 1983 or to endorse a bill introduced by
a proponent of decontrol. Our committee's action plan includes:
Analyze the national supply/demand outlook for the nation and the
chemical industry beyond 1985.
Continue to present the CMA position before Congress and the
Administration.
Develop and distribute news releases and communications packages.
Form coalitions to develop reasonable compromises on the major issues.
The importance of the coismunlcations effort cannot be underestimated. Let me
cite a few examples of the headline grabbing claims of our opposition:
Frank McKee-United Steelworkers of America
"Natural gas decontrol would more than double current utility bills
for consumers and destroy an estimated three million Jobs in an
already staggering economy. Millions of Americans would have to
choose between eating and freezing."
The AFL-C10 Executive Council has called gas decontrol "the most
expensive short term Income transfer program in the history of the
nation—one that takes from consumers and gives to the energy
companies."
Dr. Mark Cooper of the Consumer Energy Council of America, "As
deregulation drives up fuel prices and inflation, dominos will fall
throughout the economy: output will decrease; unemployment will
increase; productivity will decline; gas supplies will decrease; and
equity will be undermined." The Council estimates that over the
next three years deregulation would cost American workers 300,000 to
450,000 jobs and $70 billion in lost wages while raising living
costs sharply and cutting up to $22 billion from the Gross National
Product.
Armed with figures like these and with inflated estimates that total
decontrol could raise the average household heating cost from $500
to $1,000 per heating season, many citizen action organizations have
mounted effective grass roots campaigns to fight decontrol. In
Milwaukee, 450 senior citizens confronted Senator Kasten then
undecided on the issue to sign a pledge against dec ntr 1. Chanting
"yes or no, yes or no", the demonstrators demanded that Kasten
declare his position on accelerated decontrol publicly. When Kasten
declared his opposition to decontrol, the demonstrators presented
him with a written pledge; Kasten signed the pledge.
CMA 037893
-5jusc a few weeks ago Che Comnictee for Economic Development and the
Conservation Foundation testified for Immediate deregulation before the House
Fossil and Synthetic Fuels Subcommittee. They also recognized the burden this
would be on the poor and recommended that $3--7 billion be allocated for their
needs. The Consumer Federation of America immediately labeled CED's proposal
aS "utter'cynicism".
While we do not anticipate that emergency planning will be a high profile
issue during 1983, we must be prepared for that possibility. The impact of
adverse action could be substantial. In the past the chemical industry has
not received equitable treatment under crude oil and petroleum product
allocation controls, particularly for feedstock. The chemical industry uses
about 5.7X of the nation's liquid petroleum for feedstocks and an additional
Despite the Presidential veto of the SPAA, Congressional
interest in legislation continues. It's difficult to feel secure about the
Middle East.
President Reagan recently signed into law legislation requiring that the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve fill rate be maintained at 220,000 barrels per day
and preferably at a target rate of 300,000. This legislation also requires
that the Administration develop a new distribution plan for the SPR. CMA
continues to support filling the SPR and the utilization of market forces to
properly distribute available supplies during a crude oil disruption.
Our committee action steps include:
Monitor emerging state allocation plans to evaluate the need for
preemptive federal legislation.
Monitor Congressional activity which could lead to SPAA type legislative
proposals in 1983.
Work with the Department of Energy to establish an equitable government
plan for distribution of the SPR oil in an emergency.
Develop background analysis and communications recommendation to achieve
support for the chemical industry's contribution to the national economy.
In June of this year when both the Senate and House were considering an energy
tax as a possible part of the recently passed tax bill, we lobbied against any
energy tax as inflationary, inequitable, and economically damaging through the
increase it would cause to the international balance of trade deficit. In
letters that we sent to Senator Wallop and Representative Sharp we opposed all
energy tax proposals and offered total phased deregulation of natural gas as
an alternate which would increase federal revenues within the existing tax
structure. Many observers rate the possibility of an energy tax high for 1983.
The tax possibilities are shown on this slide. Our analysis of the various
alternate?, which is still in development, ranks them from least impact to
greatest impact for a given federal revenue gain as follows: an increased
excise tax on gasoline, a BTU excise tax, an ad valorum tax, and finally an
imported and domestic crude oil or refinery tax. For perspective, the direct
g°st to the chemical industry of a lOd per gallon gasoline tax increase would
be quite modest at just a few million dollars annually. That tax would raise
$10 B. Conversely, a $3 per barrel fee on imported and domestic crude oil
including imported petroleum products would cost the industry nearly one
billion annually.
CMA 037894
Our committee plan includes: analyze likely tax proposals and develop
information to lobby against them, particularly the more burdensome energy
taxes; analyze the effects of a windfall profits excise tax on natural gas
with total phased deregulation of gas; develop coalitions to continue to
oppose burdensome energy taxes, and; develop feedstock exemption language
should an energy tax become inevitable.
There are secondary Issues that we will also address during this year. While
the Fuel Use Act regulations have been reduced dramatically, they still
exist. We will continue to follow with particular Interest the cogeneration
exemption and related activity in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and
the litigation in the courts on full avoided cost sale of electric power by
industrial cogenerators to utilities and interconnection with utilities.
Also, we will be evaluating the Administration's proposal to reogranize the
Department of Energy which will be reintroduced in 1983. We will examine the
DOE budget for Industry related portions that could be easily eliminated.in an
effort to support federal budget reductions. As this slide shows, energy R&D
is best accomplished by industry. The caption reads, "We've done it boss!
We've learned to get the gasoline out of gasohol!" Finally, we will continue
to work with the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air
Conditioning Engineers to further improve their proposed standards for heating
and ventilating systems in existing cosmercial and industrial buildings.
ORGANIZATIONAL AND RESOURCE NEEDS
A substantial majority of our resources will be focused on—natural gas
deregulation, energy taxes, and emergency planning.
Last year we requested and received substantially increased support from the
legal and communications staffs.
A major effort will be required to enact legislation to achieve total phased
deregulation of natural gas. This effort will require: an additional
increase in communication staff support, approximately $60,000 for a
consultant study analyzing the natural gas supply/demand situation through
1990 under the NGPA and its impact on the chemical industry (I might note that
our current budget for this year is $30,000), and an increase in government
relations staff support.
In conclusion, we estimate that the Energy Committee accounts for between 2
and 2 1/2Z of the CMA budget. Considering the importance and potential impact
on the industry of these energy Issues, we believe that our cost/benefit ratio
is quite good.
We appreciate and will continue to need high level commitment of member
companies-through your contribution of high level managerial talent.

REMARKS TO CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
by Robert L. Klausmeier
Chairman, Engineering Advisory Committee
August 30, 1982
introduction
The Engineering Advisory Committee is concerned with all
engineering aspects of chemical manufacturing. We do collec­
tively what would be difficult to achieve individually. Our
scope includes design, construction, operation and maintenance.
While there are many other engineering organizations,
this CMA Committee is the only one devoted strictly to chemical
industry benefits.
If we don't speak for the chemical industry,
who will?
Most of our effort focuses on developing national codes
and standards which are acceptable to the chemical industry.
Beyond that we sponsor forums on subjects of common interest,
for example computerized process control systems. Recently
we added improved support of education to our objectives.
In last year's report, I talked about our work on piping,
lectrical installations, vessels, pumps, boilers, and relief
systems and the codes and standards governing them. Then I
presented an overview of the private sector standards system;
its organization and critical importance to the chemical
industry.
Today, I will discuss in detail two subjects I mentioned
briefly last year so that you can have a better understanding
of the scope of this committee. Then I will describe our
latest venture.
Engineers can be accused of being detail people. We
are, someone must be. A chemical plant is made up of millions
of details, vessels, pipes, wiring, motors, pumps, valves,
insulation, tubes, welds, nuts and bolts. Each must do
what it is intended to do. And practically all of them are
specified by one or more national standards,
it is a good
thing they are.
If not, every company would have to do for
itself what has been done collectively. Can you afford that?
Early in your careers, most of you were probably equally
concerned with details.
Remember - the details are still
there, and each one must be handled properly. Where we can,
let's do it together.
CMA 037897
Electrical Codes and Standards
In past reports, you have heard about the work of our
Electrical Codes & Standards Task Group to protect our industry's
interest by keeping the National Electrical Code clean. We
have millions of dollars at stake. The code is amended and
reissued on a three year cycle, following very involved pro­
cedures. There are roughly 2500 proposals for change to the
1981 code for reissue in 1984. Of these, response is appro­
priate on perhaps 1500, and intense effort on 150. Unfortunately,
we cannot rest on our laurels. Once we have successfully
defended favorable amendments and resisted those which are
detrimental, the whole process starts again. Many of the sam
issues arise year after year, code after code. It is not
feasible for member companies to face this task individually.
A concerted effort is essential.
As far back as 1959, the code has required on electric
motors:
A remote controller disconnecting means capable of
being locked in the open position, or
A manual switch located within sight of a motor to
disconnect the motor from its source of supply.
A pushbutton and remote magnetic switch would be common
to either.installation.
In other words, lock it out in a
motor control center or disconnect it at the pump in sight
of the operator. Note the underlined word - or.
It has been
propsed before, is proposed, and probably will be proposed
again to change that or to and.
Sounds simple, just one more
switch.
A typical pump installation in a hazardous area consists
of a motor, pump, oil immersed pushbutton - straightforward minimum essential.
Remote from the pump is a motor control center. Push
the button at the pump and a magnetic switch in the control
center opens. Also remote, is a lockable switch separate
from the magnetic switch.
The magnetic switch is rated for the motor size and can
be opened safely under load.
Since these are usually located
in areas having less demanding hazard classifications, they
have less
stringent and less expensive design requirements.
Now consider the same pump installation with a safety
switch for each motor.
If the proposed change were adopted,
this is what would be required: hazard rated switch - price
$800 - installation cost $300 - total $1100 per motor.
CMA 037898
Not only expensive, but potentially unsafe.
If this switch
at the pump is opened under load, it will arc.
If not horse­
power ra’ted, it could explode.
I will leave it up to you to estimate the cost of this
unnecessary complication on each new motor installed. Retro­
active application has not*been proposed, but some zealot may
try it at any time. Retrofit would cost more like $1600 per
motor and a modest size chemical plant will have upward of
1000 such motors.
process Control Systems
Now let's leave the code turnpike, try a different road,
and explore a new area: Computerized Process Control Systems.
It is new, exciting and underdeveloped. Sounds like a
description of parts of the Napa Valley.
But like the Valley,
it has its pitfalls. Fortunately, we have good guides - our
Process Control Task Group.
On May 13 and 14, the T&sk Group conducted its third
Process Computer Users Forum. Half a day was devoted to
Distributed Control Systems. Unique to this session were
presentations by non-company member people, a professor and
a journal editor.
This was followed by discussions of Human/Control System/
Process Interface, Retrofit of Existing Plants, and Integrated
Control Systems.
Integrated Control Systems are those which
. combine distributed regulatory control systems and management
information systems.
We have heard the term Distributed Control Systems for
the last several years.
It you are like me, you had an idea
of what was meant but were a little vague.
In a simplified distributed system, there is something
to be controlled, for instance a valve. A signal is sent.
This indicates the current condition.
It is received by the
controller, where it is analyzed, and, if necessary, corrective
action is taken to open, close or adjust the valve. Early
analog devices were elementary by today's digital standards.
The modern controller is much smarter.
However, it neither sees all nor knows all.
Some jobs
are too complicated for it to handle. A higher capacity
central process computer will monitor many parameters as well
as signals to and from the controllers.
It can make far more
complex calculations considering input from many sources.
CMA 037899
It can tell the controller what action to take and may even
reprogram it to react properly to changed conditions. Equally
important, the main computer can be equipped with a voluminous
and reliable long term memory.
It can store process data; then,
in case of an upset, it can retrieve and analyze the data to
isolate the cause.
In an integrated system, the information
is also available to business computers to process management
information.
Fortunately for us humans, even the central computer
needs to be monitored and occasionally corrected.
So there
are still operators, but they are operating with far more
powerful tools than available before.
The term Distributed is used to describe the distribution
of functions to individual controllers versus control directly
by a central unit.
These systems are no't only cost effective, they look
good too.
The last half day of the forum was devoted to open
discussion and a critique of the previous sessions. Seventyseven people from 33 companies attended. This compares to
78 at the 1980 forum. Evaluation sheets showed overwhelming
support for another forum. Comments were consistently favorable.
We also provided papers for those who couldn't attend.
The Engineering Advisory Committee reviewed this Task
Group's charter and supports another forum planned for May
1984*. This is subject to review and evaluation early next
year. The explosion, a better word is detonation, of control
technology is more than individual companies can handle. Cost
efficiency dictates cooperation.
Aid to Education
what should the industry do about the depletion of
educational faculty and facilities? We don't know, but we
decided it would be wise to determine where we are before
we decide where to go.
We started with a survey through engineering contacts
to find out just how and how much our industry is committing
to support of education. Analysis of returns is underway.
Unfortunately, only 39 companies responded.
However, those
39 indicated contributions of over $48 million, an impressive
number. We think this can be used by the Communications
Committee as an image improver. We believe that distribution
of a summary report of the analysis will encourage increased
support. Though the level of support by individual companies

will be lcePt confidential, foresighted companies can be
recognized as leaders. Laggards should recognize their short­
comings and be motivated to catch up. No company is so small
or so poor that it cannot do its share. We will keep you
informed and make our recommendations later.
rnst Effectiveness
Ours is a low cost operation as far as CMA is concerned.
committee size is just large enough to provide a good
cross section. We have only five Task Groups. They have
specific assignments and hold comparatively few meetings. Our
demands on CMA staff, facilities, and dollars are small. But
we do a job which must be done, either within or outside of
CMA. Separate company programs to do what we do would cost
far more than ours. You are getting a good return on your
investment.
Our
Our work is prophylactic, not postnatal. We prevent
rather than react. Many regulations, particularly OSHA's, are
based on national standards. Under "new federalism", standards
prepared by the private sector will be used in more regulations,
both federal and state. We'd better be damned sure they say
what we want them to say.
It is better for us to speak up,
otherwise the fabricators, regulators, and unions will be free
to look after their own narrow interests.
Standards carry legal connotations beyond mere regulation.
There will be accidents, fires, explosions, and releases no
matter how hard we try to prevent them.
In fact and in court,
we must be certain that we have followed accepted industry
practice. Codes and standards equal good practice. Let's do
the job together. We can't afford to stand alone.
Now here's what you have all been waiting for.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT
TO THE
CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
August 30, 1982
Early sections of the 'report of the Government Relations
committee are devoted to its role, membership and organization.
Th committee is the focal point of the coordinated legislative
activities of the chemical industry in Washington.
Through
th cooperative efforts of a highly professional community of
Washington representatives, the Government Relations Committee
is able to provide a service which offers to CMA and its vari­
ous program elements:
monitoring of key issues;
advice during policy making;
legislative strategy development and political
analysis;
direct legislative communications programs.
where the importance of issues have dictated the appointm nt of a Committee Keyman or formation of a task group, the
staff executive/support function is provided by a member of
the professional staff of the CMA Government Relations Depart­
ment.
Special Activities
Section IVof the report describes the CMA Briefing Break­
fast and the CHEMICAL FORUM Luncheon series, both aimed at
promoting interaction between industry Washington representatives,
encouraging participation and keeping them abreast of develop­
ments on current issues. The CHEMICAL FORUM also serves to
enhance the reputation and recognition of CMA in the Nation's
Capital, since it features addresses by respected and widelykn wn public figures.
Last Year's Objectives and Progress
These are detailed in Section v, with much emphasis being
plac d on widening participation and sharpening internal proce­
dures .

-1CMA 037902
Issues
Section VI provides a series of reports by Keymen and task
group chairmen on important issues which occupy the attention of
the Government Relations Committee during this year.
These
issues represent the work product on which this committee pro­
vides overall legislative -service and leadership for CMA ad­
vocacy.
Legislative1 Timetable and Priorities
Section VIXis a chart which represents a new approach by
the Government Relations Committee in identification and prior­
itization of key issues. The Committee believes that this pro­
cess should be completed and formalized for all of the CMA pro­
gram.
It will be noted that the Committee believes that constit­
uent communication will be especially appropriate and productive
in the issues of the Clean Air Act. the Clean Water Act, Natural
Gas Deregulation, and Superfund/CERCLA. Similarly, legislative/
communications priorities seem to coincide in the areas of the
Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Natural Gas Deregulation, the
Occupational Safety and Health Act, and Superfund/CERCLA.
Committee Plans and Objectives
Section VIII explains three areas where "doing better" would
seem likely to produce important dividends for the chemical in­
dustry: linking legislative and communications efforts more
directly, more effective coalitioning, and the focusing of con­
stituent influence.
In the area of communications and public understanding, the
Committee is forming a task group to:
create more interaction between communications
professionals and government relations professionals;
identify priorities;
set timetables,*
develop new "messages";
target communications programs to Congressional
districts.
With regard to coalitions, the Government Relations Committee
plans to discourage creation of new organizations to handle co­
alition efforts on issues, and at the same time, to encourage more

attention to the coalitioning process in the larger umbrella
business organizations.
In order to promote a sharper focus on constituent commu­
nications with specific key Congressmen, the Government Rela­
tions Committee has begun efforts to:
identify legislative issues which best lend them­
selves to constituent communications;
identify communications issues from a similar
perspective;
survey the constituent contacts capabilities of
member companies;
identify Congressional committees which handle the
most important bills;
develop more detailed home district data on
Congressmen'who serve on key committees;
develop a voting record evaluation of key mem­
bers of Congress.

Supplement
REMARKS TO CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
BY ROBERT E. HAMPTON, CHAIRMAN
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS COMMITTEE
AUGUST 30, 1982
I am pleased to have this opportunity to present the annual GRC report.
X would like to call your attention to the written report, previously dis­
tributed to you, particularly Section V, 1981 - 82 Committee Objectives
and Progress; Section VI, Keymen's Report on the Substantive Issues; and
Section VII, Major Legislative Issues Timetables and Priorities as I will
not cover these matters in my presentation.
Last year we reported on the implications of the political changes
brought about by the election of President Reagan and a Republican Senate
and how these changes might impa.ct on the chemical industry, effect the role
of the GRC and our legislative efforts. We mentioned that the economic
issues, taxes, budget cuts, and Social Security Reform would dominate the
time and attention of both the Administration and Congress and that we did
not expect major environmental or health legislation to pass in 1981. In
addition, we stated that these issues would be put off until 1982, bringing
them into consideration during an election year, thus making it even more
difficult to achieve substantial amendments. We also stated that this did
not mean that efforts should not be made to amend key legislation, but we
had to be realistic about our chances for success. We pointed out that
significant legislation might be set aside and no final action taken until
1983.
This now appears to be the case.
We are greatly disappointed that the seemingly favorable political
makeup of the Administration and Congress did not produce results; but
what has happened was not totally unexpected.
However, we are continuing to work for comprehensive changes in a
number of laws, and the organizational objectives we achieved last year
place us in a much stronger position to advocate change than in the past.
By a more systematic focus on strategy and planning, improving communications
and coordination within the CMA structure and continuing efforts to educate
members of Congress and Administration officials with well-reasoned positions
and good backup data, positions on the issues have been changing for the
better.
It is against this background that the GRC critiqued its activities and
developed our objectives for the coming year. The major question we asked
ourselves was how can we do better and what are the things we have to do to
be better.
CMA 037905
We examined the various factors that impact upon the legislative
process and the roles various institutions play in influencing that process:
The media, public understanding of the chemical
industry and media influence on Congress.
Business coalitions in Washington.
CMA, the GRC itself, Washington Representatives
and the industry.
The chemical industry and its political clout.
Chemical industry issues and priorities.
I would like to cover just two of those factors:
First, one of the essential ingredients in setting the scene for
achieving legislative success is* "communications." Why is it when our
industry advocates changes in legislation that the public perceives it
as an attempt to gut a law that protects them and the environment and that
our sole reason for wanting change is cost. Why does this misconception
carry over to the Congress which gives us sympathy and understanding, but
out of fear of public opinion will not vote to support responsible changes
that are well justified on the merits and by good science. The main
reason is the single message persistently carried by the media, influenced
by environmental groups, that industry-advocated changes gut the law, and
that industry wants change only to save money. This oversimplified, easyto-state message, substantiated by a few isolated examples from the past,
but presented as a generalization, has created a total misconception of
the chemical industry.
To accomplish our industry's legislative goals, the GRC feels it is
essential that we take the necessary actions to clear up these miscon­
ceptions by better coordination of our communications program with our
legislative goals.
We will identify those issues of importance, prioritize them, set
goals and timetables, assist in developing communications that are effec­
tive in the legislative arena, and create a new sense of direction and
urgency.
The GRC will take action jointly with the Conmunications Committee
to deal with the issues. We have voted to form a task group on legis­
lative/communications to oversee these activities; and through this group,
target communications-related projects.
The second essential ingredient is what we referred to in our report
as £°£us. The chemical industry has considerable political clout (if you
want to call it that), but we are not sure that this clout is being used
in the most effective way. This is a sensitive area and one we are hes-
CMA 037906
cant to discuss because it could be misinterpreted as interfering with
This is not the case. We are all in the same
boat on these issues even though legislation may impact differently on
individual companies. We are all affected by the passage of legislation
that calls for further regulation of our industry—so we either sink or
swim together. What we will be trying to do is prudently direct and
utilize this clout to accomplish -our legislative objectives.
internal company business.
we plan a number of actions to gather information on just where
the industry stands and the details of these activities are spelled out
in Section VIII of our report. We will need your personal commitment and
support in this effort.
Another sensitive area I would like to mention is CEO involvement in
this process. There are times where certain high-level contacts must be
made within the Administration or with the Congressional Leadership.
some cases this already has been done). It is our opinion that we can
only achieve credibility at that level by representation from the top.
The hired guns can go only so far—then the system calls for bringing in
the big guns on specific issues where an appropriate relationship exists.
This involvement will be requested through the proper CMA channels and
here again we ask you commitment.
we believe the committee plans and objectives for 82 and 83 of im­
proving communications, working in coalitions and focusing on influence
energetically pursued will go a long way toward enhancing our chances of
achieving our legislative goals.
A LOOK AT THE FUTURE
t
As far as the Executive Branch is concerned, we are being listened
to and we have not been faced with a flow of new regulations. Deregulation
has not produced the changes we had hoped for but there has been improvement.
This takes time. The reform movement has lost some momentum as EFA and,
to a lesser degree, OSHA have baen under political attack. This is apparent
in legislation being considered by Congress in that a number of amendments
to various laws are designed to force EPA into taking action or handcuffing
them where they have used their discretion on issues the environmentalists
hold dear.
Action by the Administration in lobbying for changes in environmental
legislation is invisible. The White House is keenly aware that public
opinion holds little sympathy for amendments to environmental, health and
safety laws and is keeping a low profile on the issue.
The bot,tom line is that we cannot expect too much Executive Branch
support on environmental legislation at this time. Also, we should be
alert to the signals that the white House is concerned about its image on
CMA 037907
environmental issues, and in order to neutralize this issue we can expect
some administrative action (regulatory) to show their concern for those
issues.
As far as Congress is concerned, the votes in the House on FIFRA, and
Clean Air in the House and Senate causes great concern. Many months of
work with the congressional committees in hammering out compromises have
easily gone down to defeat on the floor of Congress because of the emotional
and political climate that exists today.
what we are seeing today is a number of battles in a war where the
outcome is still in doubt.
At this stage we do not expect any major environmental legislation to
pass this session of Congress.
(Look at forecast on specific issues in
Section VI) This forecast could change as the politics of the issues are
so complex it is difficult to give a precise reading. However, there will
be little time to deal with these issues between the time Congress returns
September 8 and adjourns the fir'st week in October. We are continuing to
work for comprehensive and constructive changes in the laws being considered
and this pressure is having the effect of extending the debate.
What about 1983 - 1984? We believe most of these issues will be
addressed in 1983. What will be the political situation at that time? The
outcome of the 1982 elections will determine the character of the next
Congress. There are as many opinions on what the character might be as there
are people who make predictions. We aren't qualified to predict but some
experts do not feel the change will be all that significant. Republicans are
predicted to maintain control of the Senate and will not loose a significant
number of seats in the House.
A key factor in 1983 - 1984 impacting on legislation will be the shape
of the economy and the jobs issue. Since 1984 is a Presidential election year,
what takes place in 1983 will determine the issues of the 1984 election, and
what Congress and the Administration believes to be public opinion will bias
consideration of environmental, health and safety legislation. This is one
of the reasons we believe our communications efforts are crucial.
We cannot be sure of the answers to those questions at this time. We
can only be sure that under any set of political circumstances our goals will
not be easy to attain, we are confident that the approach -we have developed
to deal with these issues will serve us well under any circumstances and in
the long haul lead to success.
We will not be disappointed if legislation is not passed during this
Congress because in most cases what is being considered is worse than,
or little better than, what now exists. To say that the situation will
only get worse next year could be interpreted as meaning we do not have
much confidence in our positions and we should not accept that.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
of the
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE REPORT
to the
CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
August. 30, 1982
Major Accomplishments
The Environmental Management Committee's (EMC) 1981*1982 year was full, diverand productive. The Committee effectively managed environmental issues
before regulatory agencies, Congress, and federal courts. In addition, a
greater commitment of resources was made to assist in the rapidly expanding
State Affairs program. A summary of the Committee's major accomplishments is
set forth in Chapter X. These accomplishments include the following:
o
After three years of extensive negotiations, CMA, EPA, and other
parties concluded a settlement agreement on 37 of 54 issues raised
as part of litigation challenging the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) implementing regulations. The settlement
agreement is highly favorable to industry and will result in effective
control of our discharges to the nation's waters.
o
Over the last year and a half, CMA sianaged a cooperative study with
EPA to ascertain the removal efficiency of toxic organic pollutants
by existing chemical industry biological treatment facilities. The
consultants report of the study concluded that well designed and
operated biological treatment, in*place, is doing an excellent job in
removing toxic organic pollutants from chemical wastewaters (i.e.,
over 86 percent removal). CMA developed a radio show and TV news
feature about the report and has conducted seven media tours on water.
o
The EMC continued a major resouree*intensive effort, in conjunction
with the Government Relations Committee, to have the Clean Air Aet
amended. Amendments are necessary to obtain relief from bureaucratic
and cost*ineffactive requirements presently in the Act. At this time
it is difficult to predict when and in what form such amendments will
be enacted. The EMC worked with the Communications Committee to pro­
vide spokesmen for clean air media tours in 24 cities.
o
CMA has been extensively involved in discussions with EPA and other
concerned parties over EPA's implementing regulations for Subpart
C of RCRA concerning hazardous wastes. Over the past year, the EMC's
efforts have begun to bear fruit. EPA now recognizes the chemical
industry’s concern that the regulatory system not be a disincentive
to internal reuse and recycling of wastes, and will revise its defini­
tion of solid waste to essentially exclude such wastes from the
hazardous waste system. And, EPA has revised the mixture rule by
redefining which wastewater streams are hazardous, thereby removing
1385 chemical industry surface impoundments from the system.
Industry's approach will result in effective reduction in hazardous
waste and more effective use of by-products in waste streams.
CMA 037909
Research and Consulting
Th« total FY 81/82 budget for EMC research and consulting projects was $587,800.
Actual expenditures totaled $583,857 and are detailed on pages 9 through 13.
The research and consulting budget for FY 82/83 is $300,000.
Program Outlook
Although it might seem that there should be a trend toward decreasing activity
in the environmental arena, this is not the case. EPA staff are slowly
adopting some of the messages espoused by top Agency administrators. Our
continued input to EPA is required to guarantee progress. During this time
that is generally viewed as store cooperative than adversarial, all levels at
the Agency are requesting industry input to their prograsts. A positive
response by industry will require even store stember company and staff resources
than in the past. Our continued regulatory efforts can result in more costeffective regulations for industry that can also result in a substantially
improved environment.
The EMC will be challenged during the next year to respond to the EPA and to
adequately support legislative and judicial issues as they arise. We will
need resources to respond to possible amendments to the Clean Air Act, Clean
Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking
water Act. There may be litigation related to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and many familiar
environmental issues will become important at the state level. We will there­
fore be in a continuous process of setting priorities and concentrating our
resources where they will have the greatest likelihood of positive impact on
the industry.

REMARKS TO CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
by Will D. Carpenter
Chairman, Environmental Management Committee
August 30, 1982
Earlier this year, in a conversation with the Chairman of the Board,
I consented that in the environmental arena, a perfect score is zero, and
« food score is a small negative number. It's probably not that bad, but
vc aust run hard to stay in the same place.
The Environmental Management Committee has several key messages to
bring to the Board, and X appreciate this opportunity to address the
environmental issues that impact the chemical industry.
Last year, t’^yne Jaeschke, the EMC Chairman, made several obser­
vations about the*year ahead to this group. . .the year we have just
completed. His remarks are a useful point of departure.
EMC identified nine issues we felt would require the major part of
our resources. Those issues included, of course, the CAA legislative
report. The water permits program and related water regulation were
second, followed by RCBA and Superfund issues. Ve then listed several
"cross-cutting" issues common to all or several of the above. Regulatory
reform, good science, economic consideration of regulation, and the state
issues were the major cross-cutting issues. In retrospect, the EMC
members and CMA staffers can be pleased with their crystal ball. With
20/20 hindsight, we don't need to change one. The next part of my
presentation is to answer the obvious question:—"If you were so smart
about predicting the issues, what did you do about them?"
First, let me say that the EMC was adequately resourced by the
B ard. We had good support from the member companies, and the staff
delivered for us time and time again. We managed our resources well.
Our outside expenditures were 99% of budget. 70-80% was expended as
planned. The remainder was shifted to more urgent, higher priority
projects that surfaced during the year, as we constantly monitored our
resources to ensure maximum effectiveness.
There were a number of accomplishments that are worthwhile discussing.
Ve selected six that are among the most significant. As one analyzes these
results, we can very nicely use them to give you a better insight into how
EMC does its work, in addition to the type of results obtained.
t
Of the six results reported here, two have to do with water; one
vitb air; and three with solid waste. . .one RCRA and two Superfund.
CMA 037912
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Regulations (NPDES)-(Water Permits)
After three years of extensive negotiations, CMA, EPA, and other
parties have concluded a settlement agreement on 37 of 54 issues raised
as part of litigation challenging the NPDES implementing regulations.
The settlement agreement is highly favorable to industry. The key points
are as follows;
Permit application requirements have been reduced.
There is a substantial increase in flexibility for calculating more
favorable numerical permit limitations which should result in
reduced treatment costs.
Procedures for challenging permit conditions will be more
reasonable. This should reduce the cost and manpower needed to
secure acceptable final permit conditions; and
Dischargers will have increased flexibility in avoiding noncompliance penalties when violations occur as a result of
inadvertent or unknown circumstances.
Fourteen of the reauining issues have been set aside for litigation
later during appropriate permitting cases. As a result, the actual
number of issues to be briefed with the Court of Appeals has been limited
to a reasonable number, thereby achieving our secondary objective of
reducing cost of managing the issue.
CMA/EPA Five-Plant Study
Over the last year and a half, CMA and EPA jointly managed a co­
operative five-plant study to ascertain the removal efficiency of toxic
organic pollutants by existing chemical industry biological treata»nt
facilities. In a recent CMA consultants report on the study, it was
found that current in-plant biological treatment is doing an excellent
job in removing toxic organic pollutants from cheatical waste waters.
Over 86 percent removal of toxics was achieved. The study provides EPA
with the best long-term data on the removal efficiency of biological
treatment for toxic organics and should play a key role in EPA's develop­
ment of effluent guidelines for the organic, plastic, and synthetic
chemical industry. We hope EPA will use this data to conclude that no
additional technology beyond current well-designed and operated biological
treatment is needed to define BAT (best available control technology
economically achievable). Much of our effort this next year will be
devoted to this task.
Clean Air Act Amendments
As you all know, a lot of EMC's effort over the last two and a half
years has been directed at Clean Air Act amendments. With the Government
Relations Committee, we have been pursuing a strategy to obtain relief
fr m current bureaucratic constraints in the act and to obtain more
cost-effective clean air programs.
CMA 037913
Many of the reforms we are seeking have been adopted at one time or
another by the House committee. These include better PSD and non-attainment
program! and streamlined SIP procedures. It is important that we get a bill
through with these improvements. At the same time, there are problems,
principally in the hazardous air pollutants area. The anti-industry coalition
bss demonstrated far greater impact than industry or the administration had
anticipated. It is clear that this part of the Act will be changed whenever
amendments are passed. Ve are working hard now to make sure these changes
include needed improvements whi-le protecting our industry's interests.
RCRA Implementing Regulations
CMA over the past several years has been extensively involved in
discussions with EPA and other concerned parties over EPA's implementing
regulations for Subpart C of RCRA concerning hazardous wastes. Several
of the discussions were, in fact, settlement negotiations of outstanding
judicial challenges to the prior administration's implementing regulations
that were technically incorrect or that imposed inappropriately stringent
requirements that offered no commensurate environmental benefits. Over
the past year, the EMC's efforts have begun to bear some significant fruits.
One example is EPA's recognition of the chemical industry's number one
concern that the present regulatory system inappropriately created a dis­
incentive for the chemical industry to internally reuse and recycle wastes.
EPA is now finalizing a proposed revision of its definition of solid waste
that will rectify this concern by essentially excluding industry internal
reuse and recycling of wastes from the hazardous waste system. A second
example is the agency's revision of the mixture rule by redefining which
wastewater streams.are hazardous. This modification removes 1385 chemical
industry surface impoundments from the hazardous waste system, 945 of which
would probably have needed replacement.
Hazardous Waste Site Management Plan
Pursuant to directions from the Board that the hazardous waste
response center direct its efforts to assistance for member companies in
disposal site cleanup, the task group has managed the preparation and
publication this spring of the definitive work on waste site sunagement
entitled, "A Hazardous Waste Site Management Plan." The document has
been designed to aid in the development of site management plans for
clean up of sites and to assist in mitigating any potential or actual
adverse environmental effects. The site management plan is being used by
member companies and federal and state agencies as a critical management
tool in resolving health and/or environmental problems created by hazardous
wastes in inactive disposal sites.
Superfund Implementation
As you are all well aware, Superfund and its implementation is an
exceedingly high priority issue for the EMC and the chemical industry.
The resource commitment we have made to date in order to obtain a
reasonable implementation of Superfund has definitely been a costeffective decision. In this regard, EPA has just .recently promulgated
CMA 037914
-4the final revisions to the National Contingency Plan. These are con­
sistent vith the positions that CMA has advocated on this natter. The
key points are:
No dt^al standard for cleanup between fund financed versus privately
financed cleanup;
Fund financed cleanups should generally be tied to the priority list
of sites; and
A flexible standard as to how clean a site would have to be under a
Superfund cleanup initiative.
Although several significant issues still remain to be addressed
(i.e., mining site cleanup funding, state Superfund preenption, tort law
and waste end studies), the industry advocacy effort has resulted thus
far in aore reasonable iapleaentation by EPA than first indicated.
After this brief description of six key issues, 1 would like to use
a few slides to give you an insight into the aanageaent of issues by the
EMC. Ve will focus on areas qf impact, resources, and results.
In each slide, the issues are listed on the left. In the first
slide, the area of impact is indicated on the right. The areas listed
are obvious. However, it is of interest that the EMC with CMA staff
moves effectively across these four areas with a large number of issues.
As you can see from the slide, frequently our efforts have impact in
more than one of these four.
In the next slide, the same six issues are listed again to show the
key resources used for each of the six. Of course, CMA staff is involved
in every action, but the comparative effort varies from issue to issue.
In the final two slides, we focus on the bottom line. Justifications
are arbitrarily broken into four listings. Once again, we can win in
more than one way. As an aside, we must improve on expressing our
actions in terms of positive impact on the environment. For instance,
the 5-plant study shows that procedures already in place have reduced
pollutants in water by hundreds of thousands of tons over that expected
by EPA. The industry and the administration are interested in costeffective regulation. . .as well we should, but the public wants to hear
what happens to the environment. Ve must provide that information for
our own interest, and learn to do it routinely. . .in our formal comments
on legislation and regulation, in our casual discussions with the influence
people, as well as our ChemCap program.
Now, let us look ahead. Using the previous format, I will discuss
the legislative area first. In the coming year, we can expect amendments
to RCRA and the CVA, which are already underway. Before the next annual
report, the legislative effort on CESCLA will be underway, vith the CAA
still uncertain.
CMA 037915
With the make-up and mood of Congress presently and in the next
year, we anticipate ve will be swinging upstream. Given the other option
of sinking, however, we shall continue to paddle like hell. With good
technical support and policy guidance through EMC, we expect to reach our
goal of c.ost-effective, environmentally responsible regulations.
The regulatory arena will be active for virtually every major
environmental law, as Wayne Jaeschke reported last year. It was
demonstrated that it takes more effort and resources to participate in a
cooperative regulatory atmosphere than it does to object in the hostile
environment that existed two years ago. Now is our chance to be part of
the solution.
The EMC thinks there are several watchouts during the coming year.
Some are issue*related. . .others are cross-cutting. Let me list some of
those.
Groundwater—It's hard to predict when a groundwater incident will be
used against industry the way PCB's, Love Canal and others did to
catalyze TSCA and Superfund.
A cross-cutting issue is EMC members' impression of disturbing
congressional attitudes on a key subject. The banner of good laws and
regulations based on good science does not have the isipact on Congress
that it once did. Some members of Congress are claiming that this is
merely an excuse to delay implementation of regulations. Although the
Government Relations group is responsible for our congressional arena,
the EMC bases its efforts on the underlying principle of good science.
We must meet this challenge successfully.
In addition to the federal issues, state issues will demand effort
from EMC members, with Superfund and disposal sites being major examples.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)—Ozone revisited for S02,
Superfund Implementation—will be a continuing area of effort. Some
important issues will be in litigation, including litigation in which CMA
may participate. Many cleanups will be underway and some completed.
Data will need to be compiled for future efforts to sunset the fund.
1) Assistance to state groups on state legislation; 2) tort law.
With a substantially reduced budget, we must select our priorities
carefully, and review our progress and needs to determine how to organize
and direct our efforts. We must improve in our coordination with other
CMA groups. Such techniques as tele-conferences, fewer (only needed)
people at meetings, elimination of some meetings, and better coordination
of meetings will be necessary.

An understanding of the issues end appreciation of the situations.
An insight into the long-term nature of our work, whether legislative,
regulatory, or what. The effort extends over several years, and the
need.for adequate resources in the bad years is there. When our
resources are limited, we become more vulnerable to poorly conceived
and executed governmental programs. We have to stay active in such
times and carefully set our priorities.
Recognition that environmental issues' activities will continue to
accelerate through 1984.
Perhaps most importantly, we ask for your support in maintaining
member company participation at an effective level. We'll try to
improve their effectiveness. During these tough times, we ask that
you find the ways to make these outstanding people available. 1 can
assure you that you get no better return for your money anywhere.
For cost-effective regulatory management, EMC efforts are good for
you.

EEC's Restrictions on Confidentiality
of Identity of Substances
The CMA/SOCMA International Affairs Croup's EEC Compliance Task Group has
invested much effort recently to determine the extent of interest of member
companies and their European affiliates in changing EEC's rules for the
above. These rules comprise explicit denial of such confidentiality in the
EEC inventory of existing substances, and a limit of three years of
confidentiality for non-"dangeroue" new substances notified by manufacturers
or importers to member states. At lAG's request, the Trade Representative's
Office asked EEC formally for resolution of this potential trade barrier.
This interest is intense, but concentrated in only a few sianufacturers of
il-additives, photographic film, and specialty polymers. Some Europeans are
supportive, but think the effort futile, given the EEC's administrative
limits and the potential difficulties in amending the ‘67 Directive, Sixth
Amendment.
SC's formal response to ISO is overdue and may not arrive until early or^
mid-September. If the response proves negative, as hinted informally, IAG
will likely recommend halting this effort and advise the concerned companies
to devise their best individual strategies.

PROPOSED PROGRAM ON METHYLENEDIANILINE
Problem/Background:
On Juna 1, 1979, the Interagency Testing
Committee (ITC) recosnended that 4,4'-Methylene*
dianiline (MDA> be considered for testing for
its toxic effects on human health and the envi­
ronment. The ITC recommended the following
studies: carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, terato­
genicity, other chronic effects, environmental
effects and epidemiology. In a December 31,
1981, filing with the U.S. District Court, EPA
indicated that they expected to make a decision
on ITC's testing recommendation on MDA in calen­
dar year 1982. In response to the recommendation,
MDA manufacturers asked CMA to set up a program
on this chemical. Accordingly, the Special
Programs Division convened an exploratory meeting
where the group wrote a program charter and ten­
tative budget. The proposed charter was reviewed
and received favorable responses by the Special
Programs Advisory Committee (SPAC) and QlA staff.
Objective;
In its June 1982 filing with the Court, EPA re­
moved MDA from its 1982 schedule, but stated its
intention to complete action on this chemical by
mid-1983. The Panel will, therefore, spend the
next two months collecting and analyzing data in
order to recommend a reasonable regulatory re­
sponse to EPA.
Recommendation
That the Executive Committee accept SPAC's recom­
mendation for approval of this program.

REPORT TO THE CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
ON
INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACTIVITIES
August 31, 1982
Presented by
Leo H. Johnstone
Vice Chairman, "Phillips Petroleum Company
International trade issues continue to be an area of high activity.
As reported before, the current recession has promoted various types of pro­
tectionisms all around the world. The GATT Ministerial meeting to be held in
November will be extremely important for setting the direction of international
trade in the '80's. A prime item on the u. S. agenda for that meeting is to
obtain a recommitment to free trade as well as to complete certain items left
over from the Tokyo Round. In addition, it is planned that the GATT agreements
be expanded into services (such as banking, insurance, engineering, and con­
struction) plus an investment code and expansion and redefinition of the
generalizations system of preferences. Trade relations with Europe are not
at their healthiest state in view of the U.S. sanctions regarding the Soviet
gas pipeline and the counter-vailing duty decision regarding steel imports
into the United States from Europe. On the other hand, the GATT Ministerial
could not come at a more appropriate time from the standpoint of trying to
head off conditions which could escalate into trade retaliation and a re­
enactment of the Smoot-Hawley Bill of the 1930's which magnified and prolonged
the Great Depression. There are just a few items I would like to touch on to­
day which are covered generally in your briefing book, some of which deserve
some expansion.
1. The petrochemical discussions.. There have been no more
developments in regard to further discussions with the EEC. Although
there continues to be some anti-dumping activities, the European
chemical industry appears to be more preoccupied with internal condi­
tions in seeking means of rationalizing the significant over-capacity
that exists. There has been considerable activity regarding prepara­
tions for talks with Mexico, including direct government-to-government,
tn setting the stage, plus two meetings with the Department of Commerce
by the panel of advisors from a number of CMA member companies. The
advisors that your and other CMA companies have made available are in­
deed knowledgeable and experienced and are making significant contribu­
tions. The greatest challenge at this time is to define objectives
and reach a consensus on objectives among the advisors and with the
Department of Commerce. Work is proceeding along these lines and the
International Trade Committee of the CMA is actively pursuing this.
The first meeting with the government of Mexico has been scheduled for
sometime in October. However, I made a trip to Mexico recently and the
task force of the International Trade Committee has considered the
matter and we are recommending to the Department of Commerce that the
CMA 037923
October meeting be deferred until sometime after the first of
December when the new government of Mexico takes office, it is not
felt that meetings prior to that time would be productive. The
present chaotic economic conditions in Mexico are also a factor in
this recommendation.
There have been no meetings held with Japan although we con­
tinue to hear that a meeting will be requested by them. It is also
possible that sometime in the near future we will get a similar re­
quest from Canada.
2. Competitive assessment studies are being conducted by the
International Trade Commission and independently by the Department of
Commerce regarding the U. S. petrochemical industry. The purpose of
these studies is to attempt to assess the impact of actions and policies by other governments on the competitiveness of the U. S. chemical
industry and are significant to us in that they will no doubt form the
basis for the attitude of the U. S. Government regarding our petrochemi­
cal industry in trade negotiations in the future. A number of companies
have been asked for input'into these studies and we will hopefully be
able to see early drafts in order that inaccuracies and misunderstand­
ings are not promulgated.
3. A very significant item which is coming from various direc­
tions including the Industry Policy Advisory Committee, as well as
through other channels, is the dangerous and insidious Vredeling proposal
being considered in the EEC governmental system. While most of you may
be familiar with the Vredeling proposal, I find that some are not, so I
would like to describe it briefly. This proposal would be a directive
regarding workers rights in the community which extends from EC practice
of local information exchange and consultation to the world stage. It
would require annual disclosure of information by management to employee
representatives and prior consultation with labor representatives cover­
ing major corporate worldwide activities and decisions including mergers,
shifts in production, plant closings and even introduction of new tech­
nology into existing plants. This directive is for companies employing
at least 50 employees in EC countries. It would require that each year
the parent 0. S. company would submit information to the management of
its EC subsidiaries which would in turn provide it to the local union
labor representatives covering the parent company's worldwide activities
related to its economic and financial situation, the possible develop­
ment of the business, products and sales. It would include production
and investment programs, manufacturing and working methods, including
new working methods, technological innovations and health and safety.
The subsidiaries would be required to consult with the employee repre­
sentatives at least 30 days prior to any corporate decision which is
likely to have a substantial affect on the employees' interest with a
view to reaching agreement on the measure planned. The company must post­
pone any decision until the union opinion is received or until the 30-day
period has elapsed. In addition, employees at any other subsidiary than
the one directly affected may also demand to.be consulted. The proposed
CMA 037924
I
directive also contains provisions under which the employee representa­
tive is authorized to open consultation with the parent company manage­
ment under a by-pass provision. The employee representative will be
granted appeal rights to tribunal or other national authorities in the
event a management fails to fulfill the provisions of the directive.
This, of course, has numerous drawbacks which include an extra-territorial
reach giving unions the ability to negotiate with multi-national com­
panies on global corporate plans and at the corporate rather than the
individual plant level. It could involve submission of data which may be
in violation of securities law and SEC regulations, access to corporate
confidential or proprietary information and establishing a precedent
guaranteeing worker consultation on an international basis.
This directive is now before the European Parliament for a vote
the week of September 13. The EC Commission are to reconsider and proba­
bly redraft the directive for consideration by the EC Council of Ministers
in mid to late 1983. If adopted, the individual member states would be
required to implement the directive through national legislation.
This directive has become highly political and represents a major
priority for the European Trade Confederation which has effectively lob­
bied for it. Business lobbying on Vredeling in the U. S. is coordinated
through the National Foreigh Trade Council, the U. S. Council for Inter­
national Business, the 0. S. Chamber of Commerce, and the NAM. Initially,
the lobbying took the form that this proposal is so bad that it should
simply be discarded. Present wisdom is that since some form of Vredeling
will be adopted, lobbying should take the form of attempting to revise the
proposal to something that can be lived with. Ivor Richard of Great
Britain is the commission member who will be in charge of the redrafting
and is the guru of the Vredeling proposal, having inherited this role from
Vredeling upon the latter's retirement. Richard has indicated in speeches
and other discussions that he is flexible as to the final form.
At the present time, the CMA position regarding Vredeling is being
formulated and should be forthcoming in the near future. However, in the
meantime I would urge you to become more familiar with this proposal and
its potentially harmful effects.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE
Petrochemical Discussions
The state of the international petrochemical markets has caused unpre­
cedented government to government discussions about petrochemicals. Three
EEC/U.S. talks were held. The Departtnent of Commerce is preparing for talks
with the Mexican government. One discussion on petrochemicals has occurred
between the U.S. and Japanese governments, with additional talks in prospect.
Competitive Assesmnent Studies
The International Trade Commission is investigating the impact of petro­
chemical production by oil-producing nations on the U.S. petrochemical industry.
Independently, the Department of Commerce is preparing a competitive assess­
ment study of the U.S. petrochemical industry as a special project at the be­
hest of Secretary Baldrige.
Legislation
The growing concerns of the U.S. Congress about trade problems are illus­
trated in Senator Danforth's bill (S. 2094), “The Reciprocal Trade and Invest­
ment Act of 1982." Its provisions may well affect trade, intellectual property
* rights and investment of the U.S. chemical industry.
Vredeling Proposal
It is likely that a directive will be issued in 1983 or 1984
Market that will affect U.S. subsidiaries operating there. It is
Vredeling Proposal and presently contains disclosure requirements
tions of information about matters affecting employees' interests
affording unions consultative rights with management.

EXHIBIT L
REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
WILLIAM M. STOVER
BUDGET AND TAXATION:
PRESIDENT GIVES TAX INCREASES NEEDED PUSH
In July the House and Senate agreed to a compromise budget resolution that
would produce a deficit of $103.9 billion in Fiscal 1983. Overcoming almost
impossible odds. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bob Dole (R-Kans.) held his
troops together in the Senate to pass a three-year, $98 billion tax increase
shortly before the Fourth of July. The House Democratic leadership confounded
longtime Washington observers by electing to go immediately to conference on
the Senate tax bill without attempting to adopt improving amendments.
The conservative revolt against the tax bill that failed to materialize
in the Senate, showed initial signs of strength in the House. Led by Congress­
man Jack Kemp (R-NY), the early opponnents of the Senate tax program included
many of the same representatives who supported passage of the President's 1981
tax program. Just as several key business trade organizations announced their
opposition to major segments of the Senate bill, the President committed the
prestige of his office and his special powers of "friendly persuasion" to
encourage recalcitrant Congressmen to support passage of the Senate tax program.
The Senate Finance tax package represented a significant retreat from the
business tax reforms adopted in 1981. Both Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Dole and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Domenici (R-NM) emphasized these
changes were needed to reduce the level of projected Federal deficits over the
.next three years. Several provisions in this package would place added tax
burdens on capital intensive industries, especially the chemical industry.
Meeting in marathon negotiating sessions, House-Senate conferees reached
a conference agreement which was remarkably close to the package reported by the
Senate Finance Committee. The most important provisions of the conference
agreement affecting capital formation included:
o
Reduction of ACRS (Depreciation) and Investment Tax Credit
The conference agreement would reduce the basis of property
for ACRS purposes by one-half the amount of the investment
tax credit and/or energy tax credit. In general, the effect
of this provision would be to reduce the value of the invest­
ment tax credit from 10 percent to approximately 7.8 percent.
As alternative, businesses could continue to take full ACRS
benefits, provided the amount of the investment tax credit
was reduced to 8 percent.
CMA 037945
The maximum amount of tax that can be offset by
the investment tax credit would be reduced from
90 ta 85 percent of actual tax liability.
I
Most importantly, the accelerated rates of ACRS
recovery now scheduled for property placed in
service after 1984 would be repealed. To chemical
companies this was the most important single
feature of the 1981 tax legislation.
o
o
Minimum Tax and Reduction of Corporate Tax Benefits Including
DISC
In addition to the present corporate minimum tax, the conference
agreement would reduce certain enumerated corporate tax benefits
including DISC deferrals by 15 percent.
Section 936 Possessions Corporations Credit Limited
j
i
The section 936 possessions corporations credit affecting
investment by U.S. corporations in Puerto Rico would be
severely restricted. In addition, the bill would require
acceleration of corporate estimated tax payments and would
impose additional limitations on corporate pension contributions
and benefits.
The conferees rejected a last minute effort of a business coalition to reduct
the bill's impact on capital formation and corporate after-tax earnings.
At present, there appears to be no enthusiastic reception from House
Democrats for any proposal to compromise on this issue. In addition, there is
concern that if action is not taken to reduce ACRS this year, the budget deficits
projected for 1985 and 1986 would be unacceptably high.
CLEAN AIR ACTi
OUTLOOK BLEAK FOR HELPFUL AMENDMENTS
(As of August 16) Clean Air Act amendments are being considered by both
the Senate Environment Committee and the House Commerce Committee in an effort
to report bills before the August Congressional recess.
The House mark-up of H.R. 5252 resumed August 10, focussing on Section 112 —
the point at which Chairman John Dingell (D-MI) had recessed mark-up on April 28.
Chairman Dingell and Ranking Minority member James T. Broyhill (R-NC) had said
that continuation would depend upon resolution of four issues — Prevention of
Significant'Deterioration (PSD), acid rain, mobile sources, and hazardous air
pollutants (Section 112). The Dingell-Broyhill leadership worked with a group
j
i
CMA 037946
of "swing vote" members to produce a compromise package which they hoped would
result in a safe margin of votes. More Democrats were especially needed, besides
the four who have voted with Dingell previously.
Despite the prospect of only a total of 6 Democrats in support of a com­
promise package, Dingell indicated the first week of August that mark-up would
resume, and the legislative language of the compromise finally was released.
The CMA Environmental Management Committee task group assessment of the two
parts of the compromise on which CMA has an official position was: 1) on the
issue of PSD, the compromise was much better than present law; and 2) on
Section 112, the compromise was within EMC policy guidelines. CMA participated
in the Clean Air Working Group effort to secure votes for the leadership com­
promise — on Section 112 the amendment was to be offered by Congressman Thomas
A. Luken (D-OH). The Luken language would amend the April 28 Broyhill substitute
to Florio's amendment which provided for automatic listing of substances under
Section 112.
The outcome, on August 11,. was defeat of the Broyhill-Luken substitute by21 to 20 (1 abstention).
The final vote was on adoption of the Florio amendment, amended by Congress­
man w. j. (Billy) Tauzin (D-LA) to provide for a de-listing procedure after
automatic listing. The Tauzin/Florio language passed 22-20.
Chairman Dingell later told a group of industry, labor and Administration
representatives that he must move ahead despite the defeat on Section 112.
In the Senate, the situation in the Committee on Environment and Public
Works is far from encouraging. To date, there has been little positive benefit
in amendments on non-attainment, and virtually nothing useful in the PSD and
ambient standard-setting (secondary) amendments. In addition, an acid rain
amendment passed 15-1 on July 22, providing for 8 million tons reduction in
annual emissions of sulfur dioxide in 12 years. While the amendment will directly
impact the electric power industry it will indirectly affect all companies'
utility bills.
To date, the Committee has not dealt with Section 112 in mark-up. Committee
staff have been interested in the language of a bill, by Senator Bennett Johnston
(D-LA), s. 2795, introduced July 30. It provides for automatic listing of
substances without specifying the 37 currently under review by EPA.
If the Senate Committee does not draw from Senator Johnston's amendment or
the Florio-Tauzin amendment in the House, it could decide to approve the pending
committee print, which is also highly undesirable.
Clean .Air Working Group efforts are under way for introduction of a positive
comprehensive bill on the Senate floor if the current bill is reported out of
the Environment Coimnittee. A comprehensive bill could be crafted from the Garn,
Byrd, and Riegle-Levin bills, none of which have been considered in the Stafford
Committee.
CMA 037947
CLEAN WATER ACT LEGISLATION
The Administration has racantly sent its package of comprehensive Clean
Water Act amendments to Congress for consideration this year. CMA has a number
of major concerns with the Administration’s package. First* it does not address
BAT modification; second, it maintains national categorical standards for pre­
treatment; third, it establishes administrative penalties and felony sanctions.
Another major issue to be considered during the clean water debate, but not
contained in the Administration's proposal, is the establishing of Federal Common
Law. CMA is strongly opposed to a part of the Clean Water Act amendments.
The Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Environmental
Pollution, chaired by Senator John Chafee (R-RI), held hearings on July 21, 22,
28 and 29. CMA, represented by Mr. Monte Throdahl (Monsanto Company), testified
on July 22 and focussed primarily on the BAT modification issue. Senator Chaf««',
subcommittee is not expected to begin mark-up until mid-September.
On the House side, the Public works and Transportation Subcommittee on water I
Resources, chaired by Representative Robert Roe (D-NJ), held hearings on the
Clean Water Act on July 27, 28 and 29. Q4A was once again represented by
Mr. Throdahl. We presented an in-depth explanation of the history and success
in implementing Best Available Technology (BAT). Chairman Roe entered into an
extensive discussion with Mr. Throdahl on the BAT issue which clearly indicated
that the Congressman fully understands and appreciates the need for flexibility
in the application of BAT to avoid "treatment for treattnent's sake". Representatii
Roe's subcommittee is not expected to begin mark-up until September.
CMA has initiated an extensive media effort on Clean Water legislation.
* We are also working with the business community's clean water coalition organized
under the Washington Environmental Coordinating Cosmittee (WECC).
PENDING AMENDMENTS TO THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA)
The House Energy and Commerce Consnittee has reported H.R. 6307, which contain
a number of amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act which are of
concern to CMA. The bill was then referred to the House Public Works and Transpor*
tation Committee for consideration of Section 4 (Hazardous Wastes Mixed with
Domestic Sewage) and Section 9 (National Groundwater Coamission). Mr. Jeff
Zimmerman, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, testified on behalf of CMA on May 26
before the Public Works Committee. On June 11, the Public Works Committee report^
H.R. 6307 with changes to these two sections that would delete the reference to
RCRA in section 4 and would expand the groundwater study beyond hazardous waste
contamination. The accompanying report (No. 97-950, Part LL) also raises many of
the concerns expressed in CMA testimony.
During the same time period, House Commerce Subcommittee staff was meeting
to attempt to address several issues raised by CMA and other groups. On June 24, 1
CMA 037948
I
Congressman Florio (D-NJ) introduced H.R. 6699 in response to these issues.
The bill, which Representative Florio says he will offer as a floor amendment to
H.R. 6307, would change the word "substances" back to "hazardous wastes" in
Section 6 (Burning and Blending of Hazardous Wastes as Fuel) and Section 11
(Beneficial Use of Hazardous Waste). These changes will satisfy a serious
concern of CMA.
Commerce Committee Chairman Dingell (D-MICH) has requested and been granted
an open rule which means H.R. 6307 could be considered on the House floor before
the August Congressional recess. This could allow floor amendments to resolve
additional concerns expressed by CMA and other groups, including revisions to
Section 3 (Small Generator Exemption), Section 7(a) (Final Permitting Conditions),
and Section 10 (Creation of Federal Common Law).
In a new development, Representative Floyd Fithian (D-IND) received
permission from the House Rules Consnittee to offer a superfund amendment to H.R.
6307. The Fithian amendment would change the financial contribution ratio for
municipal dumpsite clean-up. The Superfund now requires a responsible municipality/
state to contribute 50 percent of the money to clean up a site. Representative
Fithian wants to change it to only a 10 percent contribution from the municipality/
state. This amendment would put additional financial strains on the limited
resources of the Fund, and therefore CMA is opposed to the Fithian amendment.
Uncertainty remains as to how the Senate will deal with the comprehensive
amendments to RCRA contained in H.R. 6307. On May 27, the Senate Committee on
Environment and Public Works reported S. 2432, which does little more than re­
authorize and provide two-year funding for RCRA. Because of the House activity.
Senator Chafee held an additional day of hearings on June 24 to receive testimony
on many of the issues in the House bill. CMA testimony was presented by Mr. Bill
Moore, Rohm and Haas Company.
On June 17, Senators Hart and Moynihan introduced S. 2644, which would re­
quire EPA to list, within 18 months, hazardous waste which could no longer be
disposed of in landfills. It is reported that Senator Hart will offer this as
as amendment to S. 2432.
In sumnary, after an extremely fast start, the process to amend RCRA has
slowed but not stopped. It appears likely that some changes will be made to RCRA,
but it is unclear what form a final bill will take. CMA continues to bring its
concerns to the attention of the appropriate members of Congress.
TESTIMONY ON SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT
The Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Toxic Substances
and Environmental Oversight (Gorton, R-WASH) held a fourth and final hearing
July 28 on SDWA reauthorization. These hearings are important because they will
focus on who has the authority (Federal, State, or Local government) to manage
ground water resources and the recharge areas. Mr. Fred Steinberg of PPG Industries
testified for CMA at these hearings in support of some minor reforms to the SWDA
and in opposition to federal management of ground water resources.
CMA 037949
ENVIRONMENT. SAFETY AND HEALTH - EPA OVERSIGHT BY FOUR HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEES
On July 21 and 22, four Subcommittees chaired by Congressmen Moffett (D-Conn.)
Scheuer (D-NY), Gore (D-Tenn.) and Waxman (D-Cal.) held joint hearings on EPA
oversight. Though ostensibly a review of the first 14 months of Anne Gorsuch's
administration at EPA, it was called a "political sideshow" and a "witch hunt"
by several Republican members including Congressmen Larry Winn (R-Kans.), Bob
members ably defended Mrs. Gorsuch. Their willingness to characterize the
hearings for what they were - a media circus - had a positive effect on the type
and content of the media coverage. No new issues were raised, as the same litany
previously aired in the media was heard again; budget cuts, personnel changes and
morale, groundwater strategy, liquids in landfills, RCRA and Superfund implemented
TSCA, enforcement efforts, lead in gasoline/Thriftway, secret meetings, research
and development, and the like.
The following conclusions may be drawn. First and foremost, Anne Gorsuch
more than held her own. She ably withstood the political attacks, and responded
with good points of her own. The media coverage was not unfavorable to her. One
TV report called it "a trial not a hearing", film clips showed her cool, calm
and collected throughout, and quoted one Democrat Congressman calling the hearing
a "waste of time." Second, the chemical industry was not made a target of the
hearings. CMA was mentioned only once or twice, for example in connection with
our PMN exemptions petition. Third, we believe the hearings failed to achieve
the Democrats' purposes. Although not permitted to present live testimony, OlA's
efforts to work with Minority Members of the Subcoemiittee and with EPA paid off.
CMA submitted a statement for the record of the hearing.
SAFETY AND HEALTH - CMA TESTIFIES AT SENATE HEARING ON TSCA OVERSIGHT
On August 4, Senator Slade Gorton's (R-Wash.) Subcommittee on Toxic
Substances and Environmental Oversight (Cononittee on Environment and Public Works)
held a hearing on TSCA Oversight. Hamilton Hurst, Vice President of Nalco Chemicil,
Company, testified on behalf of CMA. SOCMA, EPA's Dr. Todhunter, NRDC and the
Conservation Foundation also testified. The hearing focused on 1) negotiated/
voluntary testing under section 4; 2) the PMN process in general, and CMA's
exemptions petition for low risk chemicals under section 5(h)(4); 3) EPA's
section 8(a) reporting rule; and 4) international harmonization efforts/OECD-MPD.
The entire tone of the Senate hearing was constructive and not adversarial,
unlike recent House media-oriented events reviewing EPA's first 14 months under
Anne Gorsuch. CMA achieved its goals of providing a balanced review of EPA's
accomplishments in implementing TSCA, and educating the Subcommittee as to
chemical industry concerns regarding reasonable interpretations of TSCA. Chairman
Gorton learned of the real progress being made by the Agency, and of the advantage
to the public and EPA, as well as to the industry, that will result from
negotiated testing agreements and PMN exemptions. Barring unforeseen development!,
the Subconmiittee sees no need to consider amendments to TSCA at this time, and
1
will return to TSCA next year.

SAFETY AND HEALTH - PMN TEST DATA
Congressman James Florio (D-NJ) has requested the Office of Technology
Assessment (OTA) to conduct a review and analysis of the adequacy of the
toxicological test data contained in the premanufacture notifications (PMNs)
submitted under section 5 of TSCA. Security procedures have been established
to protect confidential business-information. The study is expected to be
completed this Fall, and depending on its results, Mr. Florio will undoubtedly
hold hearings either later in the Fall, if Congress is in session, or in the
Spring of next year in connection with TSCA reauthorization. Depending on the
outcome of the study, Mr. Florio can be expected to push for some type of fixed
set of PMN testing for all new chemicals, along the lines of the European
system (OECD-Minimum Premarket Data). CMA is handling this issue with great care,
we have written to EPA expressing our concerns about the handling of confidential
business information and about the scope of the review.
SAFETY AND HEALTH - ANIMAL RESEARCH TESTING
Congressman Doug Walgren's (D-Pa.) Science Subcommittee held hearings last
Fall and this Spring on a bill to promote non-animal testing and impose limitations
on toxicological research. Stringent limitations would be placed on research
laboratories including rigorous accreditation procedures, inspection of facilities,
review by community representatives and veterinarians, and recordkeeping. On
August 11, H.R. 6928 was reported by the full Science Committee of the House.
So
long as the Administration continues to oppose it, passage by the Senate is not
considered likely. CMA is monitoring developments.
SAFETY AND HEALTH - COMPARATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
A House Science Subcommittee held mark-up on Congressman Don Ritter's
(R-Pa.) risk analysis bill, H.R. 6159. The measure would establish a 30 month
research and demonstration program to improve comparative risk analysis techniques
in regulatory decision making, and to coordinate risk evaluation efforts among
nine federal regulatory agencies. The bill was reported out of the full Science
Committee, and passed by the House August 2. The CMA Regulatory Impact Special
Committee supports the concepts of the legislation.
SAFETY AND HEALTH - GENETIC SCREENING
The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), the scientific arm of the Congress,
is studying the extent to which companies are using genetic and cytogenetic
screening in the workplace. The study was requested by Congressman Albert Gore
(D-Tenn.), whose House Science Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight had
previously’held hearings last Fall and in June of this year. Although preliminary
results of the study show only a handful of the Fortune 500 companies are
presently doing any biochemical or cytogenetic testing, Mr. Gore seems predisposed
toward the position that many companies are rushing headlong into using such
screening as an employment tool that would discriminate against certain classes
of employees or applicants for employment. The OTA study is expected to be
completed this Fall, and Mr. Gore undoubtedly will have more to say on the subject.
A CMA member company testified at the previous hearing and we are monitoring
developments.
CMA 037951
ENERGY;
CMA TESTIFIES IN FAVOR OF NATURAL GAS DEREGULATION
On July 30, 1982, CMA testified before the Fossil and Synthetic Fuels
Subcommittee of the House Energy and Coimnerce Committee. The CMA Energy
Committee Chairman, James D. Beatty, Manager, Energy, - Engineering Government
Relations of the Procter and Gamble Company, presented the CMA viewpoint urging
that a phased deregulation of all natural gas begin by a date certain.
The
testimony addressed the serious shortcomings of the Natural Gas Policy Act of
1978, citing examples, and focussed on supply problems and inequities caused
by differing volumns of pre-NGPA gas in the various pipelines. The CMA testimony
came as part of a users' panel during the second in a set of seven House hearings
examining issues regarding natural gas decontrol. The previous hearing was also
devoted to receiving the comments of consumers of natural gas, and two studies
regarding the potential impact of deregulation were released. Gas distributors
and pipeline companies more recently presented testimony in early August. Further
hearings will soon be announced, and the Federal Energy Regulation Coimnission
(FERC) is expected to testify after Labor Day.
CMA coalition efforts continue and communication materials are being prepared.
There are no indications that proposals for natural gas deregulation will progress
beyond the hearing stage in this session of Congress.

bill. The bill prepared by the Senate Finance Committee in July does not
include the imposition of an oil import fee or any type of energy tax. However,
a ways and Means Committee staff memorandum does include a listing of energy
taxes and fees as possible items to raise revenue. The scope of conference
activity was limited to the provisions of the bill and existing law, therefore,
consideration of a tax or fee on energy were not addressed.
CMA efforts continue in opposition to any additional energy taxes or fees,
including imposition of a broad-based, ad valorem, "BTU" tax or oil import fee.
Our advocacy has emphasized the chemical industry dependence on natural gas as
feedstock, and that federal spending cuts and passage of accelerated natural gas
decontrol within the existing tax structure would be more desirable ways to
reduce the budget deficit.

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
On August 3, the President signed legislation setting a minimum fill rate
for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and extending until December 31, 1983,
the antitrust exemption for oil companies participating in the International Energy
Agreement (IEA). Public Law 97-229 requires the filling of the SPR (presently
267 million barrels of crude oil) at a rate of at least 220,000 barrels per day
with an ultimate goal of 750 million barrels. The legislation also calls for
the President to prepare a plan for withdrawal from the reserve. The plan will not
be subject to Congressional veto and will be triggered in the event of a severe
petroleum shortfall.

CMA continues to closely monitor emergency preparedness issues because of
the possibility of legislation and adoption in various states of price and
allocation plans for dealing with am oil shortage.
ENERGY;
REORGANIZATION Of THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
A bill has been introduced in the Senate that would merge most of the
Department of Energy functions into the Department of Commerce. A high priority
for legislative activity is being sought by the Administration, but little Senate
support has been evident.
In the House, no comparable bill has been introduced
and some Congressional critics have indicated that the Administration has not
provided the leadership necessary to move the bill forward. There is very little
likelihood of legislation in this session of Congress.
TRADE;
PETROCHEMICAL DISCUSSIONS
The international petrochemical business is in distress. This has resulted
in unprecedented discussions between governments about solutions to present and
expected market difficulties.
The EEC and the U.S. government have had three meetings which focussed on
the EEC claim that U.S. oil and gas price controls were an unfair subsidy to
U.S. petrochemical producers. These talks are dormant, but dumping charges hav
been filed against a number of U.S. products.
The Japanese have similarly claimed injury to the Japanese domestic and
export markets by U.S. exports of petrochemicals. The first govemment-togovemment talks have been held and more are to follow. The Japanese are considering
* filing dumping charges against U.S. products.
The U.S. and Mexican governments have agreed to petrochemical discussions
in the belief that there are difficulties ahead between the two countries. The
conversion of Mexico's oil and gas reserves into exportable quantities of petro­
chemicals is expected before the end of this decade.
Advisors to these discussions have been selected by the government from
candidates proposed by OlA. They have participated in the talks with the EEC and
will similarly participate in the Japanese and Mexican talks.
TRADE;
COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT STUDIES
Two studies are being made in the government on the future competitive position
of the U.S. petrochemical industry. The United States International Trade Commission
report investigates the impact on the U.S. industry of expanding petrochemical
industries in oil producing nations. In the Department of Commerce, a special
CMA 037953
I
office has been created by Secretary Baldrige for competitive assessment
studies of U.S. industries. The U.S. petrochemical industry report will be the
first effort.
CHA is cooperating with government departments in these studies.
TRADE;
RECIPROCITY LEGISLATION
Senator Danforth's bill (S. 2094), "The Reciprocal Trade and Investment Act
of 1982", was reported out of the Senate Finance Trade Subcommittee Hay 20. The
House counterpart is H.R. 6773, introduced by Representative Frenzel. Provisions
include extension of § 301 of the trade law to cover services, intellectual pro­
perty rights, foreign direct investment and negotiating authority for hightechnology goods.
As of August 3, S. 2094 has 30 co-sponsors and several endorsements from
business and agricultural groupjs. It is expected to go to the floor soon after
Congress returns from its August 18 recess. Concern exists over addition of
protectionist (domestic content) amendments which, according to Danforth, would
kill the bill. The domestic content bill in the House is H.R. 5133, and it has
220 co-sponsors.
The International Trade Committee, at the direction of the Executive
Committee, sent its endorsement of S. 2094 (excluding amendments) to the Senate
Finance Committee on July 19.
TRADE;
EXPORT TRADING COMPANY LEGISLATION
I
Export trading company legislation has been passed by both houses and is
now subject to joint conference.
(The vehicle is S. 734 with amendments — include:
language from Representative St. Germain's H.R. 6016).
If passed into law, a new
form of joint export effort will be possible. The CHA International Trade
Committee will determine how to advise member companies on use of the export trading
company form of marketing.
TRANSPORTATION;
MARITIME REFORM PROPOSALS DELAYED
j
The maritime reform bill reported out by the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee is still awaiting floor action due to opposition by
Senators Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH) and Strom Thurmond (R-SC). The delay has been
created because of antitrust implication, and because of Senator Slade Gorton's
(R-WA) opposition to an unrelated bill involving the Illinois Brick case. S. 1593
is supported by CMA and reflects consensus reached between representatives for
shippers and carriers.
House floor action on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee-reported
proposal, H.R. 4374, has been delayed until the resolution of antitrust concerns
by the House Judiciary Committee. Jurisdiction over the bill was asserted by the
Judiciary Committee and mark-up was completed in late July, with support from the .
Administration . Negotiations between the two Committees continue, and the questi4*
CMA 037964
now is which version will emerge from the House Rules Committee, CMA generally
supports the Judiciary version and would encourage no further amendments except
for language clarification.
If a unified version is presented to the House Rules
Committee, it is possible the bill could go to the floor under suspension or without
the opportunity for change.
Passage of a House bill similar to the Senate
measure would offer the Senate leadership the means to adopt the House bill, thus
foregoing conference.
CMA efforts continue as part of the Shippers' Coordinating Committee on
Maritime Reform.
TRANSPORTATION;
CANADIAN DIVERSION
Legislation that would restrict the movement of u.S. made products through
Canadian ports was unexpectedly sent to the House Rules Committee last month.
H.R. 3637 had been labeled non-eontroversial in an attempt to gain the opportunity
for House floor consideration. ; A rule for the bill was not given.
Opposition to the bill came primarily from a group of midwestern Congressmen,
and from CMA. Efforts continue to heep the bill from reaching the House floor.
REGULATORY REFORM LEGISLATION
The long delay in House consideration of regulatory reform legislation may
be nearing an end. Earlier this year the House Judiciary Committee favorably
reported an omnibus regulatory reform bill, H.R. 746 (Danielson-D-CA). Since
that time a new subcommittee chairman, Congressman Sam B. Hall, Jr., (O-TX), has
been named for the subcommittee that developed the legislation.
a
On March 24 the Senate passed S. 1080, the Regulatory Reform Act. S. 1080
is an amended version of legislation introduced by Senator Paul Laxalt (R-NEV)
and is strongly supported by the business comnunity. CMA was a part of the
business coalition seeking passage of this important legislation.
In July, the business coalition stepped up its efforts to secure House
consideration of H.R. 746 before the August recess. Speaker Thomas P. "Tip"
O'Neill and other members of the House Democratic leadership had reservations
about the legislative veto and Judicial review provisions of the bill. Their
problems, however, may be resolved by amendments which would bring H.R. 746 closer
to the language of S. 1080. Although chances for House floor consideration of
H.R. 746 in August are small, regulatory reform legislation may yet be enacted
in the present Congress.

PATENTS:
PATENT TERM RESTORATION BILL REPORTED
CMA has actively supported passage of patent tern restoration legislation,
H.R. 6444 and its predecessor bill H.R. 1937 (Kastenmeier-D-wlSC). On July 28,
the House Judiciary Committee favorably reported H.R. 6444 to the House.
y
H.R. 6444 would add up to 7 years of patent life to products that must
undergo government-mandated testing and review. During the mark-up of the
bill by the Judiciary Committee, a technical amendment was approved which would
designate the beneficiary of patent term restoration as "the product sponsor"
rather than "recipient of marketing approval." This change would ensure that
the Toxic Substances Control Act would be entitled to the benefits of patent
term restoration.
r
Patent term restoration legislation passed the Senate by voice vote last
year. Although H.R. 6444 has some 111 co-sponsors in the House it is currently
opposed by a coalition of organized labor, certain consumer groups, and the
generic drug industry.
The business coalition supporting early passage of H.R. 6444, including
CMA and NACA, is following the leadership of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing
Association (PMA) which supports early House passage of H.R. 6444 without further
amendment.
It is anticipated that H.R. 6444 may be brought up on the House floor under
suspension of the rules, thus requiring that at least two-thirds of the Members
present vote for the bill. Representatives of CMA member companies have been
alerted to contact Members of Congress urging them to vote for passage of
PATENTS:
EMPLOYEE INVENTOR LEGISLATION
I
Congressman Robert Kastenmeier (D-WISC) has introduced two bills that
would govern the patent rights of employed inventors. H.R. 4723 and H.R. 6635
1
would prohibit pre-invention assignment agreements between employers and employees
which transfer to the employer rights to any invention that is not an "employment *
invention" or a "service invention." H.R. 6635 also calls for "adequate
compensation for the (inventor's) service invention."
On July 29, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties
and the Administration of Justice held a public hearing to receive support testimony
from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers and from the AFL-CIO.
Additional hearings may be scheduled in the future.
The Patent and Trademark Committee is reviewing this legislation and will
develop appropriate CMA comments, but it is unlikely that legislation on this
subject could be enacted in this Congress.

By late July and August, most stata lagislaeurts had adjourned for the year.
In tha othars, suroter raeassas wart in affact. Tha following statas art expected
to reconvtna in tha fall in regular station: New Jarsay, Massachusatts,
California, Illinois, Michigan, Naw York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Several othar
statas hava hald or will hold special sassions in 1963 to addrass budgat matters
and othar pressing concerns such as unemployment and taxes.
Regulatory activity has also decreased reflecting sumer schedules.
STATE AFFAIRS PLANNING GROUP
Tha Stats Affairs Planning Group, organized in April at tha direction of
CMA's Executive Coamittee, has held numerous meetings during tha turner months and
has now completed its final report which is being presented in August to tha Executive
Comittee. Tha report focusses on:
Outlook for increased stata legislative and regulatory activity.
Currant and emerging issues.
CMA organizational needs to effectively address state affairs.
Status and role of state chemical industry councils.
Programs of allied associations.
. COMMITTEES AND TASK GROUP ACTIVITY
with slower legislative and regulatory activity during the summer, the
SASC and its task groups have concentrated on preparation for the 1983 legislative
sessions. Major activities include:
Continued planning for four regional CMA State Affairs Issues
Seminars to be held in October and November in Port Chester (NY),
Atlanta (GA), Chicago (XL), and Denver (CO). These sessions are
designed to highlight state legislative and regulatory trends and to
acquaint plant managers, regional state government relations rep­
resentatives, state trade and business associations and allied
industry representatives with chemical industry issues and CMA's
posture on them.
Profiling of individual states is continuing at SASC meetings with
Delaware, Ohio and New York having been addressed to date.

CMA 037957
i
Meetings of the Network Task Group in Minnesota and Wisconsin
during July. These meetings are designed to enhance the working
relationship between CMA and the local chemical industry in those
states while exploring the need and desirability of establishing
state chemical organizations.
t
Electronic Services Task Group completed development of service
and performance guidelines for legislative and regulatory tracking
vendors. Presentations by potential vendors for the 1983-84 session
were held on August 26-27. Once a vendor is selected, all member
companies will be invited to participate in the program.
NATIONAL STATE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS ANNUAL MEETINGS
During July and August, the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL)
i
and the National Governors Association held their annual meetings. Policy
making sessions on chemical industry issues were limited and no significant adverts :
positions emerged.
Interaction between the NCSL and the business community
continues to increase to the benefit of all parties. CMA had an exhibit at the
NCSL meeting explaining our Chemtrec activities and the industry's efforts to manag(
hazardous waste. State Affairs staff and member company representatives also
worked with NCSL staff to place industry spokesmen on hazardous materials
t
transportation and biotechnology panels.

ISSUES UPDATE
RIGHT TO KNOW
I
f
As previously reported, Wisconsin passed a worker right-to-know bill earlier
this year which contained extensive record keeping requirements. The Governor
then vetoed these provisions and his veto was recently sustained. Proponents of
right-to-know in Wisconsin may attempt to revise the law in the near future to makt
it more stringent.
i
Regulations implementing California's right-to-know law continue to work
their way through the state administrative process. If and whan they emerge, the
California law will present the most significant actual compliance problems in the *
nation.
Consnunity Riaht-to-Know continues to be extremely active in California
localitiessuch as Santa Clara, Contra Costa and Sacramento.
Initially, most
communities based their ordinances on the model proposal drafted by the State
Health Department, but the more recent ordinances are becoming more diverse.
Cincinnati (OH) finally enacted a community right-to-know bill during the summer,
while the companion proposal in Norwood (OH) was vetoed.
A new combined worker and connnunity right-to-know bill (SB 1670) has been
CMA 037968
i
introduced in New Jersey by Senator Dalton and hearings are expected in September.
CMA is working closely with the New Jersey Chemical Industry Council on their
development of appropriate comments and arguments for the upcoming debate.
An industry court challenge to West Virginia's 1981 worker right-to-know law
has been defeated.
Organized labor has made state right-to-know a priority issue for 1983. This
is evidencing itself in states like Michigan and Texas where rumours persist of
bills in preparation.
In order to meet this challenge, CMA is in the final stages
of preparing a comprehensive information packet on the right-to-know issue for use
in the states. This would supplement the issues analysis booklet which was made
available in late June.
HAZARDOUS WASTES
Hazardous waste continues .to be the most active state program area. The SASC
Hazardous Waste Disposal Task Group has been involved in the following activities:
Gearing up to address the impact in the states of the forthcoming
tort law study mandated under federal superfund.
Completion of the state by state data gathering effort on hazardous
waste.
Increased interaction with EMC task groups in policy development
and support activities for state activities.
Meeting with chemical industry and state association representatives
in Florida during June to discuss superfund developments as they
might impact that state.
The most significant legislative activity during the summer months was the
passage of a superfund bill by New York. The final bill was the product of intense
negotiations between industry and the state and between the Assembly and Senate.
The act creates a cleanup fund which is funded by a waste end fee. Third party
liability provisions were not included.
In Massachusetts, HB 6551 is likely to be considered this fall. Member
company representatives, working closely with ihe Associated Industries of
Massachusetts, have been engaged in discussions with the Administration, legislators
and environmental groups much of the year. The bill in its current form is bond
financed and contains no additional liability language.
Michigan HB 4715 has passed the House and is in the Senate pending further
action. Although the bill still requires further amendments to more closely link
it to federal superfund, it is financed from general revenues and does not contain
liability provisions.
The New Jersey Spill Fund will likely be the subject of significant amendments
this fall by Representative Lesniak. Of critical importance to the chemical industry
is the conversion of the tax from feedstock to waste end. The New Jersey CIC has
been working with Mr. Lesniak throughout the year on Spill Fund amendments.
CMA 037959
HA2ARP0US MATERIALS TRANSPORTATION
Progress has continued on drafting consensus "Good Samaritan" language
for use by a coalition of trade associations. CMA concerns center on language
to insure adequate immunity for companies responding to hazardous materials
incidents. Once consensus language has been achieved, targeting of states for
coalition action can begin in earnest. The SASC Hazardous Materials Transportation
Task Group is now working closely with Distribution Committee members to more
clearly delineate state transportation concerns and develop briefing materials
to support our positions.

State and Federal staff members of the CMA Government Relations Department

organizations on the appropriate roles of federal, state and local government in
r gulating the transportation of hazardous materials.
Althought there has been-limited legislative or regulatory activity this year 1
on prenotification requirements for hazardous materials shipments, Alabama recently j
proposed regulations requiring two weeks prior notification of the shipment of
hazardous waste. This notification would be given to several state agencies and the ^
hazardous waste facility to which the waste is being shipped.

AIR AMD WATER QUALITY
j
The SASC Environmental Task Group has been reorganized under a new chairman
and has designated priority issues in the air and water quality area including:
Groundwater/safe drinking water, water quality standards (including permitting
limitations), pre-treatment, hazardous air pollutants, controlled trading, and
state cancer policies.
The task group is working with the £MC groundwater and water quality standards
task groups on developing state issue positions and supporting materials.
Major legislative and regulatory activity includes the California Air Resource
Board proposal to severely regulate both proven and suspected toxic air contaminants
California SB 1005 would legislatively limit and control their authority to regulati
in this area. Other states with toxic air contaminant legislation include
Louisiana, Illinois, Wyoming and Texas.
Michigan SB 600 would extend the life of the state TSCA act indefinitely.

EXHIBIT M
REPORT OF DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS
RICHARD L. WILSON
INTRODUCTION;
The CMA Communications Department has one primary objective;
to increase recognition that the chemical industry is committed
to act responsibly to protect the public from the health and
safety risks of its products -- and thereby to develop public
support for the industry's public policy positions.
The depart­
ment is an integral part of the CMA umbrella function of advocacy.
CMA's communications activities are instrumental in shaping
public understanding and public support.
From this understanding
and support evolves government controls and issue-related laws
and regulations.
The department is interlocked with and suppor­
tive of every other CMA department and committee through every
step of the public policy process.
The CMA Communications Committee (made up of the top pro­
fessionals in the industry) monitors department activities and
helps in program development.
The comprehensive program includes:
ADVERTISING - The CMA two-year old advertising program produced
measurable results, as tested by Cambridge Reports in its third
wave public opinion poll earlier this year.
Almost half the
."political active" sample surveyed were aware of the CMA communi­
cation in the magazines in which the ads appeared.
Those aware
of the communications gave the industry better marks (13 percentage
points) for its efforts on waste disposal than those who were not.
For the first time since 1980, the proportion of politically
active individuals who feel the industry is concerned about the
average person's welfare (47%) nearly equals those viewing the
industry as unconcerned.
The current creative strategy -- to demonstrate the chemical
industry commitment through the personal concern of individual
industry people by showing their dual role as concerned parent and
worker -- will be used for the remainder of this calendar year.
These ten human-interest advertisements appear in Time, Newsweek,
U.S. News & World Report. Smithsonian, The New York Times. The Los
Angeles Times and The Washington Post.
In two years these ads have
generated almost a quarter of a million requests for the "key
issues" booklets and additional information.
Several new creative formats
ment beginning Jan. 1, 1983.
are being considered
for place-

NEWS SERVICES - By the middle of September 1982 , members of CMA ' s
Science Advisory Group will visit 67 cities and appear on more
than 130 television and 105 radio programs and participate in
nearly 125. newspaper interviews.
The section is coordinating
an even more aggressive media tour schedule during the current
media tour "season."
Between June 1932 and May 1983, media
tour spokespersons should visit approximately 90 primary cities.
News materials distribution includes special newsfeatures and
opinion pieces for print media; issue backgrounders; special re­
ports from ChemEcology; news releases; booklets and pamphlets;
and distribution of "The Chemical Industry Facts File."
The Section has begun production of special communications
materials on such key issues as water and hazardous waste.
The
first of these was a package of materials on water issues, de­
signed for use or adaptions by member companies at the local level.
Included in this package were: a model speech and press release;
backgrounders on water issues; suggested questions and answers for
media interviews; video film clips.
Similar packages on other
issues -- including hazardous waste disposal -- are planned.
The Section will produce a special monthly newsletter to
member-company communication personnel tracking press comments
and reports on major issues.
Another newsletter is planned for
members of the press to keep them up to date on issues.
Radio operations include: THE REPORT, a series of threeminute newsfeatures, distributed biweekly to a 1,500-station
network.
Interview topics cover hazardous waste treatment, dis­
posal and siting, energy, clean air and water issues, and other
'chemical related subjects.
One-minute newsfceds with actuality
are done when immediacy is important.
Usage rates of 1,250 to
1,650 stations encourage an increased effort in the future.
In the television area: ninety-second newsfeatures were
produced this spring on Superfund and hazardous waste techno logy,
Initial distribution was done by satellite with followup pla cement
in 84 target markets.
More newsfeatures are planned for thi s fisca 1
year on energy, environmental and economic issues.
Media contact continues and will be expanded by attends nee at
the Radio and Television News Directors Association, Nations 1
Radio Broadcasters Association and National Farm Broadcaster s
Association conventions.

i
Also, News Services is responsible for coordinating sus tained,
day-to-day contact with all members of the press and eoordin ation
of placement and development efforts by CMA*s outside public relations counsel.
The Section's media contact efforts have resulted in numerous
television and radio interviews for CMA staff executives on each of

Chicago *
SPECIAL PROJECTS - A pilot regional communications program is being
1aunehe d.
The program will be limited to one state, will be molded
to that state's communications needs and will be carried out by the
state c hemical industry council or its equivalent, along with the
support of the companies that make up the council.
Funds for the
program would be made available by CMA.
The purposes of the pilot
program are to measure the'effectiveness of the CMA communications
program in a concentrated area and to develop a model which other
states could use to attack their communications problems.
As of June, 1,080,000 key issue booklets have been printed, and
947,650 have been distributed.
Total leaflets printed were 1,472,700,
with 1,207,760 distributed.
Presentations on CMA's communications program were given to the
.public relations staff of Celanese Corporation, the Chemical Section
of the International Association of Business Communicators and the
Fairfield County, Greenwich, Conn., chapter of the Public Relations
Society of America.
Contact has been made with the public relations
committee of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, to enlist
AIChE members in CMA's communications effort.
The DuPont Company's introductory session for the CMA staff
training program was so successful that portions of the program
will be included in CMA's communications program.
This introductory session was shown to mid- and top-level
management at the Environmental Protection Agency in May.
Consumer Information: This Section is involved heavily in
organization liaison -- initiating, developing and maintaining
mutually beneficial relationships between CMA and a wide variety
of consumer, public interest, educational and other influential
organizations..
The Section pa rtieipated in the past ten annual conventions of
the American Women in Radio and Television (AWRT), with continuing
contact and serviei ng throughout the year.
CMA provides on-scene
TV and radio taping facilities for AWRT interviews with key member
company executives.

members who work with 58,000 clubs;
National Extension Homemakers Council -- 600,000 members;
American Council on Consumer Interests -- 4,300 members,
mainly consumer educators.
Education t The Catalyst Awards, begun in 1957, have honored
134 college, junior college'and high school teachers — a reservoir
of teachers supportive of the industry.
Presently, six national
and 12 regional awards are given each year.
National winners
receive $1,500, a medal and a certificate.
Begional winners
receive $500, a medal and a certificate.
The Chemical Industry
C uncils are tied closely to the high school award portion of
the program, which gives CMA a community base.
Over 1,000 requests
for information and nomination forms were received in 1982 result­

CMA has now begun its 1983
promotion throughout the United States and Canada.
AUDIO-VISUALS - "The Need to Know," a 27»j-minute film developed
in 1982 about hazardous waste disposal, is just beginning to be
distributed to organizations and schools.

Also, CMA developed three public service announcements as
part of "The Need to Know" film package; "Abandoned Waste Sites,"
"Clean water in America" and "Waste Disposal -- Incineration."
More than 700 of these spots are being mailed to public service
directors around the country for use on cable and public television.
Quantities of each with script and storyboard have been reserved
for sale to members for hand placement to their local public
television stations.
"Doing Something," a 21-minute, 16 mm. film on the on-job
activities, of specialists in health and safety areas, has been

"The Chemical Balance" is a 12-minute, 35 mm. audio-visual
presentation of chemical industry contributions to people, the
nation and its management of risk.
A free copy of the slide show
was given to each member company.
PUBLICATIONS - CMA News strives to keep its 5,000 readers in
member companies informed of Association activities.
Increasingly,
the publication is going behind the news to explain the significance
of current issues.
During the past year, four-page backgrounders
have covered the CMA/EPA Five Plant Study, TSCA, the environmen­
talist movement and natural gas decontrol.
A quarterly report
summarizes CMA activities and future plans.
ChemEcology keeps important external publics informed about
the industry's efforts to improve the environment and the workplace.
Its 30,000 readers get the other side of the story that seldom
appears in the public media-.
Background papers are prepared on vital environmental issues
to keep the press and other interested publics aware of CMA' s
positions and progress.
Recent backgrounders explain CMA's posi­
tion on the need to update the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.

Chairman Callahan distributed to those present a revised SPAC charter,
Exhibit G, to replace the one contained in Appendix 1, page 5, of the com­
mittee report previously circulated to the Board. This, along with certain
CMA 037969
2203
other items, will be presented to the Executive Committee for approval.
He emphasized that the chemical-specific programs conducted by the com­
mittee perform front line service for the industry in addressing product, en­
vironmental, and worker safety issues and their relationship to government
relations.
Referring to various handouts, he then described the several roles of
the committee as contained in the "Purpose" section of the charter; briefly
discussed the reorganization of SPAC; and concluded with an overview of its
future activities.
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS GROUP
Dr. Blair expanded on his report, Exhibit H, by reviewing the origin
and history of I AG and discussing the various problems being addressed by the
group on behalf of the U.S. chemical industry. He concluded with a plea for
Board support for IAG activities which can have a major impact on the inter­
national movement of chemical substances, and will require, on occasion, the
presence of IAG representatives in other parts of the world.
The Board adjourned until 9:00 a.m., Tuesday, January 11.
Tuesday, January 11, 1983
MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING
The minutes of the October 5, 1982, Board meeting were approved as
distributed.
TREASURER'S REPORT
Mr. Herrman's report is attached as Exhibit I.
Additionally, he advised
that:
e
Current year expenses continue to be controlled at or below the
level in the reduced operating budget.
e
The communications assessment, reduced to the 20% level, was
mailed the first of December. Through January 5, 1983, pay­
ments have been received from 107 of our 181 members totalling
$975,000. Dues will be slightly above budget since we have re­
ceived payments from two members whose payments were in doubt at
the time the amended budget and contingency plan were prepared.
e
Returns in response to the October preliminary survey of calendar
year 1982 sales indicated that CMA dues would be down by 5-6%
which is the amount estimated in the contingency plan.
CMA 037970
2204
The request for actual calendar year 1982 sales has been mailed.
The return of this information at the earliest possible date
would be appreciated. The preliminary budget should be mailed
to the Finance and Executive Committees about February 21 for
review at the March 7 and 8 meetings. The Board will be asked
to review and approve a proposed budget and funding at the April 5
meeting.
REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Chairman Fernandez reported the following matters taken up by the Execu­
tive Committee the preceding day:
e
Special Programs Advisory Committee
Accepted the recommendations
of the Special Programs Committee that: the existence of SPAC be ex­
tended for a year, Exhibit J; the modified committee charter, Ex­
hibit G, distributed to the Board at its previous session, be approved
as proposed; and the proposed program on alkanolamines, Exhibit K,
be approved. The proposed name change for the Biomedical and Environ­
mental Special Programs Division was not accepted.
e
Hazardous Waste Management
Heard a presentation of a proposed
long-range plan by the Hazardous Haste Strategy Group on which the
chairmen of CMA's Environmental Management, Communications, and Govern­
ment Relations Committees serve. The program's objective is to turn,
the negative public perception to a more favorable view of the way the
chemical industry is handling waste management. Each member of the
Executive committee, following his company's study of the plan, will
respond to Mr. Roland. The HWSG, after being informed of the views of
the Executive Committee, will then submit for the latter's further
consideration a set of specific proposals.
e
Public Compensation
Heard a presentation on the public compensation issue by the Strategic Options Work Group and the Data Develop­
ment work Group. It was decided to continue the existence of the SOWS,
augmented with additional skills. The DDWG will be placed on hold and
the chairman, Dr. Karrh will be added to the SOWG. Data collection
will be suspended pending a resolution of specific strategy alternatives
to be prepared, not later than the end of February, for Executive Com­
mittee consideration.
i
Meanwhile it was agreed that it was appropriate for CMA to: support
the Kasten bill which would strengthen the present tort system; not
support the asbestos bill and work to eliminate the provision permit­
ting inclusion of the chemical industry;
press EPA to develop the
data base that would scope the dimensions of the health problem which
may be related to waste disposal sites; and build coalitions with
other organizations and industry groups.
In order to position ourselves more effectively to address not only the
public compensation issue but also ocher issues which may arise in the
Congress, Mr. Rooke was appointed to coordinate efforts, working with
the CMA Government Relations Committee and staff, to establish an in­
dustry-wide grassroots network.
CMA 037971
2205
Recognizing the importance of speaking with a united voice the attached
statement, Exhibit L, prepared at the direction of the Executive Com­
mittee was distributed to those present for use in responding to questions
regarding the CMA position on public compensation.
RESIGNATION OF DIRECTOR
Chairman Simeral announced the resignation of Mr. Orell T. Collins,
Director of the Association, effective November 17, 1982.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded,
it was
VOTED: That H. H. Clark, President,
CEO, Nalco Chemical Company, be elected
to fill the vacancy on the Board and the
Finance Committee through May 31, 1983.
ASSOCIATION ACTIVITIES
Report of the President
e
Mr. Roland reviewed the budget process at CMA; the development
of a system of prioritization which has identified about 12 major
issue areas within which the Association operates; and the attempt
which will be made to overlay this on the budget process for fiscal
year 1983-84.
e
Because CMA's allocation of guaranteed spaces for the Annual Meet­
ing at The Greenbrier, June 9-10, has been reduced by 100 from last
year, all member companies are urged to register as soon as possible.
The cutoff date for registrations is April 1.
e
The Board meeting next following the Annual Meeting is September
12-13 at the Cloister, Sea Island Georgia. The Semiannual Meet­
ing is in New York City at the New York Hilton Hotel November 7-8.
Member Relations
Mr. Peterson's report is attached as Exhibit M. Distributed to
those present as a matter of information were copies of a survey
of chemical industry participation in state CICs and the Local
Leadership Newsletter which reports the activities of state organi­
zations .
Report of Technical Director
In expanding on her report, Exhibit N, Dr. Cox highlighted the
advocacy CMA is pursuing with other organizations on environmental
matters. She urged that company people be encouraged to join local
conservation groups so that the facts can be brought to light and
thereby promote a better understanding and establish a more balanced
public view of environmental issues.
CMA 037972

Report of Director of Government Relations
Mr. Stover's report is attached as Exhibit 0.
Report of Director of Communications
Expanding on his report, Exhibit P, Mr. Wilson advised that CMA
is m search of positive, dramatic, human interest stories from
the chemical industry that could be developed into television
scripts. He distributed to those present a flyer outlining this
project and solicited special storylines.
During discussion following Mr. Wilson's report, Mr. Sella emphasized
the importance of stockholders as a key public for CMA's communica­
tions program. Alluding to several million who could be reached in
this manner, he volunteered to work with CMA staff in organizing a
program to urge member company decision makers to undertake stock­
holder mailings.

OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH COMMITTEE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CMA's Occupational Safety and Haalth Committee (OSHC) has
baan charged by the Board of Directors to develop and recom­
mend policies on occupational health, slant safety, fire pro­
tection and precautionary labeling.
Committee and task group
members participated in a debate on health and safety issues
affecting the chemical Industry.
During the past year, the committee met its goals on ma­
jor regulatory proposals; educated the Occupational Safety and
Health Adminatration (OSHA) in health and safety regulatory
reform; publicised responsible workplace practices employed
throughout our industry; participated in voluntary standard­
setting organisations; and worked with congressional staff on
issues of concern to the legislature.
Some major accomplish­
ments of particular note include;
e
Convincing OSHA that its labeling objectives could be
met through effective hasard communications programs
already in use.
The current regulation is a signifi­
cant savings over the $14 billion estimated to be the
cost for chemical industry compliance with a labeling
rule proposed by the last OSHA administration.
e
"Selling" OSHA on use of balanced-performance stand­
ards.
The committee drafted a model standard on
hasardous materials demonstrating these principles.
The committee also sponsored a seminar for a large
group of Agency standard writers on how to prepare
performance standards.
e
Participating actively in the revision of the Agency's
carcinogen policy, through written and oral presenta­
tions to OSHA.
Its advocacy of sound proposals on health and safety
matters won the committee professional respect and rapport
among OSHA policymakers.
This relationship has been built on
solid and timely responses to the Agency's questions and
requests.
By maintaining the Agency's respect and confidence,
OSHC has been able to provide insight and important industry
perspective to the OSHA Adminatration as it develops regula­
tory proposals.
While occupational health issues receive much of the hype
and attention devoted to workplace practices, safety issu s
represent a substantial component of OSHA's regulatory pr gram.
During the past year, the OSHC advocacy program on
workplace safety was expanded to balance its health issues
programs.
The committee w rked with OSHA to devel p a tar­
geted safety inspect! ns proposal, and bolstered th

The coaaitte* worked
with CMA's Sovernaent Relations Departaent to provide the
Association's views on key issues, including hazard coeauaicatlons and cytogenetic screening, to congressional eonaittees

safety probleas elained by labor and public interest groups.
The ehealcal industry's safety record — tops by the Rational
Safety Council -- serves as a vehicle to carry our views on
specific regulatory and legislative interests.
During the coning year, OSHC will further strengthen both
its health and safety advocacy prograas.

To aoet these challenges, the eoanitte* will look for th*

remarks to cma board of directors
Chairman, Occupational Safety and Health Committee
January 10, 1983
During the years 1980 and 81, and 1981-82, under the leadership of Tom
Evans, the OSH Committee of CMA was re-organized, re-energized, and became
recognized by government agencies as a force for industry representation
and cooperative effort. With this as a foundation we decided to look at the
tasks for the year 1982-83. He decided that, initially, we should re-evaluate
the current OSHA administration's attitude, establish cooperative, nonduplicative efforts with other inter-industry groups, establish strong communica­
tions with other CMA committees whose work overlapped and influenced ours, and
consolidate and/or eliminate task groups where feasible.
The attitude of the current OSHA administration was succinctly made clear
to us by a communication which we received from Mark Cowan, the then-Deputy
Assistant Secretary for OSHA. He said, "...After years of stating that industry
if given the opportunity is well equipped to address workplace problems, industry
now, in the OSHA area has an opportunity which may never again be repeated. The
opportunity exists for corporate America to double and re-double their efforts
in this field so as to prove it can be done without undue government interference.
The chance to demonstrate conclusively that companies sincerely care about their
workforce is available. Should this opportunity be missed, or worse, should
corporations through a de-emphasis of safety and health programs give credence
to the allegation that the only concern in the boardroom is profit, the old OSHA
of days past will rise from the grave with a vengeance. Now is not the time for
corporations to let down their guard nor to relax measures which have resulted in
gains in the safety and health area."
He believe that this gives us a clear indication that the current OSHA
administration will continue in the vein that they have been and that they are
open for cooperative efforts from industry groups.
He are redoubling our efforts to establish closer and more efficient coopera­
tion with a number of industry groups. Since numbers of our health and safety
people serve on task forces with diverse organizations, we're attempting to determine
who should have the lead role in responding to individual OSHA regulations in an
effort to minimize the time, travel and effort required of the members of your
company on these various committees. The organization deemed most appropriate to
prepare the primary response does so; the other organizations then adapt the response
to their needs.
He are in the process of eliminating some task groups and consolidating others
and will reduce the number of task groups from 12 to 6 or 7 in an effort to stream­
line the work of the OSH com&ittee and again reduce the time and travel required
by task group members. However, major efforts will continue in the area of
carcinogens, reproductive hazards, respirators, targeting health inspections,
industrial noise, performance standards, and hazards connunications, federal and
and state and consunity.
CMA 037976
2
We have been involved with a number of activities with the government
agencies involved with health and safety matters, a major theme which runs
throughout our responses and testimony related to all OSHA standards and
regulations is the theme. Performance Standards. We are constantly advising
OSHA to write their standards with the goals and objectives desired, the
general processes and/or strategy, including work practices to reach the
goal, and to minimize the specifications in the materials and equipment.
A major effort has been carried out by the Safety Standards Group in
this area. They have written a model standard for hazardous substances in the
workplace in performance language. At the request of the Assistant Secretary
for OSHA they have used this document in a training session for standards writers
in an effort to educate them in the writing of performance standards. This has
been well received by OSHA and the task group has received a letter of thanks
from the Director of OSHA for their activity. It is our hope that with this
training effort and interaction with OSHA, the new standards will be written
in true performance language.
Another significant work effort with OSHA has led to the adoption of the
Safety Inspection Targeting System for Routine Safety inspections. This enables
OSHA to focus their inspections on high-hazard industries where they'll do the
most good, and enables those of us with good safety records to be free of routine
safety inspections.
Work is ongoing to apply a similar methodology for health inspections, and_
recently two of our members attended an OSHA workshop where an effort was being
made to devise such a method. The method recommended by the CMA members appears
to have been favorably received by other members of industry, the unions, and
the governmental agencies. We shall continue with efforts in this area over the
near future.
Another major effort was carried out on the standard for hazards communica­
tion. This culminated in testimony by a four-member panel of CMA on June 17, 1982.
/3ur work in this area was completed when post-hearing comments were filed in
September, 1982. As stated previously, we're hopeful that a federal standard in
this area will reempt a myriad of state standards which currently exist from
being enforced and also prevent the writing of standards by states and communities
which have not yet done so.
We presented the argument that OSHA has the authority to preempt states
standards with a federal standard on the basis that a myriad of state standards
will present an undue burden on interstate commerce.
This brings me to the area of States Activities Task Group which is doing
yeoman work to track and respond to an increasing number of state and local initia­
tives dealing with hazardous substances under worker "right to know” and community
"right to know” statutes. It is not clear whether the promulgation of a federal
hazardous communication standard will supersede the current states statutes but
the minimum we hope to achieve is to reduce the proliferation of further state
and community statutes in this area. It is worthy of note that the State of
California has already announced their position that there is no Federal override
so long as the state statute is "as stringent as" the federal. Further, although
the federal statute may affect "worker right to know" laws from proliferating
we are unsure as to what effect it will have on "community right to know" standards.
Considerable work remains to be done in this area in conjunction with the
legislative affairs committee.
CMA 037977
The issue of "managing reproductive risk in the workplace" deserves some
comment. The reproductive risk issue continues to be active with legislators
and in the news media. As you are probably aware, a recent court decision in the
"Olin case"upheld the concept that prohibiting a fertile female from working in
an evnironment which is harmful to the fetus does not constitute discrimination
on the basis of sex, but is a legitimate work practice. C.M.A. has had a lead
position on this issue for some time and the OSH Committee will be conducting
a conference on "Managing Reproductive Risk in the Workplace" on May 11 and 12,
1983. It will focus on a review of the most recent information in this field
with emphasis on how various companies are addressing it. Attendees will be
restricted to C.M.A. members from various line and staff disciplines.
In the latter half of 1983, conferences will be conducted on "Worker Educatiorf'
and on "Process Safety Analysis".
In addressing the future the committee determined that it needed a better
mechanism for "picking and choosing" from the myriad of issues which ones it
should most appropriately address. In an effort to do this, we determined that
we would look at the issues presented to us from the viewpoint of the likelihood
of their occurrence and their potential impact on CMA member companies, issu s
will be submitted to the OSH Committee by the redesigned Future Issues Task
Group, members of the committee, and the general membership of CMA.
in conclusion, the OSH Committee recognizes that the problem of worker,
community and product liability which is currently being addressed by the
Executive Committee will be a very significant issue for federal and state
legislators for some time to come, and will be intertwined with hazardous
substances communication, worker "right to know" and community "right to know"
regulations.

CHEMICAL REGULATIONS ADVISORY COMMITTEE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Th« Chemical Regulations Advisory Committee (CRAC) has
developed policies on governmental control of chemicals at the
point of manufacture primarily by guiding SPA's implementation
of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
TSCA is compre­
hensive and significantly affects not only our industry, but
also parts of society dependent on chemical products.
The
Act's pervasive impact, therefore, makes effective implementa­
tion a key to managing the regulatory burden on the production
of chemical products.
Since TSCA was enacted in 1 976, CRAC
has guided EPA's implementation of the Act mainly bv comment­
ing on, or proposing major rules.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implemented
very little of the Act before 1981.
However, because of the
industry's persistent interaction with EPA, many reasonable
procrams are now in place or have been proposed.
For example,
several final rules on existing chemicals are considerably
less burdensome then they might have been without CRAC's ef­
forts; negotiated voluntary tasting is a reality; the premanu^
facture notification (PMN) program is functioning well with
many PMNs filed on CMA's PMN form, and SPA has proposed a PMN
exemption program for certain chemicals -- largely in response*
to a CMA petition.
Future CMA concerns should focus on how the remaining
sections of TSCA are implemented.
For example, the chemical
industry needs to work closely with EPA to ensure that the
Agency's follow-up programs on new and existing chemicals are
implemented soundly.
The next 12 months will be a momentous period for CRAC.
Me have received many signals that TSCA reauthorisation and
oversight activities will be particularly challenging.
ready, public interest groups, such as the Natural Resources
Defense Council, have announced they will push to amend TSCA
so that it will require base set testing of chemieals.
It is
paramount that CMA be aware of and effectively deal with both
national and international attempts to modify the Act.
If the
chemical industry plans to survive these uncertain economic
times and flourish in the future, TSCA must be implemented and
administered fairly and reasonably.
we must he prepared to
meet any challenge that would create additional, and unneces­
sarily burdensome requirements.
To prepare for those critical activities, CRAC initiated a
survey to assess what the. industry has done and is doing to
reduce unreasonable risks to health and the environment.
CRAC
plans to use the survey information in the reauthorixation and
CMA 037979
2
oversight hearings and la aupportinc CMA'* positions on rea­
sonable control of chaaicala.
The Information should also b«
valuable in supporting othsr CMA advoaacy programs on
environmental issues.
CRAC is committed to representing CMA's interests to spa as it
implements the remaining sections of T3CA, and to work with
the Agency now and la the future as it administers the law.
Furthermore CRAC is prepared to dewote its attention and
resources beyond TSCA, as neoessary* to moot the board's
purpose*

remarks to cma board of directors
By E. Hamilton Hurst
Chairman, Chemical Regulations Advisory Committee
January 10, 1983
It seems like only a few months ago, I had the pleasure of addressing this
group to outline the activities of your Chemical Regulation Advisory Committee
(CRAC). In the interim, we have had a busy but a very productive year. I am
pleased to be here once again to highlight for you what has taken place and
to outline our plans for the coming year.
In your pre-meeting books, you will find a detailed summary of our activities.
This has been prepared by the CMA staff which has been of great assistance to
us throughout the year. Z will not cover all of the items included in this
summary as I want to spend my time here discussing the major events and our
future activities.
There are a few key events that did take place over the last 12 months which
deserve a quick highlight. When we talked last, the EPA had, frankly, imple­
mented only a portion of what TSCA will ultimately be. There was much crit­
icism of the Agency's failure to implement TSCA. The events of 1982 have
changed that and a great portion of the proposed rules have been finalized
and put into place.
Reporting Requirements of TSCA
Production, use and exposure data were required on 250' chemicals
by November, 1982.
Health and safety studies were required on 168 chemicals by
December, 1982.
Testing
For 1982, the court mandated a schedule for EPA to respond with a
decision to test or not to test 13 XTC-designated chemicals, the
EFA has made those decisions in 11 cases with 2 others imminent.
In addition to the court ordered schedule, EPA has made decisions
on 8 other ITC-designated chemicals.
Chemical Control
Rules for regulating PCB's in electrical equipment and excluding
CMA 037981
some closed or controlled waste manufacturing systems were
finalized. A third PCB regulation (scheduled now for December,
1983) will address all other processes which generate incidental
New Chemicals
Some 2,000 new chemicals have gone through the PMN process with
only a handful being regulated. The SPA reports that approxi­
mately 50% of the PMN's are of such low risk that they can
complete this review in about 15 days. Only 3% warrant extensive
review exceeding 45 days time, less than 1% have resulted in
either SPA orders or were withdrawn by the submitter because of
questions on risks associated with the chemical. The Agency has
responded to CMA's petition to exempt certain small-volume chem­
icals, site-limited intermediates and polymers from full PMN
review. Based on results of their PMN review experiences, EPA
proposed exemption rules in August, 1982 which should finalize
by mid-year 1983.
Since the events I have outlined are EPA actions and regulations at that, you
might reasonably ask — "Well, what has CRAC done to earn our pay — the EPA
seems to have done all the work — and what we have gotten are regulations."
I can proudly say — we have done a lot. CMA has had major impact in each
of these areas....to our industry's benefit.
In the Reporting Area
For production, use and exposure data reporting, the original EPA
proposals covered 2,300 chemicals - about 10 times what was covered
in the final rule. CMA was successful in convincing EPA they should
ask only for the amount of data they could reasonably handle and
digest on a current basis. We were able to avoid data gathering
for data gathering's sake.
The Health and Safety Data
in the finalization of these rules, we were successful in reducing
the amount of data to be submitted, we were able to shorten the
historical time period for which each company must review their
records and submit data.
Testing
In the testing area, production, use and test data information
CMA 037982
input from the individual companies has resulted in a number of
decisions by the EPA to not require testing of ITC-designated
chemicals. In other instances, companies have been able to use
"negotiations" to reach agreement with the Agency on what testing
is most reasonably required. CRAC has promoted the acceptance of
the "negotiated testing" concept as a practical substitute for
formal "test rules" under TSCA. Negotiated test agreements save
our resources and result in testing programs which focus only on
the most significant needs.
New Chemicals
The experience EPA has now achieved from processing 2,000+ PMN's,
has allowed us to isolate facts from this data to demonstrate and
convince the EPA that exemptions to the PMN system were needed,
justified and would help both industry and the Agency. While the
Agency would always like to have more information and test data
submitted on the PMN, they have developed review procedures using
PMN information and structural- similarity studies with which they
are satisfied they can carry out their responsibilities for PMN
review under TSCA, It was very refreshing to hear an EPA spokesman
at a recent presentation of their PMN system remark — "We recog­
nize that the PMN can be a terrible burden on new product innova­
tion. There is no way we should expect the development of complete
test data on each new chemical at this stage of their development,
nor do we need it to make the assessments required by TSCA." - Here
again, the EPA has heard us, We've come a long way baby! at least
with TSCA. The EPA is getting practical.
While we have our successes, we still have some major obstacles in front of
us an important priorities for 1983.
Oversight hearings - scheduled for early 1983.
Final PMN rules - scheduled by the second quarter.
Final PMN exemption rules - scheduled by the third quarter.
The development of EPA's approach to assign priority to and to regulate
existing chemicals.
These forthcoming events dictate our immediate plans for the future and it will
require our close attention to solidify our present gains and to continue the
implementation of TSCA as a workable law.
The most significant of our future activities is also the one we have to tackle
CMA 037983
first — the oversight hearings. While I had a rather uneventful experi­
ence of testifying before a Senate Subcommitte on Toxic Substances and
Environmental Oversight back in August of 1982, the real game will be
played early this Spring, perhaps in February or March in both the House
and the Senate.
we expect the oversight hearings to be particularly tough as our opponents
seek to turn around some of the successes we have achieved. Specifically,
in the House before Congressman Florio's Subcommittee we expect to see the
following issues to be pushed by the Environmentalists..
TSCA should be amended to require testing of new chemicals
since industry is providing test data in less than 50% of
the cases.
The Agency should not be allowed to accept negotiated testing
agreements as a substitute for test rules since these agreements
are unenforceable.
The ability of the Agency to regulate chemicals under TSCA is
constrained by the need to balance risks and benefits and make
findings of unreasonable risk. This requires that TSCA be
amended to reduce these constraints.
The environmentalists have indicated they intend to open TSCA for amend­
ments and we believe Congressman Plorio will be willing to listen. Congress
man Florio has already commissioned OTA (Office of Technology Assessment U.S. Congress) to make a study on the adequacy of data submitted on a PMJ.
'In addition, he commissioned the GAO (General Accounting Office) to study
EPA's PMN review process to include procedural and policy differences
between EPA's and EEC's approach. The Senate has commissioned GAO (General
Accounting Office to study the merits of negotiated testing versus testing
rules.
So, our work is cut out for us, within CRAC we have established an Ad Hoc
Oversight Committee chaired by myself with Carl Umland of Exxon as ViceChairman. This consul ttee, made up of our task group chairman and coordi­
nated with the Government Relations Committee through our "Key man,"
Jerry Kinney of Onion Carbide, is preparing position papers on these issues
and others. We plan to enlist the help of our friends on the House Sub­
committee to counter the environmental leanings of Congressman Florio and
others on the committee. We will welcome any and all help we can get as
we enter this oversight activity. Our objective is to avoid damaging
amendments to TSCA.
While we expect our major confrontation with the environmentalists will be
in the House, the climate in the Senate is also not the most desirable.
Though the Senate Subcommittee is controlled by Republicans, the specific
members have environmental interests and we will again need to be well
prepared.
As part of our preparation for oversight, and for use in other public arenas,
we are completing our survey on "chemical company activity to reduce unrea­
sonable risk." This survey, which your executive committee approved at our
Fall meeting in Chicago should provide valuable information for use at the
hearings to demonstrate that industry on its own has taken the action needed
to reduce unreasonable risks and that the "Spirit of TSCA" is working.
Furthermore, the data should help us indicate that significant changes to the
law are unnecessary.
We have over 100 companies participating in the survey so we believe the
results will be creditable. Initial results appear to be following the
pattern seen in the pilot survey which we completed early in 1982. The
companies have sent in their responses and our contractor is tabulating the
information for us now. We expect to have an initial tabulation of the
results by January 19th for our review. Of course we will forward a copy
of the results of this survey to you prior to announcing it to the public.
We expect we will be ready for public release around February 1st.
Getting back to the regulatory side of our operations, the Agency has
announced they intend to publish final PMN rules by April, 1983 and are
preparing an active follow-up program for certain new chemicals. We have
reason to believe the Agency has again heard us and will "back off" from
the extensive PMN forms originally proposed. While we have urged the Agency
not to adopt a "form," we expect they will require one to encourage consis­
tency and organization of the PMN data. We will be endeavoring to again
provide impact in the development of the final form.
We expect to follow-up activity will be based upon the implementation of
Significant New Use Rules (SNURS) and the various reporting rules for
chemicals in commercial production. We could see some of these follow-up
programs early this year. We expect these will be used in only a handful
of cases but we are actively working to assure the criteria used to initiate
this activities are acceptable.
The PMN exemption proposal put forth by the EPA follows, for the most part,
the concepts offered by CMA in its petition. Where the Agency has proposed
more extensive and burdensome approaches, we have reacted through comments,
testimony and face-to-faee discussion to offer alternatives which will
achieve the EPA's and industry's goals. We expect final rules on exemptions
by mid-year and our New Chemial Task Group now chaired by Jerry Hapka of
DuPont will be working to bring these to fruition.
CMA 037985
The last major regulatory objective under TSCA will be the establishment
of proper criteria to select and give priority to those chemicals which
may become the subject of regulation. This is a part of TSCA under which
the Agency is still under criticism since there have been no final rules
regulating chemicals under TSCA other than PCS's which was written into
the Act itself. The Agency is working to develop a process for existing
chemicals now. Zn the past year we established under CRAC a new task group
chaired by Fred Hoerger of Dow to work with the SPA on this process develop­
ment. There are 3 or 4 chemicals that SPA is now reviewing and we could
expect one or more of these to be the subject of proposed rules by the end
of 1983 or early 1984 controlling some aspects of production, processing,
distribution, use or disposal. He believe we are in a position to make this
process a reasonable one as it is developed.
In summary, 1982 saw major advances in the implementation of TSCA and major
progress on the part of the EPA in making the final rules and procedures
much more reasonable. CRAC, through its 15 active members and the excellent
CMA staff support we have received, has been instrumental in achieving this.
We said last year that a window existed with this Administration to make
significant advances in implementing TSCA in a reasonstie way. we have gotten
number of rules through that window.'
1983 will present new challenges, the most critical of which Will be our
oversight hearings where we must hold our ground and solidify the gains we
have made. We still believe TSCA is a workable law when implemented in a
reasonable and timely fashion. We will need to demonstrate that it is
working and that the goals of TSCA to reduce unreasonable risk are being
achieved. We will not seek to reopen TSCA for asiendment, however, should this
occur, we are prepared to offer our suggested improvements.
I have had the pleasure of chairing the CRAC Comittee for the past year and a
half and will complete this assignment and my fourth year of CRAC membership
in June. I thank you for the support you have given to your committee and to
me personally. The work of CRAC was needed. CRAC has been and continues to
be effective in achieving industry's goals to make TSCA a workable law as it
is implemented.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In 1982/ CMA, through the Patent and Trademark Committee (PATC), has been
an instrumental voice in providing industry input to the U.S. Government m the
development of its patent policies at home and abroad- The PATC has also
advocated CMA positions, as appropriate, directly with foreign authorities.
During the past year, CMA, through the PATC, has obtained increased
visibility and respect in the industrial property rights area. Congressional
and Agency staff persons solicit CMA's comments on pending domestic legis­
lation, anticipated regulatory changes, and international negotiations.
Committee members, in addition to preparing written comments for submission
by CMA, have, for example, testified before the Patent and Trademark Office
on a proposed rulemaking and have served as industry advisors to the Diplomatic
Conferences held this year in Geneva, Switzerland on proposed revisions
to the international treaty on industrial property rights (commonly known as
the "Paris Convention"). In all these forums, the Committee has stressed
the importance of strengthened patent protection to technological advancement
and economic recovery.
And, perhaps as significant in this time of economic difficulties, the
Patent and Trademark Committee has fulfilled its 1982 activities with almost
no expenditures for outside assistance, either technical or legal. With
one minor exception, all written comments were prepared and advocacy activities
carried out by Committee members, other designated CMA member company
representatives, and CMA staff. We also do not anticipate any major outside
assistance expenses curing 1983.
Finally, the PATC believes that an important part of its role lies in
communication with all CMA member companies, both through the CMA Board
of Directors and through other member company representatives, on develop­
ments in the industrial property rights area. We, therefore, work to
increase awareness of the importance of these issues among member companies
and, in return, to obtain an understanding of member company positions on
these issues. Armed with this information, the Committee is able to
formulate proposed CMA positions for Board approval. In this communications
role in 1982, the PATC has informed the Board of a number of patent issues,
including Paris Convention developments; has held an open Committee meeting;
and has communicated with member companies through such mechanisms as Action
Advisories and newsletters.
This Executive Summary has been excerpted from page two of the following
Report, the section entitled "Patent and Trademark Committee Activities and
Accomplishments, Overview." .

REMARKS TO CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
By Roy H. Massengill
Chairman, Patent and Trademark Committee
January 10, 1983
The year 1982 has marked three major milestones in the reform and
improvement of the patent system better to meet the needs of fostering techno­
logical progress. Procedures are now in place to obtain a higher quality patent
before issuance, to obtain less costly determinations of patent validity
without expensive litigation and to obtain more certain application of the
patent laws in litigation. Progress has been more difficult in changing the
substantive law to restore a full patent term for products whose introduction
has been subject to regulatory delay. Unfavorable changes in domestic federal
law to regulate contracts with employed inventors have been averted, so far.
Attempts by developing countries to force early consulsory licensing or can­
cellation of patents have also been put off, so far. The year 1983 will bring
renewed discussion on all three of these substantive matters: patent
term restoration, employed inventors contracts, and compulsory licensing of
patents in third world countries. It will also bring, we hope, renewed
discussion of two changes in the substantive U.S. patent law regarding inter­
national trade, and renewed discussion about interference practice, inventorship
in the corporate setting and other matters. Your CMA Patent and Trademark
Committee will work to help formulate and enunciate CMA policy on these issues
and to communicate with CMA member companies on developments in these areas.
I. PATENT REFORM
A. Examination. Many cospanies can expect patent costs to go up next
year because of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) fee increases,
effective October 1, 1982, that represent the first fee increase in almost
20 years. In combination with new management at the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, the hiring of more Examiners, better Examiner training, better main­
tenance of the search files and an overdue trial of automated searching,
these fees will, we hope, bring a steady improvement in the system under
which patents are granted and trademarks are registered in the U.S. We
expect several procedural changes to be discussed next year that will enable
the additional resources to be used to shorten the period it takes to
issue a patent or register a trademark, while reducing the proportion that
are issued improperly because of such curable errors as prior art references
missing from the patent examiner's search file.
B. Alternative to Litigation. The reexamination system now in place is
designed to provide a quick and low-cost administrative procedure to have an
issued patent reviewed by the PTO for patentability against printed prior
art raising a new question of validity. While the courts seem, in general,
willing to defer to the Patent Office on such issues, the use of reexamination
has been less than had been predicted by its proponents. Perhaps more time is
needed for patent owners and others to use this system more regularly as an
alternative to litigation, in any event, recent legislation has opened up
issues of patent validity and infringement as proper subjects for arbitration.
1
CMA 037988
2
By next year, we should begin to know whether or not this new alternative to
expensive patent litigation will be used widely. Arbitration may be the
preferred route for deciding if sensitive commercial activity invalidates a
patent on either prior use or best mode grounds, or avoids infringement for
technical reasons which neither party wishes to be made public. Reexamination
will remain the non-litigation alternative for dealing with printed prior art.
C. Litigation Improvement. A major change in 1982 has been the creation
of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has appellate jurisdiction
over all cases arising under the patent laws, as well as over appeals from the
Patent and Trademark Office. By developing a uniform body of interpretations,
it is hoped that this court will eliminate forum shopping in patent litigation.
Because the Court was formed by the merger of (1) one court with experience
in appeals from the Patent and Trademark Office and from the International
Trade Commission and (2) another court with experience in claims against the
Government, this new Appeals Court can be expected to show a high level of
understanding of the technical and commercial significance of patents.
II. LEGISLATION CARRIED OVER
A. Patent Term Restoration. The biggest disappointment this year has
been the failure to enact legislation extending the term of patents whose
effective term has been eroded by years of regulatory delay. As Dick
Waterman reported to you last year, the CMA Patent and Trademark Committee had a
principal role in drafting this legislative proposal. Following the lead
of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, we hope to push this bill
into law during the next Congress; the press of other business and opposition
by key Senators and Congressmen prevented this bill from being enacted in
spite of majority support in both Houses.
B. Employed Inventors' Agreements. Two attempts were made last year
to regulate by Federal law the contractual relationship between employed
, inventors and their enployers. We expect these efforts to intensify next year,
particularly in the area of defining fields in which the employee's inventions
are assigned to his employer and other fields in which the employer has
no investment. The topic of statutory compensation to employees when their
inventions are used commercially will also be raised. These issues will
be monitored closely,and reconmiendations for CMA positions will be made,
if Congress seems likely to act on either proposal.
III. INTERNATIONAL - 1982 DEVELOPMENTS
The major developments on the international front have been recent attempts
by developing countries to revise the Paris Convention, the basic international
treaty regarding patent filing, to permit a country to order cancellation or
compulsory licensing of a patent not locally worked within a few years.
While the U.S. Government has been supportive of industry in opposing these
proposals, we have had to work with our counterparts in Europe to encourage
their governments to take a similar stand.
CMA 037989

3
1983
A. Changes in the U.S. Substantive Law Regarding Extraterritorial
Application of U.S. Patents. There are two provisions of U.S. patent law
which differ from the laws of most other countries in a way that places a
U.S. manufacturer at a competitive disadvantage in international trade, when
his sole patent protection relates to improved processes for making known
products, as is often the case in the chemical industry, he cannot use the
courts to challenge those practicing the process abroad and importing the
product. His remedy before the International Trade Commission has many other
conditions, unrelated to patent issues, that he would not have to meet in a
normal civil action. An analogous provision of U.S. law provides no effective
remedy for the holder of a patent on a machine having several components
against another party who manufactures the consonants in the U.S. for
assembly abroad. We will be reviewing proposed legislation next year to
remedy both of these problems.
B. Changes in Interference Practice. We will also be reviewing
proposals to reform the interference practice used by the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to determine priority among inventors claiming the same
invention in order to expedite these determinations. A symptom of problems
in this area is that a patent is now issuing on crystalline polypropylene that
could be enforceable until the end of the century.
C. Other Issues. Other areas that we plan to review are the treatment
of related inventions by different combinations of inventors in the orporate
setting; uniform policies for ownership of patents, data and software
resulting from government-funded research; and the possible implementation
of the examination chapter of the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
CONCLUSION
The current political climate represents an unprecedented opportunity
to reform the entire patent system in the U.S. to make patents reliable
assets for investors in technology. The increased costs and delays asso­
ciated with bringing innovative products and processes to market make the
need for enforceable patents and affordable enforcement procedures more
urgent. We hope that 1983 brings continued improvements in these areas
domestically, together with renewed efforts to prevent an erosion of the
patent system in the international context.

SUMMARY OF
INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMITTEE
REPORT TO CMA BOARD
January 10, 1983
with chemical exports deerseeing and isports increasing in a world
swinging toward nor* protectionism, tha mission of CMA's International
Trade conmittee is to further the industry's ability to oon$>ete by work­
ing to decrease unfair trade-related impediments to ccepetition in the
Major 1982 acoonvliahments of the committee and its five task
groins are grouped under task group headings:
Investment Policy: Reviewed and related to U.S. Trade Representa­
tive industry views on model bilateral investment treaty and two treaties
specific to Egypt and Panama.
Inter-Governmental: Supported coalition position on Vredeling pro­
posal which, in its current amended version, was a victory for U.S. multi­
nationals. Worked to moderate United Nations activities affecting chemical
trade and investment.
Import Policy: Began development of position on Generalized System
of Preferences, kept membership informed of tariff "harmonization" including
sponsorship of a seminar, followed Administration' a Caribbean Basin. Initia­
tive and Export Trading Company Act.
Export Policy: Supported Danforth "reciprocity” legislative effort
and developed positions on intellectual property rights and anti-boycott
regulations.
Export of Hazardous Substances: Effectively worked to move accept­
able report draft through Departoents of state and Cosmerce and the USTB
which led to draft of an Executive Order from the White House.
In addition to these task group-specific issues, the committee was
active in other areas.
Primary among these was petrochemical-related discussions between
the U.S. government and those of Europe, Japan and Mexico.
Representing the committee as well as their individual companies, mem­
bers assisted to the degree possible with six separate government agency
studies concerning petrochemical "competitiveness" and reviewed an American.
Enterprise Institute proposal for an overview study of U.S. trade policy.
To facilitate communication with member company trade contacts, a com­
pendium of committee positon end background papers was issued at our

REMARKS TO CMA BOARD
BY ROBERT E.
CHAIRMAN, INTERNATIONAL
JANUARY 10,
OF DIRECTORS
LORY
TRADE COMMITTEE
1983
This morning I'll be reporting to you on the work of CMA's International
Trade Committee in 1982, the second year of its formal existence. It's
obvious to all of us that in recent years chemical industry sales and
earnings have depended upon large volumes of exports. Three measurements
currently, however, are on an unfortunate downtrend.
In 1981 the dollar value of U.S. chemical exports was $21.2 billion,
in 1982 the value slipped to $20.4.billion.
For two consecutive years, the trade surplus in chemicals — the excess
of exports over imports — has decreased. The 1980, 1981 and 1982 dollar
values were, respectively, $12.2 billion, $11.9 billion and $10.9 billion.
Over the same two-year span, the share of industry sales going to the
export trade has declined from 12.8 percent to 11.8 percent.
The two sides of our current trade reality are clear: chemical exports
are decreasing while at the same time imports are on the rise.
There's another trade reality that the U.S. chemical industry has to
reckon with as well, and that is the swing toward protectionism we are
seeing all around the globe -~ including the U.S. This industry is
confident of its ability to compete in world trade — to the extent that
we are not blocked from doing so by governmental barriers, whether the
government be our own or that of a foreign country. While the words
of the International Trade Cosnittee's charter may say it more color­
fully, a short-text version of our mission is to work to remove existing
barriers and to derail attempts to create new ones.
With this mission as our focus, this morning I'll be covering what I
see as the Committee's major accomplishments during the year and the
major issues before us in 1983.
First a word on organization.
In 1982 two task groups were refocused and a new task group created —
bringing our task group number to five, we broadened the mission of the
North American Trade Policy Task Croup to include all import matters
affecting CMA member companies. The task group's name was changed to
Import Policy Task Croup-. We expanded the membership of our Multinational
Corporations Task Group and changed its name to the Intergovernmental
Organizations Task Group to better reflect its proper focus. Early in
CMA 037993
the year we formed an Investment Policy task Group to more adequately
cover this policy area and to provide support to Dexter Baker who is now
Chairman of the Investment Policy Advisory committee set up by the Trade
Representative's office.
Since I plan to cover 1982 accomplishments by task group area of concern,
the Investment Group is a good place to start. Shortly after its formation,
the group focused on the subject of bilateral investment treaties.
Through its work, we were able to give the Association's view on a model
treaty to United States Trade Representative (USTR) Ambassador Brock.
Investment treaties specific to Egypt and Panama were also discussed
with USTR.
This group also prepared and distributed to member companies a survey on
foreign investment to provide the committee with member input on specific
problem areas that should be addressed. Fifty-three companies responded,
and the data provided is now being analyzed by the task group.
I
Turning to the Intergovernmental Task Group, a main concern of its members
last year was the so-called "Vredeling Proposal" in the European coonunity.
As Leo Johnstone reported to you in October, the then-current draft of
the proposal called for advance consultation with workers on a variety of
management decisions — including investments in other parts of the world.
The Association supported the joint National Foreign Trade Couneil/U.S.
Council position on the issue and the heavily amended version that was
approved by the European Parliament was clearly a defeat for its backers
and was viewed as resulting from effective lobbying by U.S. multinationals.
A major reason behind the formation of this task group was the variety
of activities concerning international companies going on in various
agencies of the United Nations. During 1982 these activities were priori­
tized from the U.S. chemical industry perspective, and a number of meetings
with U.N. officials took place — including one with U.S. Ambassador
Kirkpatrick.
While developing countries often seem to be the loudest voices in the U.N.,
they are also loud in their demands for special treatment by individual
industrialized countries -- notably the United States and particularly
with respect to our treatment of the products they wish us to import.
The General System of Preferences (GSP) is an important U.S. recognition
of this demand. The system offers duty-free entry of a wide variety of
commodity and finished goods. GSP became effective January 4, 1976 and
will expire on January 3, 1985. The USTR administers GSP and it and the
Congress are expected to be holding hearings this year on its renewal.
Preparatory to our active involvement with this issue, the Import Policy
Task Group prepared and distributed to selected CMA members a questionnaire
designed to gather data on member awareness of and concern about GSP.
Our position is now in the early development stage.
I
i

CMA 037994
The U.S. tariff schedule in general is getting CMA attention due to the
program to "harmonize" our schedule with the Customs Corporation Council
Nomenclature, which is used by most of the world’s other industrialized
nations. Late in 1982, the International Trade Commission released
Chapters 28 and 29 of the new code. These deal with commodity inorganic
and organic chemicals, respectively. Chapters 30-39, dealing with enduse chemical products, are expected to be released in February. The
entire project is scheduled to be concluded by July 1, 1983, with imple­
mentation of the new harmonized code set for mid-1985. While unable to
take positions on individual products, CMA recognizes its potential
importance to members as some products will see significant tariff increases
or decreases. Because of this, we sponsored — with SOCMA and SPI — a
trade seminar on the subject that was attended by 45 industry representatives.
We will continue to supply timely information and procedural guidance to
member companies.
On a matter specific to this hemisphere, the Import Policy Task Group
reviewed the Administration's "Caribbean Basin Initiative" which was a
three-pronged program of trade, tax incentives and supplemental aid to
the Caribbean Basin countries to assist their economic progress. CMA
did not take a position on this subject, in that the bill currently
drafted does not offer significant chemical investment potential either
as an opportunity or threat for U.S. producers. However, we continue to
monitor the bill's progress.
Another piece of legislation on which we took no specific position was
the Export Trading Company Act, which is now law. This legislation may,
however, be helpful to smaller companies, and through the CMA News, we
informed members who might be interested in the subject about Commerce
Department and U.S. Chamber seminars dealing with it.
During 1982, a host of protectionist cries were raised in Washington,
many of which prominently featured a new buzzword, "reciprocity". Our
Export Policy Task Group was active in an industry coalition supporting
Senator Danforth's bill (S. 2094) which provides for extending Section 301
of the trade law to cover services, intellectual property rights, and
foreign direct investment. In July, CMA endorsement of the Danforth bill
— without amendments — was sent to the Senate Finance Committee. No
real action took place on this bill in 1982, but I'll consent further on
its outlook when I cover 1983 issues.
A position specific to the protection of intellectual property rights was
developed and forwarded to Commerce Secretary Baldrige. The Export Task
Group also prepared a position dealing with anti-boycott regulations;
this, however, has not been issued externally as yet, as we are awaiting
action by the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber, who have the leads
on this issue.
CMA 037995
Our fifth task group has bean dealing with one specific policy issue —
that of the export of so-called "hazardous substances". The rescinding of
President Carter's overly restrictive Executive Order was a direct result
of chemical industry efforts, and a number of CMA suggestions have been
incorporated in the present acceptable form of the proposed new order now
in the White House. Our objective all along has been to keep this as a
simple notification scheme — without any form of government control and
not tied to specific shipments. So far, we've succeeded. To put the
industry stake here in perspective, the wrong outcome on this one would
immediately put into jeopardy some half billion dollars worth of pesticides
exports.
In addition to issues worked mostly within our task groups, the Committee
has been active in a number of other areas.
A primary area of activity has centered on petrochemical discussions
between the U.s. and other governments. While discussions with the Connon
Market were dormant during 1982, CMA provided two groups of advisors to
assist the O.S. Trade Representative and the Department of commerce,
respectively, in preparing for and carrying out talks with Japan and Mexico,
u.s. efforts in the Japanese talks were directed toward giving them a
better understanding of what they considered to be our unnatural advantage
in natural gas pricing. Mexican focus, while not yet clarified, is
expected to be on the export of their products into the U.S. Leo Johnstone
has led the CMA-fielded groups of industry advisors with excellent results
to date. With respect to the Mexican talks, the Committee formulated a
set of proposed U.S. objectives and passed these to Commerce.
One thing these discussion activities highlight is that U.S. industry,
with all its problems, is far from being alone in searching for solutions.
Last month, delegations from CMA and CEFIC met — at the Europeans'
request — to discuss common views with respect to a number of inter­
national trade matters.
A familiar response to a perceived problem is to initiate a study. During
1982, six separate studies regarding various aspects of petrochemical
"competitiveness" were progressed by various U.S. agencies. These include
the Commerce Department, the International Trade Commission (two studies),
the USTR, the World Bank/IMF, and the Office of Technology Assessment.
The committee and member companies assisted to the degree possible with
each. In connection with one of the International Trade Commission studies
— on investment performance requirements — the Committee prepared a
"statement for the record" on the short-comings of the questionnaire
designed to provide its data base. The "use" of these various studies
bureaucratic study often is not a precursor to but, more times than not,
a substitute for meaningful action.
CMA 037996
If these government-initiated studies were not enough, last year the
Committee reported to you that we were working to develop a study of the
chemical industry's international trade problems. This was dropped as a
chemical industry project, but an ad hoc group of industry members have
interested the American Enterprise Institute in conducting a wider study
of U.S. trade policy. CMA has reviewed and taken no exception to the
initial effort to scope the study. The Association will not be participating
as a financial supporterWith governmental and media interest in trade at seemingly an all-time
high, the Committee felt it worthwhile to develop for its own use a set
of general communication guidelines which put current and future trade
policy matters in perspective.
On a related topic, the development of positions is effective only insofar
as they are communicated. In addition to the specific targeting of position
papers I've mentioned earlier, late last year the Committee put together
a compendium of its positions and background papers. This was distributed
at our October Open Meeting and subsequently mailed to each member company
trade contact. Additionally, throughout the year, trade contacts were
provided with information on a wide variety of trade related topics.
What's ahead for us this year?
The short answer is more of the same.
Government-to-government petrochemical discussions still will be with us,
Mexico is currently anticipated to be the most important in 1983, but Japan
talks could be re-instituted at any time. Canada also at any time could
initiate a request for discussions. While in recent months European
talks have been dormant, these too could awaken.
with respect to the Export of Hazardous Substances issue — should the
Presidential Executive Order be, as we expect, acceptable to industry, this
subject will still demand close CMA scrutiny in its subsequent legislative
and regulatory phases.
We also will be closely monitoring developments as OSTR and Congress
formulate their policies regarding renewal of the Generalised System of
Preferences.
We can expect protectionist voices to continue calling for reciprocity
legislation. With other groups, CMA will continue to push for S. 2094
without amendments. This isn't going to be easy, and I can't say the
outlook is very favorable.
We will continue to work closely with USTR and others as appropriate on
Bilateral Investment Treaties and other investment related issues.

CMA 037997
The U.N. moves slowly, but given its role as a forum for developing
countries and given these countries' attitudes about multinationals and
their role in the "New Economic Order”, and a host of views that boil
down to an "It is more blessed to receive than give" posture, selective
monitoring of U.N. activities is clearly warranted.
And, we'll no doubt have some surprises from legislators and regulators
— both here and abroad — as they seek to further their individual causes
at chemical industry cost.
For its work in 1983, the Committee has the resources it needs. It, has
an active and knowledgeable membership. Its task groups have excellent
participation and management. Committee and task groups benefit from
excellent CMA staff support — and from the active and effective partici­
pation of industry leaders such as Leo Johnstone and Dexter Baker who,
with Conmittee members and CMA staff, have maintained close ties with key
government people. He have excellent rapport and high credibility in this
general area of trade where industry objectives are similar to those of
the Administration.
In closing, I would, however, ask each of you to consider the active
participation of your trade experts in our Committee task groups. If you
perhaps have no one in your organization who you would judge to be such
an expert, I submit that you seriously consider developing that expertise.
I further submit that membership on one of our task groups is a costeffective way to obtain it. I firmly believe you need this expertise.
In past years, "trade" as such may not have been all that glamorous a
subject. But if one measures glamor by the amount of news media attention
a subject gets, that past truth is truth no longer. Glamor aside, I'm
hopeful that my presentation this morning has helped underscore the
subject's importance to this industry today — and, more important,
tomorrow.
CMA
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In 1982 the major tax problems faced by the chemical industry were
presented in the context of legislation to reduce growing federal budget
deficits in significant part by increasing taxes on business. Tax measures
which are considered in this political context are judged primarily on
their ability to raise Federal revenues, rather than on merit or reason.
During this past year CMA and its member companies were successful
largely by limiting legislative'tax losses, rather than by obtaining new
tax benefits. Although these achievements were made in the context of
legislation which substantially reduced the income tax benefits of investing
in chemical plant and equipment, they were nonetheless important. These
achievements include:
o
o
o
o
Rejection of proposed alternative minimum tax
Maintenance of foreign tax credit and deferral of tax
on current foreign income of foreign subsidiaries
Maintenance of Domestic International Sales Corporations
(DISC) provisions with current benefits reduced by 15 percent
Maintenance of Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) with
reduction of 5 percent of ACRS benefits when full 10 percent
investment tax credit is taken on ACRS property
With Federal budget deficits for Fiscal 1983 and Fiscal 1984 now projected
to exceed $175 and $200 billion respectively, we anticipate that the Adminis­
tration and the Congress will again seek in the 98th Congress to reduce th s
deficits through tax increase legislation. The problems encountered in 1982
by CMA and the chemical industry are likely to be repeated in 1983.
In this environment, the Tax Policy Contittee will direct its efforts in
1983 to the following major tax goals and objectives:
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
o
Monitor tax and funding aspects of public compensation
legislation and consult with other CMA committees on
appropriate action.
Maintain tax incentives for U.S. exports which are at least
equivalent to DISC
Maintain present treatment of foreign tax credit and deferral
of current income of foreign subsidiaries
Maintain and improve Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS)
and Investanent Tax Credit
Resist any increase or expansion of minimum tax on corporations
Improve and extend tax credit for research and development
Extend statutory moratorium on Treasury Regulations § 1.861-8
which require allocation of research and development expenses
to foreign income
Provide chemical industry connnents on Treasury Regulations
(when issued) interpreting CERCLA taxes on chemicals and
petroleum
Provide chemical industry cosnents on Treasury Regulations
(when issued) on 1981 ERTA and 1982 TEFRA legislation.

REMARKS TO CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
ay GLENN W, WHITS
CHAIRMAN. TAX POLICY COMMITTEE
JANUARY 10, 1383
1982 was not a good year for the chemical industry in terms of U.S. tax
policy. Changes in U.S. tax law adopted as the Tax Equity and Fiscal
Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) now place the chemical industry in a
position worse than when this Administration took office. It is important
to note that the TEFRA changes were not as adverse proportionately for
other industries, such as basic metal production or oil refining.
How bad were the 1982 changes? In 1980 the "Superfund" legislation was
adopted. Many observers in the chemical industry viewed that event as
one of the worst that has ever befallen this industry. Superfund calls
for the collection of about $1.4 billion over a 5-year period. This is
an after-tax amount of about $150 million per year, of which the chemical
industry is paying 80 percent or $120 million per year.
(In fact, actual
collections are somewhat less because of low industry operating levels.)
The 2 percent reduction in investment tax credit costs the chemical industry
over $250 million annually, more than twice as much as Superfund. Remember,,
the reduction in investment tax credit was only one part of the adverse
changes in TEFRA.
Ironically, much of the' adverse impact from TEFRA may not be felt by the
industry in 1983 because of the poor overall condition of the U.S. economy.
On the positive side, several adverse proposals did not become law. The
proposed alternative minimum tax was not adopted. There was 'no legislation
making significant adverse changes in the U.S. taxation of foreign source
income. The acceleration of depreciation from 7.5 to 5 years that had
become law in 1981 was preserved, although the future improvement in the
rate of depreciation that was to have become effective in 1985 and 1986 was
lost with an impact in those years of more than $1.5 billion in cash for the
industry.
Having set the stage with these comments on the state of tax affairs, let
me assure you that the Tax Policy Committee is alive and well and doingits best in light of the help we get from our friends in government.
The committee's membership presently stands at 21. Committee meetings are
generally attended by more*individuals than that number. All of the members
are active, and each one brings a valuable perspective and insight to the
conmittae.
CMA 038000
We have three operating task groups: Capital Formation, Foreign Taxation,
and Value Added Taxation. We are in the process of establishing a new task
group in the area of State and Local Taxation. This latter area has become
of more concern with the concept of "New Federalism" and the concommitant
need for more funds by the states.
In the task groups, we make an effort to include persons other them
committee members. This gives an opportunity for a larger group to participate
in industry tax affairs.
It also provides the committee with an opportunity
to obtain the special talents of experts and an opportunity to see prospective
future committee members in action.
The role of the Tax Policy Committee is to keep you advised of all relevant
developments in the tax area. To do this we carefully watch proposed legis­
lation, the promulgation of new regulations, prospective treaties and new
litigation. Where any of these facets of developing tax law alert us to
changes that affect the industry, we will advise you on the implications of
such developments. Where appropriate, we will suggest policies the industry
may wish to follow.
In developing new industry positions, we work towards a consensus view. After
all, a position cannot be that of the industry unless substantially all of'
the members find it at least acceptable. That means the debate is occasion­
ally crisp. Nonetheless, we generally can reach quick accord because we
recognize the other side is the government and it wants our money.
Tax legislative policy probably presents a different problem than any other
issue the industry faces. Tax legislation is an ever-present issue that is
not resolved by a legislative enactment. Instead, the federal tax law is
under ongoing review by the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means
Committee and the various staff organizations, as well as the individual
members' staffs. There has been some sort of serious tax legislative thrust
posed in each Congressional session since 1968. Significant laws were enacted
in 1969, 1971, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1982. Because of the
ongoing nature of these enactments, and because of the peculiarly complicated
and highly technical nature of this legislation, it is necessary to provide
continuous review and contact, particularly with the staff persons in Congress
and Treasury who are responsible for developing new legislation.
Member companies carry out this activity on an individual basis both through
their technical tax staffs and government relations offices. The continuity
in the Tax Policy Connittee as presently constituted better enables us to
follow and adopt sound positions in the ever-changing matrix of technical
proposals.
CMA 038001
CMA's staff representative for the Tax Policy Committee came to us from the
House Ways and Means Committee and, as a consequence, can and does assist
the committee in being aware of what is happening in the staff arena.

The committee continues to use the law firm of Miller and Chevalier as outside
counsel- Messers. Sherfy and Heyde from that firm provide valuable assistance
in drafting position papers for the committee after the positions are establish­
ed. They and other members of the firm provide valuable insights on a variety
of tax issues as new situations develop.
During 1983 we foresee development of a number of serious tax issues. With a
budget deficit in excess of $150 billion, it is almost certain an effort will
be made to raise taxes, including the corporate income tax. Several areas are
likely to be affected. Probably there will be a second bite at the investment
tax credit apple. If recapture of the whole credit is taken out of basis, the
credit would be reduced to about 6 percent, with an additional cost to the
chemical industry of $280 million. There is a sentiment to tax employee
benefits such as medical and other insurance premiums, and perhaps some forms
of deferred compensation not presently taxed. There seems to be a renewed
interest in taxing the overseas operations of U.S. corporations.

A new tax thrust is posed by the so-called public compensation legislation.'
The tax watch on this legislation is critical. In my view, this could be a
legislative catastrophe for the industry.

It is likely there will be changes during 1983 in the way U.S. exports will
be taxed. It is clear that the members of the GATT Council are convinced that
the existing Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC) is in breach of
the subsidies code. Our Deputy Trade Representative has agreed the Adminis­
tration will prepare legislation in this area.. Although Treasury has rec­
ommended that the DISC be repealed, and that no tax substitute be established
in its place, there is good sentiment for a continuation of tax support for
U.S. exports. The Tax Policy Committee will press strongly for a tax system
that provides export assistance at least equivalent to the DISC. — Here I
pause for my only coranercial. We of Dow hope you'll support an effort to
revise the system so the presently accrued DISC earnings will not be taxed in
the future. Believe me, it is more important to most of you than it is to me.
End of commercial. —
We await regulations interpreting the tax law in several important areas.
Mo regulations have been issued for the windfall profits tax, or for
superfund. Regulations are due any day now on the foreign tax credit; of
course, I've been told that consistently for more than nine months. I guess
you'd call that an inhuman gestation period. Almost no regulations have
been issued in connection with the 1981 ERTA and 1982 TEFRA legislation.
CMA 038002
We stand prepared to comment on all of these regulations as they come forth
in proposed form.
This past year we undertook a new activity for the committee. We filed an
amici brief in support of a member company's attempt to get to the U.S.
Supreme Court. This issue involves the availability to the Internal Revenue
Service of the corporate analysis of its tax reserve account. That account
establishes the potential liability of the taxpayer on issues in the tax
return about which there is some question. CMA is supporting the taxpayer's
effort to get a review of this matter by the Supreme Court.
We propose to continue to provide support to you in all of these tax areas.
We are willing to undertake any other efforts you, the Board, the Executive
Committee or members request.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
EXHIBIT F
CMA's communications program reflects ths shift in
direction to an issue-oriented, balanced industry communi­
cations program.
This advocacy campaign draws on the com­
bined resources and perspectives of the Association's
Government ‘Relations, Technical and Communications
departments, providing a stronger force with which the
Association can communicate with legislators, other
associations and industries, and the general public.
CMA's
focused, cost-effective communications program is aimed at
developing an equitable environment in which to develop public
policy.
The Communications Committee, its task groups and the
CMA staff are the backbone of this communications program.
Together, these groups create elements that include news
relations and general public relations activities.
Mews media activities are designed to voice industry
and Association policy and programs to the press.
These
reflect the department's close relationship with Government
Relations and the Association's shift to targeted efforts.
This program element grows in importance as our relationship
with the press consistently needs nurturing both from a
national and local community level.
The media tour program
reached more than 99.cities by the first of January including
178 television, 152 radio and 209 newspaper interviews with
CMA staff and Science Advisory Group members.
Clearly, this
kind of activity enhances CMA and industry relationships with
the press and gives us one more positive step toward achieving
balanced reporting.
Another approach to broadening press relationships is the
placement of CMA officers and executives on major speaking
platforms, such as the Detroit Economic Club, the World Affairs
Council of Pittsburgh and the Executive Club of Chicago.
The
first of these featured CMA Chairman Simeral speaking on the
Policy Agenda for the Chemical Industry in 1983, focusing on
the economy, international trade and environmental regulation.
Twenty reporters from national and trade publications partici­
pated.
This kind of activity creates a positive profile for
the industry.
The news media section will be instrumental in helping
to develop major communications efforts over the course of the
year focusing on specific critical issues such as hazardous
waste disposal and. public compensation.
These efforts will
include many aspects of the ongoing CMA communications program,
i.e. special press kits to be used at the local level, radio
broadcast and telSvision programming, issues advertising and
speaker engagements.
An example of this kind of specialized
issue effort is the "clean water" program currently in effect
and targeted for four congressional districts.
This effort
includes media tours, which began in December in areas of
West Virginia, New York State and Kentucky.
These will be
followed by radio broadcasts and issues advertising when the
Clean Water Act reau.thorization is introduced in Congress-.
This communications strategy is successful in reaching the
CMA 038004
Representatives of these districts, it will be used with
other issues alsawhara.
CHA broadcast network continuas to axpand.
It includes
THE REPORT, a series of three-minute newsfeatures distributed
biweekly to a 1,500 station network, spontaneous newsfeeds
with actuality sent to anywhere from 1,250 to 1,650 stations,
90-second television newsfeatures and expanded activity at
the American Women in Radio and Television (AWRT) and the
National Farm Broadcasters Association (NAFB) conventions.
A prime example of the 'good' that comes from such efforts is
the press and broadcast activity surrounding the Livingston, Loui.
siana, train'derailment in September.
CHEMTREC, CMA's
Chemical Transportation Emergency Center, was notified of the
incident within minutes of the derailment.
The director of
CHEMTRE-C participated in 14 telephone interviews.
These
efforts were supported by the CHEMTREC newsfmature which was
flown to seven local stations and the cable news network,
reaching an audience of more than 36 million people, producing
balanced reporting while diffusing negative reactions toward
the chemical industry.
Although the national print advertising has been termi­
nated, some localized issues advertising on specific topics
-is being prepared for use in targeted areas.
Currently, a
clean water ad to be signed by a national coalition is being
developed to support the clean water efforts in congressional
districts in West Virginia and New York State.
The CMA
Advertising Task Group has allotted $30,000 to the Special
Clean Water Work Group for this effort.
Other issues
advertising is being developed on an as needed basis in
support of other program activities.
In the last 27 years, CMA's Catalyst Awards Program has
honored 134 college, junior college and high school teachers
with national awards.
Some of these winners have displayed
outstanding speaking talents and will be considered for pos­
sible speaking engagements to further CMA's contact with
various educational and consumer groups.
This is an inexpen­
sive way of tapping a greatly underused resource.
Production of four public service announcements (PSAs)
are targeted for completion in the spring.
These PSAs will
be in keeping with the new issue-focus and will be distribu­
ted to 200 major market stations.
Osage will be tracked to
evaluate the success
and cost-effectiveness of this activity.
The three PSAs extracted from "The Need to Know,”
CMA's
16 ma. film on hazardous waste disposal, have been aired
1,500 times with an approximate viewing audience of 36 million.
Distribution of "The Need to Know” and "Doing Something"
continues with community group showings of more than 1,750 to
an estimated viewing audience of nearly 48,000.
Television airings for the two films are more than 500 with an estimated
audience of 1.15 million.
CMA 038005
-3CMA's consumer information program continual to identify "multiplier" organizations who will transmit Association
massagas to millions of viewers and raadars at minimal cost.
Existing print and audio visual material is being marketed
to such groups.
Programs with AWRT are being reevaluated
for their cost-efficiency.
Activities with NAFB last year
included 80 five-minute television and 208 radio interviews
made by 45 broadcasters.
The estimated listening audience
was 10 million and total air time was 31 hours.
A new
project is planned for the in-house production and national
satellite delivery of 10 consumer information pieces for TV
news and talk shows.
This will be coordinated with other
CMA broadcast activities.
With greater attention to cost, CMA is evaluating the
mailing lists of its two newsletters, ChemEcology and CMA
News.
Both are being evaluated for possible reduction in
number of pages and a reader survey of each is also being
considered.
CheaEcology Special Reports continue to be
included in special news media packages for the press.
CMA is supporting a pilot regional communications pro­
gram in Louisiana with the Louisiana Chemical Association
This program reflects the Association's focus on
state and local issues.
The national purpose of this pilot
program is to develop a model plan that other states and areas
can use as well as to create a more positive public identity
for the chemical industry in Louisiana.
Limited to one
state, the program is molded to that state's communications
needs and will be carried out by the state chemical industry
council or its equivalent along with the support of companies
that make up the council.
CMA is providing $100,000 for the
pilot and will offer guidance to LCA and its public relati ns
director.
The program is being put into place this month
and will be evaluated after one year.
The CMA communications program was funded until now by
a separate "ChemCAP" assessment which stood at 40 percent
of member company dues.
With the dollars saved by the eli­
mination of the national print advertising program added to
existing carry-over funds, CMA was able to reduce the 82/83
assessment to 20 percent.
Beginning in fiscal year 83/84,
the special assessment will be wrapped into overall dues.
The assessment'.wrap-in reflects the industry's commitment
to an industry communications program that is well-balanced,
cost-effective and a necessary support to all Association
activities.

REMARKS TO CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
By William M. Metten Jr.
Chairman, Communications Committee
January 10, 1983
The Communications Committee appreciates this opportunity
to bring you up-to-date on our industry's communications pro­
grams, priorities and problems.
In the next few minutes I
would like to outline a new direction in the focus of our
communications program, share with you several examples of how
CMA communications activities support our industry's goals, and,
lastly, touch on the future communications challenges facing our
industry.
But first, a brief overview of how the public perceives the
chemical industry may be of interest.
The negative perception
that the public has of our industry has not changed.
The public
believes that the industry is irresponsible in its management of
wastes and is unwilling to deal with critical environmental
issues unless forced by federal and state legislation.
The public's perception of us as bad guys is influenced and
reinforced by a news media which is steadily chipping away at
the private enterprise fabric of our society...by docu-dramas
that protray business and businessmen as dishonest and motivated
by money alone...by the outcries of environmentalists and selfstyled protectors of the public interest.
It's no wonder, is it, that opinion survey after opinion
survey shows such a negative public attitude toward our industry
with the hazardous waste issue the foremost issue preoccupying
the public's perception.
And like it or not, perception equals
reality in the public's mind.
Our cause is not aided either by the fact that the Admini­
stration, because of economic and other political considerations,
has not been able to provide the leadership necessary to influence
legislative activities to deal with the problems of our industry.
Within the past six months CMA's communications program has
undergone a significant change in direction.
Three factors are
primarily responsible for bringing about this change.
One will
certainly come as no surprise to anyone in this room -- the
economy has not been kind to our industry.
In this adverse
economic climate, the Communications Committee recognized the
need to reduce communications expenditure, a decision consistent
with actions taken by many member companies.
As you know, a
substantial reduction In CMA communications expenditures occurred
in the print advertising area.
As a result of eliminating the
national print advertising program, the 1982 ChemCAP assessment
has been reduced from 40 percent to 20 percent.
The second factor contributing to a change in the direction
of our communications program is a closer liaison with CMA's
Government R lations Committee.
CMA 038007
A strong relationship between Government Relations and
Communications is essential when you consider the necessity
for our industry's communications to be focused around and
in support of the legislative issues facing our industry.
A
stronger bridge has been built between the Communications and
Government Relations Committees for cross-fertilization of ideas
and planning communications strategies and building constituencies.
This is a relatively recent marriage.
At this point, both partners
are enthusiastic about the opportunities for coordinating CMA
communications more closely with government relations objectives.
We look forward to the day when this approach bears fruit.
The third element of the new direction in our industry's
communications activities is a desire to try new and different
approaches in our ongoing commitment to reshape the public's
negative perception of our industry.
We recognize that we are
locked into a constant and shifting battle for the public's under­
standing and support.
Results are difficult to come by.
Victories
are few.
But we must vote present on the issues and use every
means at our disposal to communicate the industry's accomplishments
and commitment on industry issues.
We have initiated two activities
which illustrate the use of innovative communications approaches
to accomplish these objectives.
One involves a pilot regional
communications program in cooperation with the Louisiana Chemical
Association.
This program will be tailored to that state's communications
priorities, and the leadership is being provided by Louisiana
Chemical Association and its member companies.
Funds are being madti
available from our communications budget for one year.
The Louisi­
ana experiment begins this month.
We hope that the experience
gained will be useful in developing model communications programs
for use in other states to develop public policy support at the
grass roots level.
1
Another innovative approach involves a grass roots communica­
tions program in support of clean water.
This is the first time
that we have targeted a single message within key congressional
districts to build a coalition of supporters and activate a public
relations campaign at the grass roots level.
Here again, this is
a learning experience, and we are hopeful that it will produce
results which can be applied elsewhere.
Personally speaking,
I am excited about these new approaches
and the new direction that our communications program is taking.
I know that our Communications Committee shares this feeling.
The members of our committee -- your employees -- have contributed
greatly to shape and guide these new communications activities.
Now I would like to touch on the other communications activities which continue to play an important role in CMA's overall
communications program.
CMA 038008
I am referring to such activities as:
CMA's media tours which are planned around a specific
issue and targeted for maximum impact in geographical areas and
congressional districts.
Media tours consistently delivered
results, and we are increasing the tours in 1933.
Broadcast communications is another results-oriented
communications activity.
CMA now broadcasts a regular series
of three-minute radio features dedicated to major issues of the
association and distributed bi-weekly to 1900 stations.
e
The balanced television newsfeed continues to be a key
ingredient in our news activities.
For example, we fed a recent
feature on Superfund via satellite to more than 400 stations.
e
Consumer information programming -- this activity con­
tinues to generate results and good will for our industry and
maintains mutually beneficial relations between CMA and consum r,
public interest, educational and other influential groups.
Th
objective here is also to advocate our position on major issues
as well as provide a forum for member companies to talk about their
individual product benefits.
At conventions like the American Women in Radio and Televi­
sion, industry experts are interviewed on a variety of subjects.
In the aftermath of the train derailment at Livingston, Louisiana,
CMA's Chemtrec staff and news service department turned some
adverse circumstances into a positive media experience.
In the time remaining I would like to take a prospective look
at the major issues confronting our industry and suggest some ways
that our Communications Committee is considering addressing the
issues in support of our industry's position.
The biggest single issue which adversely affects the public's
perception
of our industry is hazardous waste disposal.
Notwith­
standing efforts by our member companies and an ongoing program
by CMA itself, the public perceives that they are at great risk
from chemical wastes.
The hazardous waste issue has such a grip
on the national consciousness that this single issue affects the
public's perception on other industry issues such as clean air and
clean water.
Later on today, I will have the opportunity to ad­
dress the public perception of hazardous waste issues as part of
a Waste Management Plan presentation to be considered by the
Executive Committee.
in closing, I would like to acknowledge the contribution of
individuals on our committee and thank you for contributing their
advice and counsel on the tough communications problems our
incustry is facing.
Their efforts continue to make a real contri­
bution to our program.
I also wish to acknowledge the efforts of
CMA's communications staff whose enthusiasm and commitment on
behalf of our industry is a key element in the progress we have
made in recent months.

THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS GROUP
REPORT TO THE CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
January 11, 1963
Presented by Dr. E. H. Blair
Tha Dow Chemical Company
The International Affairs Group (LAG) was formed by approval of the CMA
Board and of the SOOlA Board, in November 1979.
A record of the activities of IAG can be found in the minutes of the
Steering Committee meetings, and a copy of the Charter exists in the CMA
office, copies are available to those who wish to have one.
IAG is concerned with the international consequences of efforts by
national governments, groups of governments and/or international organi­
zations to manage the identification and control of chemical risks to
human health and the environment.
The U.S. chemical industry trade associations and their member companies
have actively supported a constructive domestic policy on the identifi­
cation and control of chemical risks to health and the environment. Such
matters may cross national borders, as does the flow of chemical
substances and chemical industry investment. There is growing inter­
national initiative in the health, safety and environmental arena. Thus,
it is necessary that the U.S. chemical industry via IAG develop and
support a constructive international policy to meet the need for
increased international understanding of, and commitment to, these
objectives.
During the past three years, IAG has held numerous meetings with the
European Council of Chemical Manufacturers Federations (CEFIC), com­
prises many national chemical industry trade associations, including
those for countries within the European Community. This past year
members of IAG traveled to Japan to conduct discussions on matters of
testing and control of chemical substances with the Japanese Chemical
Industry Association (JCIA), and through JCIA, the Ministries of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), and Health and Welfare, and
Labor.
In addition to the multiplicity of laws affecting the trade of chemicals
between various nations is the ever-increasing activity of supranational
bodies. These include the European Economic community (EEC), the
Organization of Economic Cooperation- and Development (OECD) Chemicals
Programme, the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), and a host
of technical and scientific programs that fall under various United
Nations and other global governmental programs.
CMA 038011
Possibly the most important evidence of IAG's activity is in the OECD
arena. At the recent High Level Meeting II, the United States succeeded
in its two- year attempt to avoid imposition of testing requirements for
new chemicals, in the form of OECD's minimum pre-marketing data set
(MPD). These requirements would have been placed on new chemicals prior
to manufacture in the U.S. for domestic use.
Under an agreement worked out November 15-17, spearheaded by EPA
Administrator, Anne Gorsuch, OECD delegations endorsed a U.S. proposal
that would allow individual OECD nations to select their own approaches
for reviewing new chemicals. This success is due, to a large part, to
IAG's activities working closely with those of OECD's Business and
industry Advisory Committee (BIAC), while in fact providing much of the
muscle and advocacy behind BXAC's positions to ensure that U.S.
industries were not shorted in the international arena. In effect, our
success at these recent OECD meetings means that the U.S. industry's
requirements for pre-manufacture notifications on new chemical sub­
stances will remain unchanged for the present. TSCA will not have to be
amended
in this respect because of international pressures and
commitments. Other agreements which the U.S. delegation obtained were:
Good laboratory practices to provide a reliable basis for
mutual acceptance of testing data.
Protection for confidential business information.
Agreement to consolidate and evaluate,
continue to expand OECD work on chemicals.
"Data interpretation Guides" for initial hazard assess­
ment of chemicals.
rather
than
we are now at the beginning of a 5-10 year experience in which the
Japanese requirements will co-exist with TSCA Section 5 law, with the
European Community base-set systems in its ten member states, and with
the OECD MPD system, as it is or will be implemented in other OECD
countries, such as Australia and possibly Canada.
I AG will have a major role in participating in this comparative
experience in the interest of international trade and against the
increasing demands for protectionism. If any changes in TSCA Section 5
are seen to have merit, on review of the next 5-10 years global
experience with new chemicals, IAG should have a critical role in that
evaluation.
Similarly, assessing the risk of existing chemicals will require
monitoring of the various national programs to minimize duplication, to
assure
that trade disincentives are not created,
and to speed
understanding of new information, testing procedures, etc. How much of
this IAG should or can do remains to be determined.
CMA 038012
international compliance programs where IAG can provide guidance
are those of labeling, waste disposal, occupational health, and possibly
transportation. Again, the extent and depth of LAG'S involvement in
these activities, in terms of participation with other domestic and
international chemical industry groups, needs to be determined.
Other
lAG's activity in the "confidentiality of identity" issue in the
European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemicals (EINECS) taught us
the importance of increasing direct contacts as early as possible with
the individual national chemical industry trade associations, while at
the same time coordinating with the regional groups, especially CEFIC.
This lesson can be used in the continuing aspects of this issue, now
directed at the PMN systems, and probably also in the several different
labeling systems which need to be made compatible and ultimately
harmonized. These conflicting systems are now developing in different
countries. Differences are evident in the methods by which chemicals are
classified by their delayed- effect hazards, such as cancer. The same is
true for the language used on labels to warn about these hazards. For
example, there is the potential of warning about a cancer hazard in
Europe, but not in the United States. The implications of this
difference for product liability are substantive. IAG has formed a Work
Group to develop a route to an international consensus on this question.
This group will coordinate with the AIHC and CMA's OSH Committee, as
well as counterpart organizations in the industry.
During the coming months and years, IAG must continue to formulate and
implement programs to deal with international chemical controls. We will
need to identify and analyze national and international health and
environmental issues of concern to the U.S. chemical industry. As rising
expectations and concerns develop worldwide on chemical contaminations,
w will need to develop positions responsive to these concerns, develop
strategy and action plans and use and coordinate appropriate industry
resources.
in managing these issues we must do more to establish and maintain
national and international relations necessary for effective dissemina­
tion and exchange of information. To do so means working with other
trade associations in the U.S. and in foreign lands, working with the
appropriate agencies and representatives of the U.S. .and foreign
governments, wherever appropriate, and with international organizations
such as UNEP, OECD, etc.
in our activities we continue to examine new channels for the flow of
information in order to identify issues and to develop positions on
these issues. As in the past, we will develop numerous position papers
where needed, reports and documents, and bring them to the attention of
foreign chemical industry trade associations, and, where necessary, to
continue our direct trade association personal contacts.
CMA 038013
-4In conclusion, there is much for IAG to do in the next 5-10 years. The
critical question remains, how to balance IAG resources and capabilities
with the needs as they develop. I and my associates will continue to
keep you informed on these matters and to seek help and guidance when
needed.
If you have any questions,

I would be pleased to accept them at this

PROPOSED PROGRAM ON ALKANOLAMINES
Problem/Backqround*
In 1978 a feeding study conducted in Japan
indicated that triethanolamine is a suspect
carcinogen.
Review of this study by
industry scientists identified several areas
in which the study may be flawed, including
the possible formation of nitrosamines in
the test diet.
Nevertheless, cosmetics and
surfactant manufacturers have expressed a
concern over the Japanese data.
In
addition, triethanolamine has been nominated
to the National Toxicology Program for
testing in the areas of pharmacokinetics,
mutagenicity, reproduction and
carcinogenicity.
The four manufacturers of triethanolamin
reached agreement on a research program and
asked CMA to set up a Program on this
chemical.
Accordingly, the Special Programs
Division convened an exploratory meeting
where the group wrote a program charter and
tentative budget.
The Program was reviewed
and received favorable responses by the
Special Programs Advisory Committee (SPAC>
and CMA staff.
The Panel will conduct 14 and 90-day skin
painting studies on triethanolamine and
provide these •data’- to NTP.
In addition,
dermal metabolism studies may be conduct d.
Depending upon the results of the Panelsponsored studies and the proposed NTP
studies, the Panel may proceed to a dermal
carcinogenicity study.
Recommendations
The Executive Committee accept SPAC's
recommendation for approval for this
program.

RESPONSE TO INQUIRY
What i3 the chemical industry's position on Public Compensation?
Our industry is committed to protecting the public from the
health and safety risks of chemicals and waste disposal sites.
Several government and private organizations have studied the
impact of chemicals and waste disposal sites on public health
but none has established on a scientific basis that there is a
broad health problem.
Therefore, the chemical industry strongly
supports and encourages continued data collection and analysis to
determine the extent of any possible health effects in this area.
Such data collection is already mandated by existing statute.
Until the nature and scope of this issue is better understood it
would be unwise to create a broad new public health compensation
system.
In the meantime, current compensation systems such as
Social Security, Worker's Compensation, the courts and private
insurance, should be adequate to protect individuals who may have
a legitimate basis for seeking relief.
The chemical industry is
prepared to cooperate in the collection, analysis and interpretation
of information needed to establish a sound understanding of the
health risks associated with waste sites.
J
1
Would your industry support the Asbestos Coalition Proposal?
The chemical industry will not support the chemical supplement
to the Asbestos Proposal.
Since data does not exist that indicates
any major health effects from chemicals it would be totally erroneous
to group chemicals, with their very different characteristics and
effects, together with asbestos.

MEMBER SERVICES DEPARTMENT
STATUS REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
JANUARY 11,
1983
Member Services is two years old this month.
Since
the report of a year ago,
state chemical groups' activ­
ities
have accelerated.
At that time, there were eighteen
organizations with which we worked. Today there are 24 in
19 states.
The Iberville Chemical Industry Council was formed in
Louisiana. It, like the councils in River Parishes and Lake
Charles, serves in an autonomous satellite capacity to the
Louisiana Chemical Association.
A chemical industry committee, under the wing of the
Associated Industries of Kentucky, was organized in
November.
We now have relationships with two local councils in
Ohio — Cincinnati and Cleveland.
The Ohio Chemical Council
is working with them as independent satellites and hopes to
aid in the formation of other similar local groups.
An effort was made by companies to establish a group in
South Carolina. While well supported by a large majority of
concerned firms, the matter is now on hold. There was definite
opposition from a few companies who felt interests were being
served by the State Chamber of Commerce and the South Carolina
Textile Manufacturers Association. Marketing considerations
also were involved in the decision.
We are in a hand-holding stage with an ill-defined,
fledgling group in Wisconsin, which did send a representative
to the Second Annual Meeting of State Organizations in Chicago
last October.
States with viable organizations, excluding South Carolina
and Wisconsin, include:
Alabama, California, Connecticut,
Delaware, Louisiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri,
New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas,
Virginia and West Virginia.
Nearly every group either has greatly expanded its scope
of operations or is well along in planned expansions. Notable
examples are California, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio. All
groups, however, are concerned with the need to increase
CMA 038021
membership and institute a dues structure which will make
possible carrying out projects in support of their programs.
They are making ever greater use of CMA-generated mater­
ials and are calling on me and others in the CMA departments
for assistance. Similarly, they are now drawing progressively
more on each other -- exchanging information and copying
successful projects without any feeling of damaged proprietary
interests.
There has grown a sense of unity between state groups and
with CMA. The relationships are good, and they no longer feel
challenged or harbor the fear that CMA is attempting to take
them over.
The latter point, however, always must be borne
in mind.
There have been a few instances when CMA committee
members or staff have been perceived as dictating to a group.
These have been due to misunderstandings, at times on both
sides, and rather quickly corrected.
During the past year, 1 have met, on invitation, with the
boards of the Ohio and California Councils; committees of those
in Ohio and Louisiana; attended and spoke at the annual meetings of
councils in Louisiana, New Jersey, Texas and Ohio.
I also
worked on site in organizational or restructuring meetings in
California, South Carolina and Kentucky.
CMA has assisted or will assist in membership drives in
New Jersey, California, Kentucky, Ohio, Alabama, Illinois and
Missouri.
Usually a letter is sent to CMA member companies in
a targeted state urging participation.
It is signed by
President Roland,
Further, he and Vice President Geraldine
Cox are sought after as speakers and as representatives to
meet local reporters in all media branches.
t
Obviously, a great deal of contact is maintained by letter
and telephone, plus visits to CMA by state group leaders.
The Local Leadership Newsletter is one of our prime means
of contact.
Copies of the last two issues will be distributed
at the Board Meeting.
One summarizes the Second Annual Meeting
of State Organizations.
The other analyzes on page one the
critiques of attendees at the meeting.
It also provides in­
sight into the input we receive from the groups and the cross­
fertilization taking place.
Since the first issue,
January/
February 1982, circulation has grown to 1700 from approximately
800 as state groups and CMA member companies have requested
additional copies.
Originally, it was thought four issues a year would suffice.
The amount of information forced us to produce six.
We now are
faced with the possibility of issuing 10 and probably 12 a year
to report all the activities on a more timely basis.
CMA 038022
-3Despite economic conditions, attendance at the Second
Annual Meeting of State Organizations was down less than nine
percent.
Those attending were most enthusiastic and look
forward to the Third Annual to be held in conjunction with
CMA's Semiannual Meeting in New York this coming November.
They were pleased that Lou Fernandez spoke at the dinner
meeting, just as they were that Bill Simeral did so the
first year.
Your attention is called to the critiques of
the meeting in the Newsletter.
In September, Corky Caldwell reported to you on general­
ized plans for a CMA membership drive.
It was decided then
to delay implementation until the economic climate improved.
Meanwhile, progress is being made on the development of mater­
ials to be used.
We are not depending on ideas generated
solely within CMA but also are studying campaign materials
used by other organizations.
Hopefully, 1983 will show
enough economic improvement to launch a drive.
Shortly, research will begin for the production of our
third analysis of 41 states considered to be of prime interest
to the chemical industry.
This is a statistical study which
ranks each state as to the chemical industry's:
e
e
e
e
Shipments in dollars
Value added
Number of employees
Percent of employees to all manufacturing employees
Percent of employees to state population
Number of CMA member companies
Number of CMA member company plants
Number of CMA member companies with S100million
or
more in sales. (Companies not identified.)
A second portion of the study shows participation, or
lack thereof, by CMA member companies represented in those
states with viable organizations.

process according to broad categories based on average
molecular weight.
CRAC developed a comprehensive plan to portray the bene­
fits of the proposed PMN exemption rules to various audi­
ences.
These audiences could affect the outcome of the

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
WILLIAM M. STOVER
TAXATION;
TAX AND BUDGET DEVELOPMENTS
Following the November mid-term Congressional elections. President
Reagan sought to regain legislative momentum in Washington by returning
to the area of tax and budget issues where he had won substantial victories
during his first 19 months in office.
In an effort to restore public enthusiasm for his economic program,
the President proposed to accelerate the scheduled third year individual
tax rate cut from July to January of 1983. However, strong early warnings
from Republican Leaders on Capitol Hill convinced him that he did not have
the votes to support such a step. Congressional concern over rising
unemployment and Federal deficit figures cast serious doubt on whether any
tax program could be passed in the post-election Special Session.
The President also moved to demonstrate his concern over unemployment
and the Administration's willingness to develop an effective jobs program.
Sensing that the highway program was the only available legislative vehicle
that could be passed in the post-election session, the President threw the
full weight of his office behind the Transportation Department's proposal
to extend the Highway Trust Fund and to increase the Federal excise tax on
gasoline by 5 cents a gallon - these revenues intended to complete and re­
build the nation's bridges and highways. On December 6, the House passed
the Administration's proposal with relatively few changes and Senate approval
was expected to follow, but not without a fight.
TAXATION;
DISC UNDER REVIEW
Behind the scenes, the Administration was confronting another major
issue of tax and trade policy. In early September, the U.S. Trade Ambassador's
office represented before the GATT Council in Geneva that the Administration
would introduce legislation to meet the objections to the Domestic Inter­
national Sales Corporation (DISC) provisions of the Internal Revenue Coda
voiced by European and Canadian members.
It was reported that in the meeting
of the Administration's Cabinet Council just before Thanksgiving there were
strong differences over the proper scope of any legislation to amend or to
replace the DISC provisions. Trade Ambassador Brock and Commerce Secretary
Baldridge strongly supported maintaining U.S. tax incentives for trade
similar to DISC. Equally strong in their opposition to DISC and any continued
tax support for American exports were Treasury Secretary Regan and Budget
Director stockman.
In view of this disagreement, the Cabinet Council deferred
taking final action on this issue.
CMA 038039
Throughout tha fall, business representatives in Washington have moved
to develop a united position on DISC.
In general there is a strong consensus
for continued tax incentives for u.S. exports at least equal to DISC.
Since
there is currently no legislation which has Administration support, the business
community has maintained unity through adherence to common principles to be
included in amendatory legislation.
CMA has been active in the effort of business and allied trade representa­
tives to maintain an effective tax program for exports. Our Tax Policy Committee
has reviewed and rearticulated our position on DISC so that our spokesmen can
continue to participate in the dialogue on this crucial issue.
ENERGY:
CONGRESSIONAL "QUICK FIX" SOUGHT ON NATURAL GAS PRICES
A series of bills have been introduced during the post-election session
that would essentially freeze the wellhead prices of natural gas and extend
price controls. Legislation proposed in both Houses would also provide
assistance to the elderly and those on fixed or low income who are adversely
impacted by increased natural gas prices. Some legislative proposals further
abrogated existing contracts by calling for the renegotiation of certain
provisions or altering of the price escalator clauses.
Proponents of accelerated and complete deregulation of natural gas are
now faced with re-regulation pressures. Various citizen and labor groups are
suggesting that natural gas decontrol is a matter of "heating or eating," and
that rhetoric is being taken up by a number of Congressional Members.
"Dear
Colleague" letters are being circulated, and a concerted effort is being made
to attach language that would freeze gas prices to either the highway/gasoline
excise tax measure or a continuing resolution for appropriations.
The Senate Finance Committee has been the forum for a good deal of the
debate on whether the highway tax should be amended to include a natural gas
price freeze. The House has already passed a different version of a highway
gasoline excise tax to increase jobs. Senate floor action on the highway
tax is expected to begin December 13 or 14, and that bill could be the target
of a natural gas control floor amendment. Senator Thomas F. Eagleton (D-MO)
is spearheading the drive. The Administration has not taken a visibly active
role in opposition to the various legislative proposals that would reregulate
gas on an interim basis, but a Presidential veto could occur if a highway tax
bill passes that is loaded down with "negative" amendments.
Several key members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
have expressed opposition on jurisdictional and procedural grounds to any
"quick fix” approach to the complex issue of natural gas pricing. A hearing
on pending legislation has been scheduled for December 13 in that Committee,
but the limited witness list is heavily weighted with Senators and groups
that advocate a gas price freeze.
CMA 038040
On the House side, a hearing has been scheduled for December 15 in the
Fossil and Synthetic Fuels Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee. Only Members have been invited to testify. Full Committee
Chairman John D. Dingell (D-MI-16) and Subcommittee Chairman Philip R. Sharp
(D-IN-10) have generally indicated that a "quick fix" approach is not appro­
priate and that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should deal with
natural gas issues in the short-term.
CMA has sent to every Senator and every House Member a letter in opposition
to freezing of natural gas wellhead prices and extending of price controls. As
part of a coalition effort, we are also meeting with key Senators to discuss
the deficiencies of existing law regarding natural gas and the need to deal with
natural gas issues in a comprehensive manner in the next Congress.
ENVIRONMENT:
CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENT UNLIKELY
In the Congressional post-election session there has been no action on
amendments to the Clean Air Act despite statements by President Reagan and
Administration officials that continue to cite this as a top economic priority.
White House pressure for a bill has not materialized.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker and other Senate leaders interested
in Clean Air Act amendment needed to be convinced by the White House -- not
just industry — that passage of a bill this year is essential. But several
very controversial issues made agreement on a "short bill" impossible. Thus,
the only Senate vehicle continues to be the unsatisfactory bill reported
November 15 by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, S. 3041
(Report No. 97-666). This bill, otherwise known as the "Stafford Bill", is
opposed by the industry coalition as well as the Administration. The Section
112 (hazardous air pollutant), acid rain and PSD (Prevention of Significant
Deterioration) provisions are especially damaging.
Since the November 4 re-election of Environment Committee Chairman
Robert Stafford (R-VT) who would shepherd S. 3041 on the Senate floor, he has
shown no interest in further consideration. There already are indications
that Environment Committee staff are preparing "improvements" for the bill
next year. The Senate Committee's loss of two northwestern members replaced
by another New Englander and a mid-westerner probably will be helpful to
industry next year.
In the House, the industry and Administration-supported Luken Bill H.R.
5252, (severely damaged during mark-up relative to PSD and Section 112) has
been pending in the Energy and Commerce Committee since August. In the new
Congress, it is unclear whether the Committee balance of power will remain
the same, or how and when a comprehensive Clean Air bill might be introduced.
Furthermore, we do not know whether Congressman James Broyhill (R-NC)
can continue to prevent passage of a Committee bill containing adverse PSD
CMA 038041
or Section 112 provisions. We do know that Congressman Billy Tauzin (D-LA)
intends to actively address Section 112 again. Tauzin co-sponsored with
Congressman James Florio (D-MJ) the Section 112 automatic listing/delisting
amendment to H.R. 5252.
It is entirely possible that this Committee will
have an even stronger environmental tilt next year.
I
I
By mid-1983, the effort will be made to pass some type of Clean Air
Act amendment in order to stave off EPA enforcement of sanctions in areas
not attaining primary ambient air quality standards. These sanctions,
including construction bans and withholding of Federal funds for transporta­
tion and sewage treatment projects, become effective December 31, 1982 but
are not immediately enforceable.
ENVIRONMENT;
CLEAN WATER ACT AMENDMENTS STMJ-ED
f
Earlier this year EPA leaders determined there was not enough time for
Congress to consider a comprehensive package of Clean Water Act amendments
that they had proposed. As a result, the agency advanced a set of scaleddown amendments in the hope of making some changes now. However, the
announcement of the special post-election session roused some hopes that
time might be available for consideration of a more comprehensive package.
EPA's sudden switch in tactics created confusion over what they want in the
way of amendments.
t
I
I
Under the short bill, EPA is considering major changes to the pretreat­
ment program, NPDES permits for 10 years with a "reopener clause”, partial
delegation of the NPDES program to the states, BAT deadline extension to
July 1, 1988 with the possible option of 36 to 42 months to comply with the
BAT deadlines, and the consideration of dams as point sources.
Also being considered is a study of the BAT modifications issue, which
is of prime importance to the chemical industry. The study provision is a
recognition that the BAT issue is important, but the chemical industry feels
that a modification scheme should be legislated now.
The senate Environment and Public Works Committee, chaired by Senator
Robert Stafford (R-VT), held a general business meeting on December 9 and did
not consider or report on any of the comprehensive Clean water amendments,
with only a very short time remaining for Congress to take action, it appears
unlikely that any clean water amendments will pass this year. Adding to this
conclusion is the plan by Senator John Chafee (R-RI), chairman of the Environ­
mental Pollution Subcommittee, to hold a hearing on December 15, focusing on
the future of the Clean Water Act and public opinion polls. Senator Chafee
has indicated that clean water amendments will be his number one priority in
1983 and he will try to report amendments from his subcommittee by March 15.
The Government Relations Committee's Clean Water Act Task Group will con­
tinue to work for the necessary legislative changes, particularly to the Best
Available Technology (BAT) and pretreatment programs through an aggressive
Hill contacts and focused communications program. To assist in these efforts-,

authorized appropriations for twa years and makes significant changes in many
sections of RCRA. Before final passage, the House agreed to a substitute which
altered the bill originally reported by the House Energy and Commerce Committee
and incorporated modifications advocated by the House Public Works and Trans­
portation Committee. The revisions contained in this substitute solved many,
but not all, of the problems that CMA initially had with the bill.
The House also agreed by voice vote to three amendments that were offered
on the floor. The first, offered by Mr. Fifthian (D-IND), will increase to 90
percent the share of clean-up costs provided by the Superfund for waste sites
owned by a State or municipality but operated by a private contractor. An
amendment by Mr. Rinaldo (R-NJ) will increase the felony penalties under RCRA
and an amendment by Mr. Dannemeyer (R-CAL) will clarify the eligibility of
courts to award costs. By recorded votes, the House rejected amendments by
Mr. Gramm (D-TX) to restore the Small Quantity Generator exemption and by
Mr. Dannemeyer (R-CAL) to delete the section which broadens common law pro­
visions.
The action shifted to the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee
on Environmental Pollution which reported a new package of RCRA amendments on
September 23. Since a number of issues contained in this amendments package
are very controversial (landfill van, mandatory inspections and small generator
inclusion), the Committee staff spent the next couple of months attempting to
develop a consensus on language. Under pressure to reach a consensus on these
important issues. Senator Robert Stafford (R-VT) set the RCRA amendments aside
until 1983. Senator John Chafee has indicated that he will make RCRA amendments
his number two priority in 1983 and will try to report a bill from his sub­
committee by the end of March.
REGULATORY REFORM LEGISLATION PROBABLY STALLED
Very little possibility now exists that H.R. 746, the Omnibus Regulatory
Reform Bill, will be passed in the closing hours of the 97th Congress. The
business coalition which supports passage of this legislation had apparently
secured House leadership support for a compromise that is close to the acceptable
language of S. 1080 which passed the Senate last spring. This compromise would
be presented to the House by an amendment in the nature of a substitute which
would be offered by Congressman Sam M. Hall (D-TX) and Congressman Tom Kindness
CMA 038043
t

Late breaking opposition m the House Rules Committee to granting a
rule to permit floor consideration of H.R. 746 and the Hall/Kindness amendment
has all but foreclosed the possibility of passage in the 97th Congress.
j
j
PATENT TERM RESTORATION BLOCKED IN RULES COMMITTEE
Passage of H.R. 6444, the Patent Term Restoration Act, is only a dim
possibility in the post-election session of Congress. This important legislation would extend the term of a patent by up to 7 years for the period during
which commercial use of a product or process is delayed because of government
mandated testing and review.
The principal obstacle to passage of H.R. 6444 is obtaining an appropriate
rule from the House Committee on Rules to bring this bill up for a vote on the
House floor.
It is anticipated that H.R. 6444, which earlier received only
4 votes less than the two-thirds required for passage of bills considered on
suspension of the rules, would then be passed by the House. The business
coalition and CMA are seeking a modified closed rule which would permit
consideration of the bill and germane amendments on the House floor.
j
j
I
The outlook is bleak because two powerful Rules Committee members
(Pepper and Bolling) oppose the bill, as does House Speaker O'Neill.
TRANSPORTATION:
FILIBUSTER THREATENS MARITIME REFORM BILL
The biggest obstacle to passage of a maritime reform bill in the post­
election session seems to be a threatened filibuster by Senator Howard M.
Metzenbaum (D-OH). Senator William Proxmire (D-WI) has indicated that he
will support an effort to prevent passage of the legislation, and Senators
Max Baucus (D-MT) and J. James Exon (D-NE) may also register opposition.
Previous opposition to the bill by Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC) has been with­
drawn. Even though there is only limited opposition to the shipper/carrier
agreed upon bill, sufficient time may not exist to consider the bill. The
Senate leadership have advised Surface Transportation Subcommittee Chairman
Slade Gorton (R-WA) that floor time will be scheduled to bring up the measure,
but is is evident, given the other^issues present and items scheduled, that
there may not be enough time for a floor vote.
Floor action is scheduled for December 10, yet the bill could well be
carried on the agenda for the remainder of the session. The Senate bill under
consideration has been revised and more closely reflects the House passed version.
The revisions are supported by CMA, the shipper/carrier coalition, and the
Administration. Additional CMA proposed technical and substantive amendments
have also been basically incorporated into the substitute Senate version.
Clarifying floor statements have further been prepared and the bill has, in
essence, been "pre-conferenced" with Members and staff of the House Merchant
Marine and Judiciary Committees.
m
I
I
CMA 038044
In the event that a maritime reform bill is not adopted during the postelection session, there is little likelihood of a bill going forward
immediately in the next Congress. Consensus among coalition members is
doubtful, and the arduous drafting process to date has left in question many of
the basic principles involved, there is no doubt, however, that shippers have
averted what was initially an unbalanced carrier relief bill. Nearly a year
of negotiations with legislative sponsors, carrier representatives and the
Administration have resulted in substantial agreement on the direction of
legislation affecting the U.S. maritime fleet. It is believed by all parties
that progress has been made.
TRADE:
RECIPROCITY LEGISLATION
There is concern in the Congress about the $20 billion trade deficit with
Japan and a growing concern about U.S. trade policy. The failure of the GATT
Ministerial meeting in late November 1982 has caused a further deepening of this
concern.
Senator John Danforth (R-MO) of the Senate Finance Committee and Chairman
of its International Trade Subcommittee, focused Congressional trade policy
interest in "The Reciprocal Trade and Investment Act of 1982," S. 2094.
It
provides for Presidential authority to deal with unfair trade practices, pro­
tection of intellectual property rights, and inequitable investment restrictions
by other governments.
The bill was generally acceptable to both the Senate and the House on its
merits. The Senate Finance Committee reported the bill, but potentially
crippling amendments threatened and the maneuvering to eliminate them prevent d
a floor vote. The bill was than added by the Senate to a House-passed
miscellaneous tariff bill, H.R. 4568 (The International Trade and investment Act).
However, the House Ways and Means Committee did not act on S. 2094, except to
hold hearings.
The chemical industry took a great deal of interest in this major piece of
trade legislation. A number of chemical companies were leaders in an industry
coalition effort to get the bill passed. CMA adopted a policy of approval of
the bill, and opposed amendments. Of particular concern was the proposed Frenzel
amendment, H.R. 4761 (Section 124 of the Trade Act of 1974), to include extension
of the President's authority to further reduce tariffs.
The 98th Congress will take up legislation of this nature. At this time,
it is not clear whether it will be in the same form as S. 2094.
In any case,
the new Congress is likely to be more protectionist than the last one. This
poses serious problems, particularly if the bill requiring all cars sold in
the United States to use up to 90 percent American parts and labor, (H.R. 5135),
continues its current popularity in the Congress.
TRADE
BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES
The United States has established a program of negotiating bilateral
CMA 038045
investment treaties with developing countries. Egypt and Panama have recently
signed such treaties. There are twenty-six other countries under active
consideration by the Trade Representative's Office for future treaties. CMA
has been provided with the list of prospective countries.
The CMA International Trade Committee believes the BIT program holds
considerable promise for resolving some of the foreign investment problems of
the future. For this reason, an active liaison has been established between
the CMA Investment Policy Task Group and the Trade Representative's Office.
This group expects to provide advice and aid to the Trade Representative's
Office as additional treaties are negotiated. The industry's ability to be
effective in the investment area is enhanced by the membership of Mr. Dexter
Baker (Air Products) on Ambassador Brock's Investment Policy Advisory Committee.
TRADE: . REPORT OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES FEDERAL POLICY
Formation of an Administration policy on the export of hazardous sub­
stances remains active and close to a conclusion. On February 17, 1981,
President Reagan revoked a President Carter Executive Order which put controls
on the export of hazardous or restricted products. The major stake for the
chemical industry was about 30 percent of $1.2 billion of exports which are not
registered in the United States. The President, at the same time, requested
from the Secretaries of Commerce and State a proposal to improve the export
notification system already existing in various laws.
A joint proposal from Secretaries Baldridge and Haig was cleared by a
Trade Policy Committee chaired by Trade Representative Ambassador Brock.
The close liaison of the International Trade Committee with the two agencies
in development of the proposal was continued with the visit of a small delegation
'to the White House staff person responsible for the White House course of action.
Subsequently, the draft proposal for a new President Reagan Executive Order was
published,
it calls for new regulations and legislative proposals. The draft
proposal is acceptable to the chemical industry in its present form. Con­
siderable difficulty lies ahead due to the complexity of the many existing laws
and regulations to be affected.
TRADE:
U.S./MEXICAN PETROCHEMICAL DISCUSSIONS
The U.S. Department of Commerce has been fully informed by CMA that petro­
chemical difficulties lie ahead between the U.S. and Mexico. This will result
from a large expansion of petrochemical capacity in Mexico, Canada and Saudi
Arabia in the face of existing, extreme overcapacity in the traditional pro­
ducing countries. After a discussion between President Reagan and President
Portillo of Mexico, a Joint Commission on Coirenerce and Trade (JCCT) was formed
and industry discussions on five sectors, including pertochemicals, were agreed
upon.
CMA subsequently provided a group of expert advisors to the government who
are participating in a government-controlled advisory committee. This group is
I
k
CMA 038046
currently working on objectives to be sought by the U.S. government in future
discussions. There have been two government-to-government orientation meetings
without industry advisors. Further discussions have delayed until the new de
la Madrid administration is fully functioning.
The CMA International Trade Committee has been maintaining close liaison
with government on the petrochemical discussions. It has constructed its set
of objectives for the discussions which were approved by the Executive Committee
and forwarded to the Department of Commerce. These objectives will be considered
fully along with those of the official advisors group.
Early in November, it was discovered that the U.S. and Mexican governments
had quietly negotiated a new bilateral trade agreement. The intent of the agree­
ment was to reduce Mexican subsidization of industrial goods in return for
application of the injury test in U.S. countervailing duty actions against
Mexican imports. This injury test is not now applied to such imports because
Mexico does not belong to the GATT and therefore, cannot sign the GATT sub­
sidies code. On learning of the trade agreement, CMA immediately made known its
views that the industry was not properly consulted on the trade agreement. The
Trade Representative's Office convened a small meeting within two days, with
representatives of several industries present, to discuss the text of the agree­
ment. On hearing of this development, the Mexican government withdrew its
support of the agreement. The U.S. Department of Commerce apparently intends to
submit the agreement to the industry consultative process and approach Mexico
again, while the draft trade agreement had the well intentioned objective of
reducing Mexican subsidization, the agreement a3 written clearly would not
accomplish this.
TSCA;
OTA REPORT ON PMN PROGRAM EXPECTED IN JANUARY
The final report on OTA's review of the quality and quantity of the infor­
mation contained in premanufacture notifications submitted to EPA under section 5
of TSCA is expected to be completed early in 1983. OTA undertook this review
at the request of congressman Florio (D-NJ). Expectations were that the final
report, depending on the study results, might be used by Mr. Florio in a
campaign to require a fixed set of testing for all new chemicals, similar to
the Europeans' 6th Amendment and OECD's Minimum Premarket Data. Preliminary
indications are, however, that OTA's conclusions do not seriously attack EPA's
administration of the PMN program.
TSCA:
GAO STUDY OF PMNS UNDERWAY
Congressman Florio recently requested another study of the PMN program,
this one by the Government Accounting Office (GAO). This study will analyze
EPA's process for reviewing PMNs and making decisions of unreasonable risk; the
level of EPA's enforcement efforts and on site inspections regarding PMNs; and
the procedural and policy differences between the U.S. and Europeans approach,
including testing, exemptions and follow up procedures. One part of the GAO
study is expected to be done by February, with the balance to be completed by.
the end of the summer.
CMA 038047
TSCA:
GAO STUDY ON SECTION 4 TESTING COMPLETED
In the meantime, GAO has completed a study for the Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee on EPA's Implementation of Selected Aspects of TSCA.
This study focuses on EPA's use and legality of negotiated/voluntary testing
agreements in lieu of formal test rules under section 4 of TSCA; the asbestos
control program; and procedures for conducting risk assessments. The GAO
study is due for release on December 22, 1982, and no "bombshells" are expected.
It may be factored into TSCA reauthorization hearings held in 1983.
I
TSCA REAUTHORIZATION/OVERSIGHT HEARINGS IN 1983
Congressman Florio (D-NJ) anticipates a comprehensive review of EPA's
implementation of TSCA in reauthori2ation hearings in the 98th Congress. No
dates have been set, and all Subcommittee chairmanships and jurisdictions must
be approved early in 1983. Nevertheless, Mr. Florio is expected to continue
to chair the Subcommittee with responsibility for TSCA (presently Commerce and
Transportation). He is likely to hold TSCA reauthorization and oversight hearings
in the February-to-March timeframe, depending in part on his schedule for dealing
with other important issues before his Subcommittee including Superfund, RCRA,
groundwater, railroad legislation and the like. Mr. Florio is said to be weighing
amendments to TSCA and CMA is preparing to counter efforts to open up a law
which, given reasonable implementation, is a viable and effective approach to
regulating hazardous chemical substances.
In the Senate, on the other hand, some uncertainties surround the Environment
and Public Works Committee. Senators Slade Gorton (R-wash.) (who chaired the
Toxic Substances and Environmental Oversight Subcommittee) and Frank Murkowski
(R-Alaska) have chosen to leave this Committee. Replacing them will be
Senators Gordon Humphrey (R-NH) and Dave Durenberger (R-MINN.), one of who may
chair the Subcommittee with jurisdiction over TSCA formerly headed by Mr. Gorton.
However, the Subcommittee jurisdictions have not yet been settled, and some
rearranging is possible. Thus it is too early to know whether, when and by whom
TSCA reauthorization hearings will be held in 1983 by the Senate.
OSHA REFORM;
I
TASK GROUP CONTINUING EFFORTS
A CMA Task Group continues to develop recommendations for reform of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act. Key issues being developed include
definitions, general duty clause, advance notice of proposed rulemaking, per­
formance-based standards, on-site inspections, self-regulation, employee com­
plaints, targeting safety inspections, contested citations, and state plans.
The recommendations are being reviewed by CMA's Occupational Safety and Health
Committee and are expected to be finalized early in 1983. Thereafter, CMA will
work with the broad-based industry coalition to seek amendments to the OSH Act
when the time is deemed appropriate to achieve successful results. Expectations
for the 98th Congress are not encouraging.

CMA 038048
STATE AFFAIRS REPORT
Legislative Activity
Legislative activity during the last few months of 1982 was generally
slow since most states had adjourned before the November elections. However
lame duck sessions continued well into December in California, Massachusetts,
New York and Michigan to resolve unfinished business, particularly related
to budget shortfalls.
In addition, the New Jersey legislature continued to
meet in their regular 1982/1983 session. Among its other distinctions. New
Jersey will be the only legislature to carry bills over into next year.
Sy early January, the vast majority of state legislatures will be
reorganized and beginning the very busy first year of their biennium. Legis­
lative activity is expected to be extremely heavy during the first six months
of 1983 and will probably peak in April.
State Election Results
The November elections brought much larger shifts for the Democrats in
the states than it did in Congress. The Democratic Party now has complete control of 34 state legislatures in addition to 34 governorships. Further,
Democrats now control both the legislature and the governorship in 24 states.
The situation in individual states is as follows:
The Democrats captured legislative houses from the Republicans in Delaware,
Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Montana, Ohio, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Washington.
Republicans will control both chambers in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho,
Indiana, Kansas, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
The parties will share control of both chambers in Montana, New York,
North Dakota, and Pennsylvania.
The Democrats wrested control of the governor's office from the Republicans
in the following states: Alaska, Arkansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada,
Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin.
The Republicans scored upset gubernatorial victories in California and N w
Hampshire.
Committee and Task Group Activity
Major projects by the SASC and its task groups were geared toward ensuring
that the state affairs professionals in the industry are adequately prepared for
the onslaught of the 1983 legislative sessions. The following represent major
CMA 038049
activities that are distinct from particular issues or bills or regulations
which are discussed in some detail subsequently.
Three regional state affairs seminars were held in New York, Atlanta and
Chicago during October and November. Total attendance was approximately 200
and interaction with CIC's and other state groups was high. SASC task groups
developed and presented program segments on hazardous waste, right to know,
hazardous materials transportation, state cancer policies and air and water
quality.
In addition, major corporate, EPA regional and state lobbyist
representatives were featured speakers. Although numerous ideas for improving
the programs have developed from these sessions, these seminars represented
another significant step in CMA's State Affairs program outreach efforts.
Another series of seminars is contemplated in late 1983.
The Network Task Group is involved in several projects designed to enhance the
industry's ability to impact legislative and regulatory activities in specific
states. First, the CMA State Network formed during 1982 is being reviewed and
strengthened to ensure that key industry issues. The existing network is being
surveyed as to how participants utilized the material distributed to them in
1982 and what kinds of assistance would be most helpful in 1983.
In addition,
a state government relations resource survey is in the draft stage which is
designed to identify chemical industry lobbying resources in key states and to
pinpoint individuals and organizations that can be utilized in state activities
Finally, the task group is following and encouraging CIC development in states
such as Massachusetts, Kentucky and Florida.
The Electronic Services Task Group completed contract discussions with the
vendor for state computer based legislative and regulatory tracking services.
Discussions continued through December on implementation of the agreement.
STATE ISSUES UPDATE
State Right to Know remains legislatively active in California and New
Jersey.
In California, the list of covered substances (approximately 700)
has been finalized by the Labor Department and the worker right to know law
will go into effect on February 21, 1983. At the local level, community right
to know continues to spread. Sacramento council passed such an ordinance 9-0
in early December. Other localities that are active include Contra Costa, Santa
Clara, San Diego and Orange County.
New Jersey remains the centerpiece of the debate in the states on right to
know. SB 1670, the first combined state level worker and community right to
know in the country, was the subject of extensive public hearings around the state
in October. These hearings were characterized by highly emotional testimony,
CMA 038060
demonstrations, ar.d other media directed activities. The instigators of these
activities were local environmental/citizen groups, and, to a lesser extent,
organized labor. Although it appeared originally that committee markup might
take place in November or December, further action has been postponed until
after the first of the year.
In the interim, the New Jersey Chemical Industry
Council and Chamber of Commerce are working jointly on industry's response.
In 1983, we expect right to know legislation to be introduced in Minnesota,
Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas, Oregon, Illinois, Louisiana, Ohio,
Indiana, Florida and West Virginia.
The State Affairs Special Committee Hazards Communication Task Group and
the Occupational Safety and Health State Activities Task Group have completed
work on the Right to Know information Packet. This material has been distri­
buted to key State Affairs contacts in the states. The packet contains material
on occupational cancer; existing industry programs; appropriate government role;
community right to know; "and also contains the right to know issues analysis
booklet prepared earlier this year.
Hazardous Wastes
The Hazardous waste Disposal Task Group continued to be involved in several
key projects directed toward increasing the chemical industry's effectiveness
on hazardous waste issues during 1983. They include:
The development of a supplement on compensation/liability issues
for inclusion with the existing State Superfund — Issues and
Perspective booklet. This is designed to more fully address
strict, joint and several liability and causation issues raised
in the Section 301 (e) Federal Tort Law Study.
Completion of the first stage of the state by state data gathering
effort on hazardous waste.
Information has been assembled, by
state, on Superfund implementation, siting and overall hazardous
waste management.
Working with the EMC Hazardous Waste Support Task Group on develop­
ing a mechanism to provide direct technical and legal support to
industry representatives on state hazardous waste bills and/or
regulations.
Legislative activity on hazardous waste during the last few months of 1982
was limited to only a few states.
The outlook for state Superfund in Massachusetts remained uncertain as the
year ended. Although industry was dissatisfied with the King Administration's
CMA 038061
revised proposal, which was circulating in December, the perception of prob­
able legislation that would emerge in 1983 was even worse.
Michigan enacted HB 4715 into law during November. This Superfund bill
was by and large acceptable to industry although the actual source of financing
in future years is still not clear.
Discussions have continued in New Jersey on AB 1900, which contains compre­
hensive amendments to the state's spill fund. There is a good chance that the
tax will move away from feedstock to some sort of waste end fee.
It is likely
that the fund will remain a combined oil/chemical spill fund. Action is not
likely until 1983.
Industry groups in Tennessee continue to work on drafts of State Superfund
and siting bills for consideration in 1983.
In California, the Department of Health Services continued to push forward
its proposed regulations to limit the landfilling of certain categories of
hazardous waste. The current regulations represent a marked improvement over
the Executive order originally put forward by Governor Brown in 1981.
Air and Water Quality
A priority for the State Affairs Special Committee Environmental Task Group
for 1983 is the development of a policy paper on state regulation of hazardous
air pollutants. The task group has begun preliminary work on the concepts
involved and will work with the appropriate EMC groups to reach an acceptable
position. This activity has been spurred on by the California Air Resources
Board's attempt to finalize hazardous air pollutant regulations by the end of
1982. The California legislature unanimously passed a resolution urging them
to hold off final action until the new Administration took office.
The task group will also be working with the EMC Groundwater Task Group
on promoting CMA's new groundwater policy and strategy in the states during
1983.
Finally, the task group will be monitoring cancer and other chronic
disease issues in the states and will work to ensure that the industry's
technical expertise is made available where appropriate.
Hazardous Materials Transportation
CMA staff and member company representatives participated in a hazardous
materials transportation conference in Denver sponsored by the National Conference
of State Legislatures. This conference was part of the continuing dialogue on
the appropriate roles of Federal, State and local governments in regulating the
transportation of hazardous materials.
i
CMA 038052
The principle transportation issue in the states continues to be Good
Samaritan.
Pennsylvania HB 50 has been reported out of conference committee
and is expected to pass before the end of the year. Discussions are continuing
with the inter-industry coalition on advocating a consensus Good Samaritan bill
in 1983.
Progress has been good and we anticipate a coordinated, broad based
effort to pass this legislation to take place in many states next year. To
support this effort, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Task Group is
working with the Distribution Committee on developing Good Samaritan advocacy
materials for distribution to our state contacts.
Finally, the proposed Alabama regulation requiring prenotification of
shipments of hazardous waste has been eliminated.

EXHIBIT P
REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS
RICHARD L.
WILSON
Introduction - At the Board Meeting in Chicago in October,
a definitive CMA communications plan was presented.
That
plan is now in operation.
A Government Affairs Task Group of the Communications Commit­
tee is working with the Legislative Communications Task Group
of the Government Relations Committee to develop a communica­
tions program for the local level.
Among their primary goals
is development of methods for creating a structure that will
help channel communications aimed at changing the climate of
public opinion in key congressional districts.
Initial efforts
have already begun to identify issues, develop messages and
explore delivery approaches.
Public Compensation - This major concern looms in the recently
convened 98th session of Congress.
Because it is so emo­
tionally charged, this issue has the potential to drive the
public's perception of the industry to new depths,
A preli­
minary public compensation communications plan is already in
place.
Economic Briefing - Board Chairman William G. Simeral
appeared at CMA1s annual economic press briefing, held in New
York City December 2, reflecting CMA's commitment to presenting
key industry representatives to the press.
Reporters were told
that the economic health of the industry remains poor and that
prospects for a rapid recovery are dim.
When the upturn does
come, Mr. Simeral predicted that the industry will be in good
position to take advantage of it through improved productivity
and rising expenditures for research and development.
Advertising - The print advertising budget for the 1982-83
fiscal year was reduced from $2.2 million to $900,000 reflect­
ing industry's economic difficulties.
In line with other CMA
activities, the advertising program will become targeted and
issue-oriented.
The print program will address priority
issues, such as public compensation, superfund reauthorization,
hazardous waste disposal and clean water.
The Advertising Task Group will work in tandem with the new
Government Affairs Task Group toward developing regional
CMA 038054

J
public relations programming supported by local advertising.
A prototype prepared for the 1982 lame duck session of Congress
was targeted at Troy, New York, and several cities in West
Virginia.
Focusing on the Clean Water Act, the advertisements
sought to persuade readers to support a particular position
and to send that message to their congressman.
J. Walter
Thompson is working on this program with CMA and its outside
public relations counsel.
Education - The department plans
j
i
i
to work with Catalyst Award
winners in developing print materials' that emphasize the posi­
tive aspects of science.
CMA will place these articles with
national publications.
A pilot program using a top Catalyst
recipient as a speaker on a media tour is planned for January
1983.
Another possiblity is that radio interviews using educators will be sent to stations already requesting our materials
on industry-related topics.
In addition, CMA plans to publish
a career information booklet using advisory essays from these
educators.
j
Consumer Information - The section participated at the National
Association of Extension Home Economists convention in October,
distributing more than 2,000 pieces of information on chemicals
and critical issues.
CHEMM-PAK awards were presented to two
national winners from Kentucky and Missouri.
At the National Association of Farm Broadcasters convention in
Kansas City in November, CMA provided ten industry representa­
tives to be taped for interviews.
Eighty five-minute TV and 208
radio tapes were made by 45 broadcasters with an estimated
listening audience of 10 million.
Total air time amounted to
31 hours.
i
i
i
The first winners of the CheM-Agra awards for broadcasts on
agricultural topics were announced at the convention.
First,
second and third place winners received 31,000, $500 and $250,
respectively, to donate to the non-profit organization of their
choice.
i
i
i
f
Public Service Announcements - The department will produce four
30-second PSAs for television during the next few months.
They
will reflect actions that the industry is taking in the public
interest on major issues.
9
Publications - CMA News plans a year-end report that will sum­
marize major legislative and regulatory activity of the year
and provide an outlook on congressional action to come.
Conti­
nuing its special report series, ChemEcology's December/January
issue will focus on the positive manner in which the industry
responded to the Livingston, La., train derailment.
In conjunction with the technical department, this section is
coordinating production of a primer on ground water.
It will be
available early in 1983, primarily to fill requests for informa­
tion generated by media tours.

TREASURER'S REPORT
Mr. Herman reported that the year-end report showing actual revenue and
expenses versus budget for the 1983/84 fiscal year is being finalized and should
be distributed by the end of June. Pending that final report, current estimates
indicate the use of reserves in the amount of approximately $100,000. Mr.
Herman reported that invoices for 1984/85 Association dues are being mailed
and that prompt payment would be appreciated.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Mr. Holmer deferred a separate report of the Executive Committee's meeting
since each of the items addressed were also to be covered by the Board at its
meeting.
SPECIAL PROGRAM ADVISORY COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS
Dr. Fernandez announced the appointment of Harry Corless of ICI Americas,
Inc. and Richard G. Askew of Phillips Chemical Company to the Special Programs
Advisory Committee (SPAC). The Executive Committee and Board had previously ap­
proved the reorganization of SPAC and authorized the appointment of two members
of the Board of Directors to serve with three CMA Vice Presidents (Technical,
Legal, and Administration) on the committee.
REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT
e
Mr. Roland reported that there had been a net increase of eight
members during the 1983/84 fiscal year.
Mr. Roland indicated that the issues of groundwater and emergency
response preparedness were receiving increased attention and that
a presentation to the Board and Executive Committee on Association
activities and proactive programs in these areas is anticipated in
the near future.
Mr. Roland presented proposed special programs on eresols, nickelcontaining catalysts and oleylamine.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded,
it was
VOTED: To approve the proposed programs
on eresols, nickel-containing catalysts
and oleylamine as set forth in Exhibit A.
SUPERFUND STATUS REPORT
Mr. stover's report, on behalf of Mr. Mobley, is attached as Exhibit B.
In addition, he highlighted:
i
CMA 038147
2249
e
May 16 testimony by Mr. Holmer on behalf of CMA before the Senate
Environmental and Public works Committee at which Mr. Sorgenti also
testified.
e
Plans for a CEO visit program with eighteen targeted members of the
Senate.
e
Activities in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, including
the mark-up of the Florio II bill expected in the latter half of
June.
e
Other House committees with jurisdiction over the Superfund bill
and prospects for their actions.
e
Need for Board members to initiate visits with members of the Senate
and the House Commerce Committee to educate them on the Superfund
issues of critical concern to the chemical industry.
There followed discussion of the Association's role in the reauthorization
process and the need to reemphasize our positions on the critical issues of
fund size; public compensation; the sources of fund revenues; and the timing
of reauthorization. There was additional discussion emphasizing the need for
sound data from EFA on the resources required in the extended Superfund program
before reauthorization should proceed and that this point should be strongly
made, particularly in the Senate.
SUPERFUND FUNDING REPORT
Mr. White's report is attached as Exhibit C.
included:
Highlights from his remarks
e
Details of the previously approved "safety valve" borrowing authority
which would make available additional funds to finance actual Superfund
site cleanup.
e
Inability of the task group to recommend any other taxing options,
including gross receipts, as acceptable alternatives.
e
Need to advocate the tax and economic impact issues to members of the
ways and Means and Finance Committees.
e
Necessity of utilizing general revenues to close any revenue gap be­
tween the approved Association position and the amounts being discussed
by the Congress.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded,
it was
VOTED: That the following provisions be
to the Association's previously approved
tion on the use of borrowing to fill any
gap between the amount of the fund to be
added
posi­
funding
financed
CMA 038148
2250
by industry taxes, general revenues, cost re­
coveries and interest; and the total amount
required for cleanup activities in any given
year:
e
Expanded borrowing authority should be considered
a "safety valve", that is, the authority to borrow
would be available only to finance actual Superfund
site cleanup expenses after the revenues in the
trust fund have been expended.
e
Expanded borrowing authority would be limited in any
given year to approximately 5350 million.
e
Repayment of amounts borrowed should be amortized
over a 10-year period. Installments of principal
and interest should be paid first from cost re­
coveries and then, to the extent needed, from trust
fund revenues.
The task group will give further consideration to the nonhazardous waste
disposal tax submitted by Mr. Belzer of Allied.
There was additional discussion on the applicability of the "Greenbrier
Procedures" to the advocacy of a gross receipts or other taxing formula. It
was agreed that the "Greenbrier Procedures" were not applicable in this case.
ECONOMIC IMPACT REPORT
Mr. Irvine's report is attached as Exhibit D. He indicated that the ■
economic impact data being developed will be adapted to individual states and
congressional districts for use in the Association's lobbying effort.
PUBLIC COMPENSATION
Mr. Browning's report is attached as Exhibit E. In Mr. Browning's absence,
Mr. Holmer reported on the Executive Committee*s discussions and actions with
respect to public compensation. He reiterated that keeping public compensation
provisions out of the Superfund reauthorization bill was a priority. Although
th administrative compensation fund was deleted in the current Florio II
Superfund proposal, a federal cause of action provision still remains which is
also unsupportable. The Executive Committee agreed that:
e
An administrative compensation fund and/or federal cause of action
continue to be opposed in the context of Superfund reauthorization.
e
Further information and analysis was required with respect to the
potential impact of a federal cause of action.
e
The recommendation contained in the task group's report to amend
CERCLA Section 104(i) to provide for more site specific health
studies and medical monitoring be approved.
1
2251
following Mr. Holmer's remarks, there was discussion of wh n the UAREP
report on waste site injuries would be released. Dr. Cox reported that as a
result of the peer review process, a final report would not be issued until
September.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded,
it was
VOTED: That the recommendation contained in
the task group's report to amend CERCLA Sec­
tion 104(i) to provide for more site specific
health studies and medical monitoring be ap­
proved .
CLEAN SITES, INC. REPORT
Chairman Fernandez presented a report on the status of the Clean Sites, Inc.
project. He expressed his appreciation to the Association's Executive Committee
and Board; individual association and member company participants (including Messrs.
Holmer, Forney, Roland, and McBrayer); the Conservation Foundation and other par­
ticipating environmental groups; and Administrator Ruckleshaus and others at EFA.
Chairman Fernandez indicated that there remained much to accomplish before the
project can be deemed a success, including engaging staff, securing the required
start up funding from the chemical and other industries and actually getting the
cleanup under way. He urged the cooperation of Association's members in working
together to accomplish the purposes of the Clean Sites project.

PROPOSED PROGRAM ON OLEYLAMINE
Problem/Background:
On November 8, 1983, the Interagency Testing
Committee (ITC) recommended that oleylamine
be considered for testing for its toxic
effects on human health. The ITC recommended
the following studies:
toxicokinetics, genotoxicity and teratogenicity.
In response to
the ITC's recommendation, EPA proposed oral
teratogenicity, dermal subchronic, and muta­
genicity tests. As a result of EPA's proposal,
oleylamine manufacturers asked CMA to set up
a program on this chemical. Accordingly, the
Special Programs Division convened,an explora­
tory meeting to discuss testing issues and
options for action.
Objectives;
The Panel will work with EPA to develop a
reasonable and sufficient response to the
ITC's recommendations for testing. The
Panel intends to evaluate the Agency's
testing recommendation in conjunction with
additional data in order to determine the
need for a testing proposal.
Recommendation;
It is proposed that the Executive Committee
accept SPAC's recommendation for approval
for this program.

SUPERFUND STATUS REPORT
LEGISLATIVE UPDATE__
By Stacey Mobley, E. I. du Pont de Nemours a Company
CONGRESS
HOUSE
Representative James Florio's (D-NJ) Subcommittee on
Commerce, Transportation and Tourism will markup his new
Superfund bill, H.R. 5640, on May 23.
It is expected that the
Subcommittee will report H.R. 5640 to the full committee.
Representative John Dingell (D-MI), Chairman of the full
Energy and Commerce Committee, who is a co-sponsor of Florio's
bill, is expected to begin consideration of Superfund after
the Memorial Day recess.
e
Speaker of the House of Representatives "Tip" O'Neill
has asked the three House committees (Energy and
Commerce, Public Works and Transportation and Ways and
Means) to complete work and have Superfund ready for
floor consideration in early August. O'Neill wants
to make Superfund a Presidential election issue against
President Reagan and the Republicans.
e
Representative Robert Roe (D-NJ), Chairman of the
Water Resources Subcommittee, Public Works and
Transportation Committee, has begun Superfund reauthor­
ization hearings. Roe, who is a co-sponsor of the
Florio bill will complete his hearings in early June.
CMA will testify at the June hearings.
The Ways and Means Committee will not begin Superfund
hearings, until mid-June on the taxing aspects of the
Florio bill.
SENATE
CMA testified before the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee on May 16. Additional hearings were held
May 23 and 24. The major Senate Superfund bill will not be
introduced until after these legislative hearings are completed.
MEDIA
The media continues to not write much about Superfund, in
general, but Senator Gary Hart is beginning to address the issue
of Superfund on a national basis.
CMA 038160
ASSOCIATIONS
CMA continues to hold regular meetings with other
industry groups which are impacted by the Superfund
legislation. Most other associations are working to
get exempted from the feedstock or waste-end tax.
They are concerned about the liability and compensa­
tion provisions.
CMA
CMA has initiated an aggressive lobbying campaign in
Washington and Congressional Districts aimed primarily
at the members of Florio's Subcommittee, the Energy
and Commerce Committee, the Ways and Means Committee
and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
We have also undertaken contacts with key members and
staff of the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee.
ENVIRONMENTALISTS
The environmentalists continue to lobby very aggressively
in the House and Senate for a very large increase in
the Superfund and for "victim's compensation".
MINISTRATION
EPA Administrator Ruckelshaus continues to advocate
that Superfund legislation should not be considered
this year until the Agency completes its study of
funding needs in December 1984.

SUPERFUNO FUNDING REPORT
Pr«s#nted by
Glann w. White, The Dow Chemical Company
June 6, 1984
I am reporting today on behalf of the Superfund Funding
Task Group in respect of its charge to study further the ARCO
gross receipts tax proposal.
The Task Group after due
consideration again rejected that tax proposal.
Previously
the Tax Policy Committee had also rejected the proposal.
Before the Executive Committee and Board of CMA at this
time is a modification to the existing position on Superfund
funding.
Specifically/ CMA would modify its existing position
to include support for:
The use of borrowing as a "safety valve" to support
actual site clean-up after the trust fund revenues
had been exhausted.
Borrowing/ in any one year, would be limited to
$350 million/ and
Repayment of any borrowings should be amortized
over a 10-year period.
Installments of principal
and interest should be paid first from cost recoveries
and then, to the extent needed, from the trust fund.
This proposal tightly limits funding as does CMA's present
position.
Earlier/ Mr. Holmer had testified on reauthorization
in the Senate and his testimony reflected an $850 million total
annual funding.
I recommend for your approval the Task Group's proposal.
I would like to further suggest that CMA get busy and
address the issue before the tax writing committees of Congress.
Legislation will soon come out of the Congressional committees
concerned with environmental issues and pass to the committees

While we can support the
CMA position, I am convinced that we must address a more

There are
They are serious
because each tax proposal can have a major adverse impact on

j
some of the companies within the industry.
Our argument can be that this industry supports reauthorizati'on at the $850 million level with a limited annual
borrowing authorization.
However, this industry does not have
the r venue capacity to fund the major societal cost of a
new welfare program.
j
J
I
No one, especially our legislators, should
be allowed to lose sight of the fact that a complete cleanup
of all hazardous waste sites in the United States is another
w lfare program.
And that becomes particularly true if the
victim compensation legislation is married to this program.
t
We must make the cogent economic arguments and make them
in terms that are both believable and realistic.
Even at a
$1.5 billion annual funding level, the chemical industry does
not collapse.
However, the real effect when the tax becomes
centered on a very narrow revenue base, of give or take seven
chemicals and give or take 12 companies, is that an erosion
begins that moves production of the particular chemicals off­
shore.
Erosion may be more pernicious than collapse.
That
CMA 038163
erosion will soon begin, because for most of the affected
chemicals there is worldwide excess capacity.
From the point-
of-view of the chemical companies, the fact that the production
may move from United States sources to foreign sources may be
good news or bad news depending upon the individual company's
worldwide capacity situation and worldwide market position.
From a United States government viewpoint, any movement of
production out of the United States defeats the revenue
raising capability of the tax, thus the tax simply won't work
as its rate goes up.

This tax commits suicide by killing its
Moreover, its erosive effect diminishes the
general income tax base as well.
The staffs of the committees
responsible for raising revenues can be made to understand
this argument.
However, we must articulate it carefully and
without overstatement, because overstatement will be followed
by complete disbelief and we cannot afford that consequence.
We can make a strong, positive argument for a waste-end
tax based on its equity and fairness.
Equity in that it
compels people to do what they ought to do, that is, simply
dispose of their waste in an environmentally safe fashion.
Fairness in that all those who dispose of waste pay a reason­
able amount of tax.
While we as an industry can fund most of a reasonable
program, we cannot fund grandiose schemes.
Such schemes must
be considered in the great revenue debates that will occur
beginning in 1984 and carry on into a new Congress and Adminis­
tration.
We must convey this message in Washington.

there are some who believe the deal has already been cut by
the Democractic majority in the House and that the Senate
will offer no effective resistance to that deal.
If this is
so, then nothing we do whatever course we decide to follow,

Rather than assume we are defeated,
I would prefer to see us proceed with an activitist campaign.

Alternate Sources of Superfund Revenue
Discussion
In April, the Executive Committee and Board of Directors approved the
recommendation of the Superfund Funding Taste Group for supplemental revenue
options for the Superfund site cleanup program. In brief, the recommendations
adopted were:
o
To impose a tax of $50 per dry weight ton on the disposal of
hazardous waste to produce the first $300 million in tax revenues
for the Superfund site cleanup program.
o
To raise revenues over $300 million: maintain the existing feedstock
taxes with three principal amendments — (a) adoption of technical
amendments package; (b) specifically exempt hydrocarbons used in
gasoline from separate taxation as chemicals; (c) freeze level of
revenues to be raised from the current taxes at approximately
$300 million per annum.
o
To continue funding from government general revenues at 12.5 percent,
or approximately $86 million per annum.
o
To provide EPA borrowing authority of up to $300 million per annum
(Task Group to develop details).
The Executive Committee and Board of Directors directed the Task Group to
study further an ARCO proposal to tax certain corporate gross receipts.
On May 16, Edwin C. Holmer testified on behalf of CMA before the Senate
Committee on Environment and Public Works on Superfund reauthorization.
In that testimony, Mr. Holmer presented a proposed funding mechanism to
match annual EPA spending needs of approximately $850 million. That
proposal includes the components discussed above, and would raise $700
million. In addition, he noted that $150 million would be provided from
cost recoveries and interest for total Superfund revenues of $850 million.
In response to the directive of the Executive Committee, the Task Group
met on May 18, 1984, to determine what is the preferred mechanism to fund,
or to finance, an additional $350 million per annum. The Executive Committee
specifically requested that the Task Group present a recommendation on
whether CMA should adopt the ARCO proposal to impose a tax on corporate
gross receipts, or if not, what alternative financing mechanisms should be
adopted to raise this additional revenue.
After extended discussion, a majority of the Task Group declined to recommend
a tax on corporate gross receipts as an appropriate means to raise $350
million. It should be noted that the Task Group was closely divided on this
issue, and that the minority strongly supported the gross receipts proposal.
In this respect. Congress may consider the gross receipts tax, the value
added tax, and other general tax increase proposals in 1985 to reduce the
Federal budget deficit.
CMA 038167
2
The Task Group agreed that the preferred mechanism to finance the next $350
million increment for the Superfund program would be to provide EPA with
"Safety Valve" borrowing authority in that amount. The Task Group modified
its previous proposal on this subject.
The basic elements of the new proposal include:
Expanded borrowing authority should be considered a "safety
valve", that is, the authority to borrow would be available only
to finance actual Superfund site cleanup expenses after the
revenues in the trust fund have been expended.
Expanded borrowing authority would be limited in any given year
to $350 million.
Repayment of amounts borrowed should be amortized over a 1-0-year
period. Installments of principal and interest should be paid
first from cost recoveries and then, to the extent needed, from
trust fund revenues.
The new borrowing authority would be repaid from cost recoveries and,
through trust fund revenues, from contributors to the fund. Thus, this
new authority would leverage tax payments to meet current EPA spending
needs with the implied commitment of fund contributors to repay these
amounts over time.
The second preferred option would be to appropriate from general government
revenues an additional $350 million per year. The Task Group views the
added contribution from general revenues, like the tax on corporate gross
receipts, as a means to expand contributions to the fund from industry
and the public at large.
The third preferred option, but which is not endorsed by the Task Group,
would be to modify or to expand the present CERCLA taxes. Possible modification
could include:
o
Taxing benzene, toluene and xylene used in gasoline separately.
o
Increasing the per barrel tax on petroleum from the present O'.79
cents per barrel level.
o
Doubling the proposed tax on hazardous waste disposal.
o
Expanding the list of feedstocks subject to the CERCLA taxes to
include products named in recent legislation.
o
Increasing all CERCLA feedstock taxes to not more than 1.5 percent
of sales price.

It should be re-emphasized that the Task Group does not recommend anjr of
these tax increases at this time, but that they may be preferable to doubling
the existing CERCLA taxes.
Recommendation
That CMA endorse expanded EPA "safety valve" borrowing authority of up to
$350 million par year to finance Superfund site cleanup costs.

Economic Impact of CERCLA Funding Proposal — Waste End Tax
At its May 8, 1984 meeting, the CMA Executive committee was informed of the
existence of the Superfund Economic Impact Working Group which is examining
the impact which fees included in different proposals for Superfund re­
authorization would have on the chemical industry. A paper presented at
that meeting argued that the petrochemical sector would be the industry
sector most affected by an increase in CERCLA feedstock taxes and those
taxes would likely exceed the petrochemical industry's ability to pay
them.
The CMA Executive Committee has requested that the Superfund Economic
Impact Working Group consider the affect of the imposition of a $50 per ton
tax on the industry. Such an analysis has been conducted based on a survey
where some 60 CMA member companies reported on their total amount of waste
and its disposition.
The analysis used the amount of waste disposed of in 1982, as reported in
the aforementioned survey, and compared the $50 per ton fee with 1983 sales
and earnings. With one exception, waste end taxes would be less than 5 percent
of profits and less than 1.1 percent of sales.

SUFERFUMD ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY
DISCUSSION
An interim report of the Superfund Economic Impact Study Group was reviewed
for the Executive Committee on May 8. The report concentrated on the petro­
chemical feedstock tax which provides the largest portion of the Hazardous
Waste Trust Fund revenue and has the greatest amount of analytical data avail­
able in the public domain. The Executive Committee approved the summary paper
on the economic impact of increased feedstock taxes for use by association
representatives in Superfund reauthorization discussions with Congress.
Additionally, the group was directed to broaden the study to include the impact
of waste-end taxes which exceeded the $300 million/year of the CMA proposal and
to also include other revenue proposals currently before Congress.
Subsequent to this directive, H.R. S640 was introduced with a feedstock tax
and a waste-end tax on disposal as the principal funding vehicles. ' Rates were
four times greater than those proposed by CMA for the feedstock tax and at least
three times greater for some major disposal categories in the waste-end option.
It is therefore apparent that a CMA economic impact statement must consider
how CMA's feedstock and waste-end tax concepts are economically superior to
CERCLA TAXES
The CERCLA feedstock tax has been in effect for three years and IRS provides
data on collections quarterly which is analyzed by product and number of tax­
payers. It is possible to compare the taxes paid with information in the public
domain on production rates, sales revenue and profits for the industry sector.
Under CERCLA, the industry paid taxes on 11 primary petrochemicals of $155-165
million dollars annually. Although this tax revenue is about 20 percent below
legislatively projected collections, it amounted to 1.2 percent of sales revenue.
Collections could not be compared with profits, since those products showed a
net loss for 1982 and 1983 combined. H.R. 5640 would increase annual taxes to
more theui $600 million dollars and set the rate at more than 4 percent of sales.
CERCLA's post-closure tax is a waste-end tax which is somewhat comparable to
CMA's proposed waste-end tax. It differs in tax rate and covers fewer waste
disposal categories. It has been in effect only since the fourth quarter of
1983 and collection results are minimal. Nevertheless, when these collection
data are adjusted from CMA's higher proposed tax rates ($50/ST) and greater
coverage, it supports the potential for a waste-end tax revenue of $300 million
annually.
CMA's WASTE-END TAX PROPOSAL
In order to get a rough assessment of the impact of a waste-end tax on CMA
membership, waste disposal quantities on a dry weight basis of 60 member
company respondents out of 170 U.S. CMA member companies were compared on a
CMA 038171
confidential basis with sales revenues and earnings of those companies.
staff analyzed potential SSO/ST dry weight waste-end tax liability of
CMA member companies using 1982 waste disposal and 1983 chemical sales/profits.
with the CMA waste-end tax proposal as the tax vehicle, responding CMA
member company impacts on an annual basis would be the following:
j
CMA
o
Comparison with anticipated revenues—W* expected that 170
CMA member companies would pay $126 million of the $300 million
annual S50/ST dry weight tax; 60 members in the respondent
group would pay $85 million or 67 percent of anticipated taxes
for the entire CMA membership.
o
Concentration—Ten of 60 respondents would pay $76.3 million
of the $85 million total.
o
Economic impact—Of the top 10 taxpayers, two lost money in
1983, a third company would pay 59 percent of earnings, and the
remaining seven would pay 0.9 to 4.0 percent of earnings- None
of those taxpayers would pay more than 1.1 percent of sales.
Outside of the 10 top taxpayers, none of the remaining 50 would
be taxed in excess of 2.6 percent of earnings.
I
I
j
H.R. 5640 WASTE-END TAX
When data on industry averages are used, it appears that the waste-end tax
of H.R. 5640 could cost CMA members as much as 300 percent of CMA's
S50/ST proposal. Since H.R. 5640 would tax dilute streams with low solids
content on a liquid basis, rather than a dry weight basis,' the $5 to
$15/metric ton tax on the liquids basis could be as much as $75 to $150/ST
on a dry weight basis. Companies disposing of streams more dilute than
average would, of course, pay even higher rates and be penalized for water
added to make the waste disposal safer and improve operability.
JOBS/IMPORTS/EXPORTS/BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Two econometric models which we hoped to adapt to show the impact of higher
taxes on petrochemical investment, jobs, and balance of payments were found
to be not sufficiently sensitive or convertible on a timely basis for that
purpose. We are revising methodology to use an empirical approach to analysis
of past data to develop projections of economic impacts. The results will
likely rely on examples rather than completely quantitative results but will
demonstrate that excessive Superfund taxes will adversely affect jobs,
international competitiveness and balance of payments in petrochemicals.

EXHIBIT E
REPORT ON PUBLIC COMPENSATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
As requested by the Executive Committee, the Public Compensation
Task Group has continued to analyze various issues related to public
compensation. In this report the task group has defined advocacy
alternatives for waste site compensation that might be appropriate for
several possible outcomes of the study of the health effects associated
with waste sites being done by the Universities Associated for Research
and Education in Pathology (UAREP). The task group has also prepared a
brief summary on workplace disease compensation that includes advocacy
concepts still under review.
This report has three sections:
o
Section I, Status of Public Compensation Legislation, provides
a brief update of federal and state legislative initiatives in
public compensation.
o
Section II, Compensation for Waste Site Injuries, outlines
advocacy alternatives that might be appropriate for various
UAREP study scenarios.
o
Section III, Workplace Disease Compensation, Includes brief
background information on the subject, a description of other
advocacy groups activity in the issue, and a list of options
that the Task Group is still reviewing.
By way of an additional update, the UAREP study is on schedule and
under budget. UAREP has adopted management practices that enable the
study to stay on track.
The UAREP Executive Science Panel met on May 3 and 4 to assemble
the separate chapters of the study into an initial draft. This draft
was then reworked into a review draft at the end of May. Because the
terms of the contract guarantee UAREP*s complete Independence, CKA has
no knowledge of the draft's substantive content.
The Board of Sponsors has suggested that UAREP conduct a peer
review of the draft document before its release for general public
comment. A peer review would take 6 to 8 weeks, and would move the
document's public release to late July or early August. A work group of
company representative's and CMA staff are preparing a communications
program to discuss the UAREP study results.

STATUS OF PUBLIC COMPENSATION LEGISLATION
Rep. Florio's New Superfund Reauthorization Bill (H.R. 5640):
On May 9, 1984, Congressman Florio introduced a new "compromise"
Superfund bill. This staff product of Rep. Florio, Dingell and other
key members was prepared after the House Commerce Transportation and
Tourism Subcommittee voted 5-4 to reject the original Florio bill of
February 9, 1984 (H.R. 4813). Hearings on the bill have not been held,
but ve expect markup to take place on May 23. The bill will then begin
moving through the House for action this year because of compromises
made by key Congressional members and its broad-based sponsorship. The
bill does not create an administrative scheme or provide funding for
personal Injury claims. There are no shifting burdens of proof for
proving causation. The bill would create a new "federal cause of
action", however, allowing persons alleging Injury from waste sites to
bring a tort suit in federal court. Liability under the bill is strict,
joint, and several with provisions allowing courts to apportion damages
and defendants to show that responsibility for damages was divisible.
Despite the strict, joint and several liability provisions in the
bill, some Congressmen and advocacy groups are reluctant to support this
portion of the bill because the administrative fund concept has been
deleted. Politically, they believe the federal cause of action giving
victims Injured by waste site substances a viable federal avenue of
redress would weaken the case for an administrative fund. The bill
itself is a recent development and deserves further study.

Senate Hearings on Superfund Reauthorization; On May 16, 1984, Mr.
Edwin C. Holmer testified on behalf of CMA on various Superfund reauthorization issues. Including public compensation. CMA's testimony,
which paralleled comments made in the past, called for separating the
compensation issue from waste site cleanup and for obtaining more
scientific information on possible waste site disease relationships.
J
j
Although no companion bill to Mr. Florio's (H.R. 5640) has been
Introduced in the Senate, Sen. Stafford's Committee on Environment and
Public Works asked CMA to address public compensation issues similar to
those raised by Rep. Florio's. It's unclear whether the Senate will act
on a public compensation measure this term, although the prospects for
such action at this time remain unlikely. The Senate leadership,
legislative priorities and limited time remaining in this session make
it difficult for public compensation advocates in the Senate to act.
j
Massachusetts Study Commission on Waste Site Compensation; A study
commission established by the Massachusetts legislature has been holding
hearings on compensation for waste site injuries. The commission is
examining the adequacy of existing legal remedies in Massachusetts for .
these injuries, and the necessity for an administrative fund. The study
of health effects at the Woburn site is fueling the debate in this
state.
CMA 038174
Members of the task group and CMA staff have worked with the state
Industry representatives to brief them on CMA’s public compensation
activities and to help elicit testimony before the Commission from key
individuals. Hearings will end on June 30, a preliminary report
outlining Issues will be released in the early summer, and a final
report will be published by spring 1985. Dr. Bruce Karrh (DuPont) is
scheduled to testify before the hearings finish at the end of June.
New Jersey Victims' Compensation Bill;
Victim's compensation legislation was introduced in New Jersey
earlier this year which would establish an administrative compensation
fund, financed by Industry fees, which would also have the potential to
adversely Impact the tort system. Originally, hearings had bfen
expected to be held as early as March. However, committee activity is
now not expected to begin before June and possibly not until the summer
or early fall.
Despite the delays in moving the legislation, the potential for the
passage of onerous and precedent setting legislation remains high if the
sponsors decide to aggressively move the proposal. With this in mind.
State Affairs Committee members and CMA staff have been working closely
with the New Jersey Chemical Industry Council preparing for the
possibility of hearings and substantive discussions on the bill. New
Jersey CIC representatives have met privately with the sponsor to
determine his schedule and priorities with with respect to the bill.
Activity on both the federal and state fronts will continue to be
closely coordinated to the maximum possible extent to ensure consistency
In the chemical Industry's position.

II. COMPENSATION FOR WASTE SITE INJURIES
The UAREP study has proceeded under conditions which precluded
CMA's acquiring knowledge of Its direction or potential conclusion. To
minimize surprise, the Task Force has postulated four Scenarios and
discussed CMA'S possible actions In response to each. The Scenarios are
as follows:
o
Scenario I: A major national public health problem exists as a
result of exposure to hazardous waste sites. A substantial
population is at risk.
A substantial number of exposed
persons have manifested chronic disease of a type reasonably
related to the exposure. A substantial number of persons have
been exposed and have not as yet manifested a chronic disease
or Its symptoms (latency group) but realistically fear the
onset of chronic disease.
o
Scenario II: A minor public health problem exists as a result
of exposure to hazardous waste sites. A small population is
at risk. A limited number of persons have manifested chronic
disease of a type reasonably related to the exposure. A small
number of persons have been exposed and have not as yet
manifested chronic disease or its symptoms (latency group) but
realistically fear the onset of chronic disease.
o
Scenario III: The data generated by the study is incomplete,
equivocal or unverlflable so that no inferences may be drawn
concerning human health effects resulting from exposure to
hazardous waste sites.
o
Scenario IV: No public health problem exists as a result of
exposure to hazardous waste sites in any population nor will
any population in the future suffer adverse health consequences as a result of exposure to hazardous waste sites.
While CKA has no information from UAPEP on the study's conclusions,
the task group believes scenarios I and IV are unlikely, and that
scenarios II and III are most probable. Nevertheless, scenarios I and
IV were considered in order to be complete in preparing for the study's
release.
-sThe chart below summarizes how the various advocacy options that
the task group has considered might apply under the four UAREP
scenarios.

Public Health Surveillance at Waste Sites; Most of the
proposals related to victim's compensation have attempted to deal with
the issue in one of two ways: 1) establish a no-fault federal adminis­
trative fund to reimburse alleged victims; and 2} change existing tort
law to shift the burden of proof to a defendant and force him to prove a
negative. The Task Croup recognized that both of these changes were
attempts to deal with the problem of causation, or the relationship
between exposure to a hazardous substance and a disease. Causation has
been the central Issue of debate on victim's compensation.
CMA 038177
After two yeers of struggle with the causation issue* the task
group has been unable to develop any system that would change current
standards of scientific and legal proof, yet still be Intellectually
acceptable. Past experience with federal administrative funds clearly
illustrated the dangers of gradually increasing coverage, along with an
almost geometric growth in fund size. Changes In burden of proof does
violence to scientific notions of cause and effect. There is, moreover,
a real danger that such a change in the tort law will be carried over to
worker's compensation and product liability.
The task group agreed that a middle ground was needed. Our goal
was to develop a positive program chat would deal with public
perceptions of the hazardous waste exposure problem.
We recommend that CMA support a revision of Section 104(1)(4) and
(S) of CERCLA to provide for more site specific health studies and
medical monitoring at old hazardous waste sices. Our proposed changes
to the statute would give the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) new
authority to investigate health concerns around waste sites in
situations chat posed less than a public health emergency (only public
emergencies can now be investigated). CDC would be able to conduct
health status surveys and screening programs of people exposed to
hazardous substances.
Our approach treats the public- perception that old waste sices are
causing disease and illness as a public health problem rather than a
problem of how to deliver compensation under the current, or any
proposed legal system.
The objectives of our proposed changes to Section 104 are: provide
greater flexibility than now exists to utilize that section for medical
surveillance; limit the surveillance to individuals demonstrating actual
exposure from hazardous substances (as defined in CERCLA); and restrict­
ing application of tha section to site specific exposures from "old"
-> sites rather chan ambient exposures. The proposed statutory change
allows the Administrator (H.E.W.) discretion in developing the protocols
for such surveillance. It was the cask group's consensus that we would
be better advised not to put too much detail In the .statute, end Instead
work with the applicable agency on the proper protocol or scheme used to
carry out the statutory mandate.
Further, this approach allows us to build on the UAREF study.
Under any of the possible results of that work, the approach suggested
here could be used.
o
Insurance Coverage for People Exposed to Waste site Sub­
stances: In the event government health officials determine that people
adjacent to waste sites have been significantly exposed to hazardous
substances, the long-term health status of the exposed population would
be uncertain. To those who were exposed, the uncertainty of contracting
a chronic disease will likely persist in the form of fear and anxiety.
CMA 038178
The Task Croup is recommending adoption of private party insurance
policies for people exposed to hazardous waste substances. These would
be similar to the structured settlements of cort suits that some
companies have used to resolve environmental litigation cases. The task
group is not recommending legislative changes at this time, but is
studying further whether federal government involvement in this matter
would be appropriate.
The insurance policy would apply to people exposed to waste site
substances but who have not manifested disease. At the election of
responsible parties who are identified and connected with a waste
site,the exposed population would be offered a fully-paid insurance
policy. This policy would cover periodic medical testing and
examination for evidence of a designated chronic disease or diseases
likely to be caused by the exposure. These examinations would continue
for the life of the individual. If the disease develops, the policy
would pay all medical expenses, lost wages or earnings, burial expenses,
and a lump sum for anxiety and psychological trauma associated with the
disease. An Individual accepting the Insurance coverage would waive
his/her tort rights against the responsible party or parties providing
the insurance coverage.
The task group believes the private party insurance ^approach
affords companies several advantages Including reducing the fear compo­
nent accompanying the exposure. Two of these advantages are:
eliminating litigation costs, and obtaining epidemiology data to better
understand cause and effect relationships between exposure to waste sice
substances and chronic disease. It offers the exposed population the
obvious benefits of medical examinations and, if the designated disease
ensues, health care and money.
The utility of this option will depend on the extent to which
people have been exposed to waste site substances and, therefore, the
number of people who potentially would qualify for this insurance plan.
The task group plans to work with insurance representatives to determine
the costs of this option.
o
Administrative Fund: If it should become necessary to
establish a separate system to compensate people for chronic disease
caused by waste sites, the cask group recommends adoption of the
concepts and principles provided the Executive Committee in April 1983.
CMA would be prepared to argue chat the principles of eligibility,
damages, causation, exclusivity, funding, and delivery mechanism chat we
prepared last year should apply in any administrative fund that the
government tried to set up. The task group has modified the original
damages principle proposed to the Executive Committee in 1983. The
change involves capping any damages award to an eligible claimant and
offsetting it with money he received from employment or ocher
entitlement programs. Other than for damages, the waste compensation
principles proposed a year ago for an administrative fund remain Intact.
CMA 038179
-9Members of the task group believe an administrative fund for
hazardous waste compensation would be appropriate only under UAREP
Scenario I, where the study shoved a major national health problem
exists. Past experience with other government programs involving
industry - financed funds (e.g. the Black Lung Program), warrants
proceeding with an administrative fund only where other legal remedies
prove inadequate. Such a situation might exist where large numbers of
claimants injured by waste site substances would swamp the tort system
and other compensation alternatives. Until this occurred though, the
task group believes a federal administrative fund should be avoided.
o
Federal Cause of Action: In its simplest form, a federal cause
of action would give plaintiffs a right of access to federal courts to
pursue their tort claims for Injuries received from exposure to waste
site substances. Such a right exists today under federal statute for
many claimants. In modified form, a federal cause of action might be
accompanied by other elements affecting liability such as causation
presumptions, shifting burdens of proof, and strict standards of
liability. Once a federal cause of action became law, court
interpretation and Congressional tinkering could easily modify the
federal right as originally conceived by Congress and adversely affect
companies' liability.
For these reasons, the task group believes there are significant
risks in endorsing a federal cause of action provision in any
legislation. On the other hand, if our companies were forced to choose
among options such as a federal administrative fund, changes in burdens
of proof, or causation presumptions, the task group would prefer a
"clean" federal cause of action.

A federal cause of action might be appropriate under any of the
four UAREP scenarios, depending upon other legislative proposals. In
contrast to the recommended CERCLA Section 104(1) change, CMA would be
m-.ore hesitant to advocate adoption of a federal cause of action. Most
likely it would be a position to which CMA would retreat In the face of
other, more onerous legislative proposals.

CMA 038180
III.
WORKPLACE DISEASE COMPENSATION
Background
The workers' compensation laws of all 50 states provide broad
coverage for disability or death due to occupationally related disease.
The administrative system in place in the states are fairly efficient in
their operations and are designed to deliver prompt benefits at a low
transaction cost. Benefit funding mechanisms in use by self-insured
employers and Insurance carriers are reliable and reasonably efficient.
No state program has yet experienced unmanageable numbers of
occupational disease claims.
While the existing workplace benefit systems are sound, there has
been a growing perception that workplace disease victims are not treated
fairly under workers' compensation laws. Although state laws vary
considerably, criticisms of the existing system suggest (1) that benefit
amounts paid are coo low; (2) that arbitrary notice and filing
limitations operate to bar many otherwise valid claims; and (3) chat
proof of occupational causation is too difficult or costly to obtain.
Some or all of these views are shared by organized labor, some other
employee groups, some employers, some legislators, and some prominent
academicians.
From an employer's or manufacturer's perspective, it is clear that
workplace disease claims are, with increasing frequency, finding their
way into the tort system. In the case of a workplace exposure to a
known or suspected toxic substance, a tort theory of recovery may be
sustained against a manufacturer of the substance, or in some instances,
against the employer Itself, on the basis of traditional products
liability concepts or various creative theories which seek to avoid the
exclusive remedy protections in state workers' compensation laws.
Resorting to the tort system, with its potential for much higher awards,
higher attorneys' fees, and sympathetic jury verdicts, appears to be a
course that is pursued with Increasing frequency.
Reform Activities
Dissatisfaction with the existing workers' compensation systems of
the states coupled vlth the asbestos disease litigation crisis which has
materialized has genarated considerable activity in the past year. The
most prominent of these efforts are as follows:
o
In 1982 and again in 1983 Congressman George Miller (D.
Calif.) introduced legislation to create a federally administered
occupational disease compensation program funded by employers, and
to some extent by product manufacturers. This legislation, which
focused on asbestos and radon daughters, but could easily be
expanded to other substances, is now dormant but is not abandoned.
o
In June 1983 the Crum and Forster Insurance Company Issued a
set of comprehensive proposals to reform state workers'
compensation programs.
CMA 038181
o
The Insurant* Industry trade associations together with state
workers' compensation program administrators are now involved In an
effort to propose comprehensive system reform.
o
The AFL-CtO (Industrial Union Department) has assumed an
active role in pursuing broad-based reforms and favors a
federalized benefit system and continued access to the tort system.
o
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has announced its support for
reform of state workers' compensation systems.
o
The Business Round Table Is commissioning studies of workplace
disease reform funding and mechanisms for determining occupational
causation of disease.
o
A number of asbestos manufacturers have drafted legislation to
create a supplemental federally administered compensation program
for asbestos disease victims. The proposal has no congressional
sponsorship at this time.
o
The Kasten Bill (S.44) which would establish mandatory federal
standards for product liability suits proposes to integrate
workers' compensation and tort remedies.
CMA's Public Compensation Task Group has monitored all of these
activities and had undertaken an independent investigation of the
matters at issue from the prospective of the chemical manufacturing
industry. It appears that there are substantial Industry Interests at
stake and that those interests are focused primarily on tha increasing
spillover of workplace disease claims into the tort system. A better
integration of tha two systems and more rational mathods for
distributing workplace disease liabilities are objectives which merit
the careful attention of the industry. The obligation to promote the
equitable compensation of chemical Industry workers afflicted by
occupational disease, and the prevention of disease are also identified
as areas of substantial interest.
However, these aspects of the universe of workpiece disease
concerns cannot be addressed apart from the Interests of other involved
groups. In addressing the larger context the Committee has identified
15 general target principles to aid in the evaluation of tvolving
workers' compensation reform proposals.
Target Principles And Objectives For Workers* Compensation Reform
V
Prevention;
If occupational disease compensation reform
proceeds, the reforms agreed upon should actively promote disease
prevention and involve employers and employees in prevention
initiatives.
Federalization;
The creation of a new federal occupational
disease compensation system is not warranted.
Delivery System;
Occupational disease victims should be
equitably compensated within existing state workers' compensation
systems.
Exclusive Remedy;
Workers' compensation must be the exclusive
remedy for disability or death caused by workplace disease. A
workers' compensation claim must be pursued prior to any effort to
seek tort recovery against a third party and that recovery should
be reduced by the current value of worker’s compensation benefits
including medical care benefits. Employers' subrogation rights and
third-party rights - to contribution or indemnity should be
abolished. Workers' compensation reform should be consistent and
integrated with product liability reforms endorsed by the chemical
industry. It is appropriate to explore proposed mechanisms to
eliminate tort suits altogether in workplace disease claims through
manufacturer participation in workers' compensation benefit
programs.
Eligibility;
Disability or death attributable to an occupational
disease should be compensated but eligibility decisions must be
based upon established and uniform scientific standards with
sufficient flexibility Co encompass the extraordinary case.
Causation;
Occupational causation should be determined by
occupational disease experts using established, uniform scientific
criteria davalopcd by scientists in light of the best information
available. Presumptions and similar arbitrary legal devices are
incompatible with evolving science-based standards and are
inappropriate.
Multiple Causation: A disease traced to multiple causes is not
compensated unless its occupational origins are medically
significant.
Statute Of Limitations; A claim should be filed within one year
from the date of actual or imputed discovery that an occupational
disease has been manifested or within one year from death due to an
occupational disease.
Notice, And Definitional Limitations;
Arbitrary notice of claim
requirements and unscientific or unfair definitional limitations
which preclude recovery in occupational disease claims should be
repealed.
Disability/Death:
An employer should be liable for disability
compensation only to the extent that the disability is caused by
occupational factors; death benefits are appropriate only if death
was significantly related to or materially caused by occupational
disease. Disability and death inquiries are properly made by
medical experts.
Benefits: Cash benefits paid should be computed in light of actual
wages lost, subject to statutory maxima and minima. In latent
disease cases, benefits should not be unreasonably low solely
because the last exposure occurred years earlier. Medical care
should be available without arbitrary restriction.
Retirees: Disease compensation benefits are properly reduced only
by Social Security old age benefits.
Liability:
Disease compensation benefits are properly paid by
the last employer exposing the worker to a hazardous substance or
condition.
Funding: Benefits liabilities must be insurable through existing
workers' compensation Insurance mechanisms.
Retroactivity: Occupational disease compensation system reforms
should be prospective. However, any retroactive application of
reforms must carry back exclusive remedy protections if benefit
obligations are extended to cover past incidences of disease.
Alternatives And Options Under Review
At this time there is no apparent need to support or propose
substantial changes in the occupational disease compensation
systems of the states. Current recommended options are:
a
o
Take no action to change existing systems;
o
Support modest state system reforms in statutes of
limitations, medical causation, etc.
o
Continue to monitor ongoing efforts pursued by others; develop
and refine CMA positions and alternatives.
o
Oppose federal involvement in occupational disease reform.
If more extensive occupational disease reform proposals gain
momentum, and there is a likelihood chat some will in the next year
or so, the development and consideration of creative alternatives
may be essential to a realization of chemical industry objectives.
A number of promising alternatives and options have surfaced within
the Committee and are the subject of continuing discussion. These,
include:
CMA 038184
1
o
A proposal to combine a disease prevention and health
surveillance system with traditional state workers'
compensation programs through a scries of economic incentives
and disincentives which are designed to encourage employer and
employee participation in disease prevention initiatives, to
reward employee participation with increased benefits, and to
Justify employer participation with improved protections from
tort suit. Other benefits which might accrue in this approach
include lover transaction costs, better medical records
compiled by employer-selected medical specialists for use If
disease occurs, and an Increased likelihood of early
detection, prompt treatment, and a return of the worker to
gainful employment.
o
Proposals which may facilitate the integration of all workers'
compensation and tort liabilities which may arise out of
occupational exposures to hazardous substances, with a view
toward limiting chemical manufacturing Industry liabilities
arising from workplace disease.
o
Proposals to seek federal health agency participation in the
development of medical standards for use in claims.
ACTION:
o
Approve the recommendation to amend CERCtA Section 104(i) to
provide for more site specific health studies and medical
monitoring.
o
Review other options for waste site compensation and
principles for workplace disease compensation.

REPORT OF THE TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
The Technical Director's report highlights CMA accomplishments and
activities in its advocacy of prime issues.
COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF CHEMICALS
e
TSCA REGULATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) — The Office of Toxic
Substances (OTS) is developing a proposed rule that will impose
requirements on research and development activities for commercial
chemicals. OTS is proposing the rule to implement TSCA Section 5(h)(3) and
complete the final rule for premanufacture notification (PMN). The
proposed rule will include provisions for recordkeeping, hazard analysis,
and risk notification of R&D chemicals. The Chemical Regulations Advisory
Committee (CRAC) is working with OTS staff to ensure that the requirements
of this rule do not have an adverse Impact on innovation. OTS expects to
publish the proposed rule in the fall of this year.
e
IMPORT CERTIFICATION FOR R&D SHIPMENTS — CRAC has developed a proposal for
EPA to create a special provision for shipments of R&D chemicals subject to
the TSCA Section 13 Import certification rule. The Section 13 rule
requires that importers of chemical shipments certify either that the
shipment is not subject to TSCA or that the shipment is in compliance with
TSCA and all rules or orders under TSCA. For many shipments of R&D
substances, the certification of TSCA compliance Is not possible because
the identity of the substance is unknown and, in fact, the substance is
being Imported for analysis and identification. Even where the identity of
the substance is known, the Import certification rule imposes burdensome
requirements on the thousands of shipments Imported for R&D purposes. The
CRAC proposal emphasizes that R&D chemicals are used under the supervision
of individuals that are trained in safe handling procedures which minimize
the risk from exposure.
t
STATEMENT ON NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (NRC) STUDY — On May 7, CRAC
submitted a statement to the Senate Subcommittee on Toxic Substances and
Environmental Oversight, The statement presented CMA's view of the NRC
report Toxicity Testing: Strategies to Determine Needs and Priorities,
which was the subject of an April 10 Senate hearing. The statement
emphasized that the design of the NRC study limits the conclusions that can
be drawn from the study. In particular, the statement points out that the
NRC study did not Include many ongoing or recently completed testing
activities, such as those at CUT, in response to TSCA Section 4, or the
testing that individual companies sponsor. The Senate may use the NRC
study to justify the testing of all new chemicals.
e
ADMINISTRATOR'S TOXIC SUBSTANCES ADVISORY COMMITTEE (ATSAC) — On May 9,
CRAC submitted a statement to ATSAC on confidential business information
(CBI). The statement responds to 11 questions on CBI presented to ATSAC by
Dr. John Moore, Assistant Administrator for Pesticides and Toxic
Substances. Dr. Moore is seeking ATSAC's advice on confidentiality issues'
so that he can consider changes to the procedures used for handling
confidential business information submitted under TSCA.

CRAC's Risk Analysis Task Group is planning a symposium on error
propagation in risk analysis. The symposium will identify the. specific
nature of the problem of using overly conservative assumptions and suggest
ways of using more realistic methods.
CRAC's Impact Analysis Task Croup is writing a paper on the chemical
industry’s activities to reduce risk. The paper will be based on an
industry survey completed last year, and will identify for the public what
the Industry has been doing to reduce risks to health, safety, and the
environment.

BIOMEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIAL PROGRAMS
BUTADIENE - The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated regulatory
action on 1,3-butadiene under Section 6 of TSCA. The Agency detprmined
that the chemical may present an unreasonable risk. EPA is seeking
information to determine appropriate control measures. Five areas have
been designated in which information is being sought; I) health effects;
2) manufacturing, processing, use and disposal; 3) human exposures; 4)
appropriate controls and their costs; and, 5) substitutes.
CRESOLS - EPA has proposed that the cresols industry test various cresols
for potential health effects. Cresols manufacturers asked CMA to sec up a
program on these chemicals. Accordingly, the Special Programs Division
convened an exploratory meeting and approved a tentative budget to cover
the initiation phase of the program.
The Program Panel will work with EPA to develop a reasonable and sufficient
testing program. The Panel Intends to evaluate the Agency's proposed
testing requirements in conjunction with additional data in order to
develop a reasonable testing program.
ETHYLENE DICHLORIDE (EDC) - On April 23, 1984, EPA published its draft
Health Assessment Document on EDC. The Panel has hired an outside
consultant to prepare comments on EPA's draft Document. The comments will
be filed by June 22, 1984.
ETHYLENE OXIDE CEO) - EPA released an external review draft of a Hazard
Assessment Document on EO on April 23, 1984. Comments are to be submitted
by June 22 and EPA Science Advisory Board hearings are tentatively
scheduled for August. The Ethylene Oxide Industrial Council (EOIC)
Scientific Committee will develop comments and plans to form a Science
Panel consisting of EOIC members and consultants for the hearing.

NAPHTHENATE METAL SOAPS - The Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) in May
1983, recommended chac EPA consider requiring manufaccurers and processors
of calcium, cobale, and lead naphehenaCes to conduce chemical face, health
effects, and environmental effects testing on those three chemicals under
the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The CMA Naphthenate Metal Soaps
Program Panel and Shell Oil Company provided production, use, exposure and
health effects information to EPA and concluded that, in view of ongoing
research on chose chemicals, no additional testing is necessary. On May
11, 1984, EPA agreed with the industry position and signed a Federal
Register notice stating that it will not initiate rulemaking under Section
NICKEL-CONTAININC CATALYSTS - Manufacturers of nickel-containing catalysts
asked CMA to establish an advocacy program to respond to potential
regulatory activities within various government agencies. Accordingly, the
Special Programs Division convened an exploratory meeting which resulted in
a decision to form a Panel. A proposed one-year budget was approved.
The Panel will represent the Interests of nickel-containing catalysts
producers, adopting and conveying advocacy positions, as appropriate. To
support its positions, the Panel will collect information necessary to
assess safety, environmental and health issues.
POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (iPCB) - The PCB Panel submitted comments in
response to EPA's Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the risks posed
from fires involving electrical transformers containing PCBs.
TITANIUM DIOXIDE - The CMA Titanium Dioxide Program Panel met with the
National Cancer Institute ()JCI) on April 13, 1984, to discuss NCI plans to
conduct an epidemiology study of titanium dioxide workers. NCI does not
plan to undertake any study on the chemical but is merely gathering
Information on various chemicals to develop its priorities for future
projects. The Panel will continue to monitor activities of government
agencies and other research organizations Interested in epidemiologic or
toxicologic studies.
VINYLIDENE CHLORIDE (VDC) - On January 9, 1984, the Vinylldene Chloride
Program Panel filed written comments with EPA on the Agency's draft Health
Assessment Document on VDC, The written comments were followed by oral
presentation to the Science Advisory Board (SAB) on April 27, 1984. In
addition to recognizing industry's concerns, SAB has raised its own issues
and has asked EPA to respond to various scientific issues in the next draft
document.
EFFECTIVE WASTE HANDLING AND DISPOSAL
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE IN
CONNECTION WITH THE CARRIAGE OF CERTAIN SUBSTANCES BY SEA — A CMA
representative vas a business advisor to the United States Delegation to an
International Maritime Organization Diplomatic Conference that opened on
April 30, 1984. The Conference addressed revisions to the International
Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (1969); the

f
I
Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage (1971); and a proposed nsv
Intsrnational Convsntion on Liability and Compansation in Connection with
the Carriage of Noxious and Hazardous Substances by Sea.
PHASE II RCRA IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS LITIGATION SETTLEMENT -- The
Environmental Management Committee (EMC) at its April 18, 1984, meeting
voted to authorize CMA entering into a proposed settlement agreement to
resolve AISI v. EPA. All the regulations have been satisfactorily resolved
or mooted.
EMC ANNUAL PLANNING SESSION — At its annual planning session on April 17,
1984, the Environmental Management Committee (EMC) covered a wide spectrum
of environmental Issues. Specific attention was provided to the
groundwater issue and the need to develop a comprehensive CMA strategy, and
to environmental data relevancy for all media (i.e., sampling, analytical,
interpretation, etc.).
CMA AD HOC GROUNDWATER STRATEGY GROUP — Under the auspices of the
Environmental Management Committee, an ad hoc groundwater strategy group
was organized to develop a comprehensive CMA strategy for addressing
groundwater Issues. Meetings were held on May 4 and May 17, 1984, with
staff and member company representatives of EMC, its Cask groups, GRC, SAC
and CRAC's Risk Assessment Task Group.
GROUNDWATER ANALYSIS — The EMC has approved a project that is designed to
provide more definitive evidence to EPA that the agency's existing
groundwater sampling/analysis methodologies (i.e., SW-846) are
scientifically Inappropriate for purposes of determining compliance.
HAZARDOUS WASTE TRACKING PROGRAM — CMA's hazardous waste tracking program
is operational with supplemental data continuing to be entered into the
system. The program has been expanded to handle data on groundwater,
drinking water, and monitoring-well information.
EPA SUPERFUND GUIDANCE PEER REVIEW — The EMC's Hazardous Waste Response
Task Group is conducting a peer review of two EPA Superfund guidance
documents — (1) Guidance on Remedial Investigations; and (2) Fates and
Effects Modeling at Superfund Sites.
EMC SEMIANNUAL ENVIRONMENTAL UPDATE -- The Environmental Management
Committee conducted its semi-annual Environmental Update on May 22-23,
1984, in Washington, D.C. The one and one-half day program, attended by
approximately 130 persona. Included comprehensive discussions on all
environmental issues and how they Impact on chemical industry operations.
The luncheon speaker was F. Henry Habicht, II, Assistant Attorney General
for Land and Natural Resources. He addressed general environmental Issues
and offered soma candid observations on enforcement at the Federal and
state level.
INCIDENTAL CHEMICAL EXPOSURE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
The Chemical Manufacturers Association and the Environmental Defense Fund
will jointly sponsor a symposium on the Health Effects of Industrial Waste
Sites at the AAAS annual meeting. The symposium will identify what is

known and vhac la not known about this controversial subject, and will
suggest scientific ways to fill data gaps.
The Universities Associated for Research and Education in Pathology (UAREP)
study of health effects associated with waste sites is on schedule. UAREP
is considering having the draft study "peer-reviewed" prior to its release
for public comment. Such a review would move the release date to early
August.
CLEAN WATER
EPA PRETREATMENT IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW TASK FORCE — CMA representatives
met with EPA on May 30. 1984. to discuss EPA's pretreatment program. The
group discussed: interim recommendations by EPA's Pretreatmenc
Implementation Review Task Force, removal credits workability, and general
policies and longer range pretreatmenc programs.
GAO DATA CONCERNING NPDES PERMITS N0NC0MPLIANCE — On April 19, 1984, CMA
requested from the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) Information and
data concerning the organic chemicals category of the GAO report entitled
"Wastewater Dischargers Are Not Complying With EPA Pollution Control
Permits”. Data on the frequency of noncompliance and the criteria with
which compliance was determined are specific concerns.
NATIONAL PRETREATMENT REMOVAL CREDITS AMENDMENTS — The Environmental
Management Committee's Water Policy Task Group has prepared a national
pretreatment removal credits amendment. These materials are designed for
use by Government Relations in its advocacy on the Clean Water Act.
CLEAN AIR
FUGITIVE EMISSIONS/FLARES LITIGATION SETTLEMENT — The Environmental
Management Committee at its April 18, 1984. meeting voted to authorize CMA
entering into a proposed settlement agreement to resolve CMA's challenge of
EPA's new source performance standard for fugitive emission leaks and the
use of flare technology to control emissions.
EPA HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANT STRATEGY — The Environmental Management
Committee's Process Emission Regulations Task Group is working with EPA's
Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards in its reevaluation of a
national strategy for regulating hazardous air pollutants.
OCCUPATIONAL. SAFETY AND HEALTH
CMA congratulated OSKA on Improvements in their second draft of a proposed
standard for confined space entry. Nevertheless, we suggested technical
changes in the latest draft. These dealt with definitions of "entry",
"hazardous atmosphere", "inerting", "solo entry", and other terms. We also
commented on the proposed requirement for listing, on the permit, names of
all who enter a confined space, reliance on outside help rather than
in-house rescue teams, and ocher aspects of the proposal.
The first symposium of a series an "Hazards Communication: Training and
Educating the Worker", held in Houston on April 24, was well received. In
response to a suggestion from the audience, the program for future symposia
CMA 038190

in this series was ravisad to placa mora amphasis on the OSHA Hazards
Communication Rule's training requirements. The next symposium will be in
Philadelphia. June 14, and the last one in San Francisco, September 25.
SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE CHEMICAL PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTION
e
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REGULATIONS - INCIDENT REPORTS — An initial position
was prepared and mailed to Industry representatives for their
consideration. Industry interest in this docket has been very low even
Chough elimination of excess reporting requirements could improve public
reaction to hazardous material transportation safety.
The DOT/MTB hearing regarding the use of Emergency Response Cuidebooks and
Material Safety Data Sheets during transportation generated great interest
in both the carrier and shipper industries. All carriers and shippers who
testified at the May 2 hearing opposed reliance on MSDSs during
transportation. Comments are due by June 26, 1984.
e
TANK CAR COMPENSATION — The American Petroleum Institute (API) presented
their compromise solution on tank car compensation to the Joint Negotiating
Committee over CMA's objections. The API proposal reduces by perhaps $50
million, the compensation that car providers receive from the railroads.
The reduction in car compensation would be, primarily, a reduction in
compensation to CMA member companies. Our Car Compensation Subcommittee
met with representatives of API on May 23, 1984, to attempt to resolve our
differences and improve our negotiating position.
OCEAN TRANSPORTATION — CMA is working with the Ocean and International
Task Group to prepare comments on several rules proposed by the Federal
Maritime Commission (FMC) to implement the new shipping act. The subjects
CMA will address Include service contracts, time/volume rates. Independent
action, loyalty contracts, and processing of agreements.
On May 9, 1984, CMA filed comments with the FMC supporting its proposal to
prohibit Philippine flag vessels from entering U.S. ports. This is a means
of retaliation to the Philippine cargo reservation which has caused member
companies to shift 50-73X of their cargo from their preferred third flag
carriers and to endure administrative burdens and service delays.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE — Members of the CHEMTREC/Distribution staff visited
with the Canadian Chemical Producers' Association and the Transport Canada
officials to learn more about the TEAP and CANUTEC operations. He also
discussed and obtained general agreement that extension of the CHEMTREC 800
service in Canada would be beneficial to both countries.
The Emergency Response Work Group is continuing its meeting with
associations representing emergency response organizations. The objective
of these meetings is to learn what kinds of training and technical
assistance can best be provided by the chemical Industry to the first
responder at a hazardous material incident.

ENERGY AND FEEDSTOCK ISSUES
NATURAL CAS POLICY — An Energy and Feedstock Issues Briefing was
held May 10 ac CMA. Congressman Jack R. Fields (R-TX) discussed the
uncertain prospects for H.R. 4277 voted out of che House Committee on
Energy and Commerce. The CMA Energy Committee recommended urging the House
Rules Committee to oppose granting a rule on H.R. 4277. We believe it is
an unsatisfactory vehicle for Natural Gas Policy Act amendments.
Commissioner Oliver G. Richard, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC), also discussed Che priorities and efforts to enhance competition in
natural gas markets. He stressed che Importance of addressing potential
regulatory impact on residential and commercial consumers.
CMA submitted written comments to the U.S. Department of Energy in response
to their public inquiry in connection with a report to Congress on the
Status of Natural Gas Markets. CMA restated advocacy for deregulation of
all wellhead ceiling prices by a date certain, removal of gas market
restrictions, and che need for more efficacious contract carriage programs
with equal access for all consumers to all categories of gas. CMA also
believes that there is minimal potential for a price fly-up in 1983 with
partial deregulation of natural gas under current law.
e
NEW ENERGY INFORMATION AGENCY DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS -- CMA Joined an Ad
Hoc Task Force of the Business Advisory Council on Federal Reports to
oppose a new data collection proposal initiation by the Energy Information
Administration (EIA). Other Task Force members Include: The Aluminum
Association of America, che American Iron and Steel Institute, the American
Paper Institute, the American Petroleum Institute, the American Textile
Manufacturers Institute, the Council of Industrial Boiler Owners, the
Industrial Oil Consumers Group, the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Society of the
Plastics Industry, and che Chamber of Commerce of the United States. Last
month CMA submitted comments to the EIA and Office of Management Budget.
CMA APPEALS ASHRAE 100.4P STANDARD — On June 16, 1984, CMA will
participate in a meeting of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating
and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) to appeal implementation of their
100.4P proposed energy conservation standard for existing Industrial
building. We believe the standard would be adopted by certain states and
other regulatory bodies as mandatory requirements for industry. Required
energy audits, engineering studies, and building conservation measures
could be costly. CMA will continue to urge that the ASHRAE 100.4P be
Issued as a voluntary technical guide so that chemical Industry management
will not have resources diverted arbitrarily from the most cost-effective
opportunities.

CMA MEMBERS EXCEED 1985 CONSERVATION TARGET — The preliminary 1983 CMA
energy conservation survey results indicate that on average, chemical

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS
JON C. HOLTZMAN
With the active participation of CMA’s officers and a number of board
members the Superfund communication program, initiated two months ago, has
moved into high gear. That effort will continue over the next several months
as we expand our network of contacts to include regional media.
The contacts produce discussions that are not limited to the Superfund
issue but bring in Clean Sites, Inc., general industry attitudes of cooperation
to solve problems. For the most part we are finding understanding of — and
agreement with — many of the points we raise.
A number of editors and reporters have expressed appreciation at our
willingness to talk and to answer questions. The payback for the effort is
beginning to come in more balanced reporting. But there is still a long way
NEW RESOURCES; Six members of member company staffs with special expertise
in Superfund issues have been recruited to either accompany board members or
directly handle contacts with regional news media. All have received special
training on the Superfund message. Assisting will be: David Baird, Exxon;
Gene Berman, Dupont; Tom Heilman, Allied; Lee Nute, Dow; Mike Pierle, Monsanto;
and Julie VanEgmond, Cyanamid.

REGIONAL COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM:
The raw data has come in from the survey of the media made after the
Louisiana Chemical Association made its series of mini media tours in late
1983. The data compared attitudes surveyed about a year earlier. The
results are impressive.
e
40 percent of the mpdia found the relationship between the chemical
industry and the media was "excellent" or "good" in 1984, compared
to 23 percent in 1983.
e
80 percent rated the industry "excellent" or "good" at providing
useful background information in 1984, compared to 54 percent in 1983.
e
77 percent rated the industry "excellent" or "good" at providing
comprehensive information in 1984, compared to 19 percent in 1983.
e
71 percent rated the industry "excellent" or "good" at providing
accurate information in 1984, compared to 55 percent in 1983.
The media also rated the industry significantly higher in their percep­
tions of the industry as providing a safe work environment, being safe to live
near and controlling pollution.
A sobering fact: the second survey, conducted a year later, found that
25 percent of the reporters and editors originally surveyed had moved on to
different assignments or jobs.
GENERAL COMMUNICATIONS: "Yellow Pages" section of the Issue Briefing
Book is in the hands of CMA executive contacts and key industry government
relations, communications, and management personnel. The Issue Book is updated
on a quarterly basis unless there is a rapidly changing issue which demands
more frequent revision. Distribution has grown to 1200 and many members
reproduce and distribute the material internally!
The Communications Committee conducted a two day planning conference
May 2 and 3 to evaluate current programming and identify future courses of
action. Special attention was devoted to groundwater, chemophobia, balan­
cing press reporting and issues which might follow hazardous waste management
as media focus of attention.
Videotape featuring three CMA issue-oriented films has been copied by
228 schools, becoming a permanent part of their library. Projection: more
than 500 duplications by July 31.

REPORT OP THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
WILLIAM M. STOVER
NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIESi
KEY CHEMICAL TAX ISSUES IN DEFICIT REDUCTION
TAX CONFERENCE
Following the Easter Congressional recess, the Senate attempted to
complete the expenditure reduction provisions of H.R. 2163, the Federal
Boat Safety Act and the focus for the Senate's deficit reduction budget
package. A House-Senate conference on the tax provisions in H.R. 2163 and
those in H.R. 4170, the omnibus tax legislation which passed the House
earlier this year, should begin by mid to late May.
The Senate amendment to H.R. 2163 contains several key provisions that
are of great importance to the chemical industry:
o
the Administration's Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) provisions to
provide a GATT-legal alternative to replace the Domestic Inter­
national Sales Corporation (DISC) provision of the Internal Revenue
Code;
o
a two-year extension of the moratorium on Treasury Regulations
1.861-8 that would require allocation of overseas research and
development expenses to foreign source income;
o
provisions to modify and to make permanent the research and
experimentation tax credit.
Although these provisions would be of greatest benefit to the chemical
industry, there are other important provisions in this legislation. For
example, both the House and Senate bills would impose much tighter control
over premature accruals. The Senate bill clarifies the "all events" test
in present law and would provide generally that no deduction for Federal
income tax purposes would be allowed until "economic performance" occurs.
The Senate bill also contains an election to allow a less restrictive
method in the case of the reclamation and closing costs of mines and in the
disposal of liquid and hazardous wastes from disposal sites (other than
Superfund sites). This provision could be of crucial importance to the
chemical industry.
The total fiscal impact of this legislation on the chemical industry
is difficult to project. However, the value of the provisions for the
Foreign Sales Corporations, the extended moratorium on the $861 regulations
for allocating versus research and development expenses to foreign income,
and to modify and to make permanent the research and experimentation tax
credit are estimated to exceed $3 billion. Because of the many provisions
in this important legislation that would affect corporate activities, CMA
advised representatives of member companies to review this legislation
carefully and to contact House and Senate conferees about their concerns.
CMA is working closely with allied trade associations and business
groups to urge the House-Senate conferees to retain the provisions in the
Senate bill to establish the Foreign Sales Corporation and to extend the
moratorium on the $861 research and development allocation regulations.
CMA 038197
NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIES:
PATENT TERM RESTORATION
For almost three and a half years, CMA has participated in a
Washington business coalition under the leadership of the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association (PMA) to support passage of the Patent Term
Restoration Act. This important legislation would extend patent life on
products that must undergo prolonged periods of government-mandated testing
and review. The organized opposition to this legislation has focused on
the impact the legislation would have on the generic drug industry.
To resolve this opposition and impasse, PMA earlier this year proposed
a two-title bill that would contain both patent term restoration and
abbreviated new drug provisions (that would enable generic drug
manufacturers to enter the market more easily than under the present
system). PMA reached an agreement in principle on this proposal with
Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA). As of May 14, PMA and Congressman
Waxman's staff were unable to reduce this agreement in principle to
acceptable legislative language.
On April 26, Representatives Glickman (D-KS) and DeWine (R-OH)
introduced H.R. 5529, the Agricultural Patent Reform Act. This legis­
lation would provide patent restoration for pesticides, animal drugs, and
chemicals subject to premanufacture notification under TSCA. On May 3, CMA
notified PMA that is was endorsing H.R. 5529. A hearing is expected in mid
to late May before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Civil
Liberties and the Administration of Justice. A witness will testify on
behalf of CMA, NACA and the Animal Health Institute.
CMA will continue to work in the business coalition effort to enact
patent term restoration legislation. CMA will cooperate with NACA to
support passage of H.R. 5529, and, in addition, will cooperate with PMA to
support a more inclusive bill if acceptable compromise language can be
worked out in this session.

NATURAL GAS LEGISLATION
The House Energy and Commerce Committee reported on April 12 a natural
gas bill (H.R. 4277) designed to put a cap on natural gas prices until 1987
and allow pipelines to escape from contractual obligations.
Major provisions include a freeze on above market prices until January
1, 1985, forced renegotiation of certain high-priced gas and a two-year
ceiling on indefinite price escalators in gas contracts unless the
contracts are renegotiated. Take-or-pay obligations are limited to fifty
percent of contracted volumes, minimum bills between pipelines and
distributors are eliminated and a prudency standard for pipelines
purchasing gas is established. H.R. 4277 was sponsored by Representatives
(R-IL-15), and Thomas J. Tauke (R-IA-2) and represents a dramatic
turnaround from the earlier subcommittee reported version.
The objective of the 22 members supporting H.R. 4277 was to report a
bill quickly without amendments. Commitments were obtained by the Chairman
to support the package and all amendments were defeated. Proponents of
CMA 038198
decontrol and producing-state Democrats have labeled the bill a
“pipeline-bailout" and have pointed to the regional economic disparities
the legislation would create. The bill is similar in many respects to
earlier American Gas Association and Citizens Labor Energy Coalition (CL£C)
supported versions.
With the bill being reported without amendment, commitments may not
hold and considerable debate could occur in the Rules Committee and on the
House floor. Chairman Dingell may not be committed to the bill as drafted,
but he has termed the prospects reasonable for getting a vote from the
House on the bill in July. The House Energy Committee report has not been
filed and a rule has not yet been requested.
The Rules Committee could report the bill in such a way that permits
all sides in the controversy an opportunity for amendments or substitute
versions. The House Majority Leader does not support the bill ‘as drafted
with its recontrol aspects. On the other hand, the Speaker of the House
has indicated some support for an even more restrictive version.
CMA, together with other user trade associations, is strongly opposed
to H.R. 4277 and every effort will be made to prevent passage of the
punitive legislation in its present form. CMA has stated the status quo is
preferable to the Sharp bill and opposes a rule sending that bill to the
House floor.
Producers are even more adamant in their opposition and have indicated
that H.R. 4277 cannot be amended to lessen the negative impact of price
caps and freezes. The Administration has also registered its opposition
and predicted that if the bill were enacted, new gas production would be
discouraged and a serious gas shortage could be created once the current
glut is used up. Energy Secretary Donald P. Hodel, together with
Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is expected
to seek changes in the legislation.
Activity in the House is being closely watched by a coalition of
Senators who are trying to develop a compromise bill. Senate Energy
Committee Chairman James A. McClure (R-ID) is working to continue the
negotiating process. The House reported bill runs counter to many of the
principles supported by the Senate leadership and the recent proposal under
discussion, but passage of a House bill could return natural gas
legislation to the Senate floor. A series of "quick-fix" natural gas
amendments to unrelated legislation may be attempted in the Senate.
Proponents of deregulation could also filibuster any effort to pass a bill
similar to the present House version.
NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIESt
TRADE REMEDIES LEGISLATION
The House Ways and Means Committee reported out the Trade Remedies
Reform Act of 1984 (a.k.a. the Gibbons bill) in early April. It is
expected that the bill will be considered on the House floor under a
modified rule which allows only Committee approved amendments. The bill,
as reported, was essentially the same as the subcommittee version with the
only substantive change being the deletion of the section dealing with
non-market economy imports. The Senate Finance Committe has held hearings
CMA 038199
T
1
on a bill to address this issue, but no markup is currently scheduled.
The most controversial section of the Gibbons bill establishes the
authority to impose countervailing duties against imported material
manufactured from raw materials priced below export or fair market values.
This same section of the bill establishes a mechanism to deal with industry
targeting by foreign governments and provides a remedy for downstream
dumping.
The Administration is opposed to these provisions and attempted
unsuccessfully to strike them at the committee markup. CMA member
companies continue to hold very strong opinions on both sides of the issue
causing the CMA Executive Committee to take no position on the Gibbons
bill.
While no floor action is currently planned on the Gibbons bill in the
House, it is likely that the bill will come to the floor for action in June
and will pass the House. A Senate counterpart still does not exist. If
the bill were to pass both Houses of Congress, there is widespread belief
that the President would veto it.
CMA has no position on the Gibbons bill, but continues to explore
possible revisions to the trade remedy laws focusing on Sections 201, 232,
301 and 332 of the Trade Act.
NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIES;
U.S./CANADA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
The Canadian government has informed the U.S. government it will seek
a free trade arrangement for six industrial sectors including
petrochemicals. The Canadian Chemical Producers Association (CCPA) has
coordinated with its government in preliminary efforts preceding actual
negotiations. It has also asked the government for lower natural gas
prices to make the industry more competitive and the free trade agreement
more beneficial. A well-written report on this issue has been published by
the Canadian petrochemical industry,
CCPA, CMA, SOCMA and SPI representatives met on Tuesday, April 17 in
Toronto, Canada. The petrochesiicals chosen by the Canadians to be included
in the proposed free trade agreement were provided at that meeting, it was
requested by the CCPA that some indication of the reaction of U.S. industry
to the free trade proposal would be welcomed.
A survey questionnaire was presented to the CMA Executive Committee on
Tuesday, May 8 which was designed to provide the requested reaction. The
Executive Committee did not approve the recommended questionnaire and
referred the matter back to the International Trade Committee for further
study.
NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIESt
U.S./ISRAEL FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
Representative Thomas J. Downey (D-NY-2) introduced a bill (H.R. 5377)
in April which, if passed, would authorize the United States to enter into
negotiations with the government of Israel to establish across-the-board
duty free trade betwe n the two nations. Mr. Downey's bill has yet to
undergo hearings in the House, and none are scheduled.
CMA 038200
s
Although Senator John Danforth (R-MO) had intention* of introducing a
companion bill in the Senate, he has since decided instead to attach the
Downey bill as an amendment to some as yet unannounced bill. The Senate
Finance Committee held an executive session on May 10 to consider the
concept of a U.S./Israel free trade arrangement. Although a motion by
Senators Russell Long (D-LA) and David Pryor (D-AR) to exclude the bromine
industry from negotiating authority failed, U.5. Trade Representative
William Brock went on record as offering assurances that all due
consideration would be given to the concerns of the industry.
The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) is currently
conducting an investigation (Inv. 332-180) into the probable economic
impact resulting from a U.S./Israel free trade agreement. Although public
hearings occurred in April, the report on the investigation is not due to
be released until May 30. The USITC reports that no other chemical sector
has expressed concern over the prospects of a U.S./Israel free trade
agreement.
In addition to the concerns of the bromine segment of the chemical
industry over the issue, the proposed U.S./Israel free trade arrangement
raises an additional concern, especially for the petrochemical sector. The
government of Saudi Arabia has informed the U.S. Trade Representative that
it expects the same free trade agreement given Israel.
NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIES;
RECIPROCITY LEGISLATION
The Reciprocal Trade and Investment Act of 1984 continues to be
stalled in the Congress. CMA is in favor of the enactment of the bill,
which is described by its chief sponsor, Senator John Danforth (R-MO), as
one of the only positive pieces of trade legislation before the Congress.
The bill has cleared the Senate Finance Committee five times and has been
passed by the full Senate twice during this Congress. It has been on the
Senate calendar for consideration since February, but continues to be
bumped down in priority due largely to the efforts of organised labor.
Labor has convinced Senator Metzenbaum (D-OH) that passage of the bill
would encourage companies to move their manufacturing facilities overseas
causing a loss of jobs.
CMA continues to plan an active role in the business coalition seeking
passage of this legislation.
NATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIESi
GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES
The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provides for duty-free
treatment for imports into the United states of certain articles, including
chemicals, manufactured in developing countries. Chemical imports under
this duty-free system totaled $400 million in 1982. Some of these cause
member firms significant injury in the U.S. market. The program, which has
been in effect since 1976, is due to expire in January 1985, and must
either be reauthorized or extended by this Congress if it is to continue.
The Administration offered a proposal for the program's renewal (S. 1718)
which was introduced in the last session of Congress by Senator John
Danforth (R-MO) by request. This bill was recently reported out by the
Finance Committee. As of yet, no Senate floor action is scheduled.
CMA 038201
CMA's Myron T. Fovedux testified before the Senate Finance Committee's
International Trade Subcommittee on January 27 on behalf of both CMA and
the Synthetic Organic Chemicals Manufacturers Association (SOCMA) in favor
of the reauthorization of GSP. However, necessary changes were
recommended. Additional GSP hearings were held on February 8 and 9 by the
Trade Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, but CMA had
already presented testimony to that subcommittee in August, 1983.
Although the Administration's GSP renewal proposal has not been
introduced in the House, Representative Pease (D-OH-13) has introduced a
bill (H.R. 5136) to reauthorize the program. It requires adherence to
numerous fair trade law principles as a condition for GSP eligibility. It
also contains a system for permanently removing countries from eligibility,
one of CMA's recommendations for GSP renewal. CMA's International Trade
Committee is preparing this and other proposals in the form of legislative
language for use in the GSP renewal bills.
PRODUCT DISTRIBUTIONi
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRANSPORTATION
Reauthorization hearings have been held in both the Senate Commerce
Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and the House Public works and
Transportation Committee on the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act
(HMTA). Testimony was received from a variety of public and private sector
repres ntatives seeking amendments to the HMTA. Despite the efforts of the
Hazardous Materials Transportation Coalition, made up of industry trade
groups and state and local government officials, to obtain approval of a
package of amendments, it is likely that only a simple reauthorization bill
without significant legislative amendments will be passed in this session
of Congress.
Differences of opinion exist over the roles of federal, state and
local governments in regulating the transport of hazardous materials.
Dispute also centers on the need for and amount of funding for a national
fee, system for carriers, shippers and container manufacturers in exchange
for federal preemptive authority.
Limited provisions to the HMTA may, however, be considered that would
address many of the issues pending at the Department of Transportation
(DOT), that cannot be.immediately resolved by rulemaking. A
Congressionally mandated study is also possible that would require DOT to
determine the need for transporters to notify municipalities before trans­
porting hazardous materials through them, and to evaluate federal emergency
response training programs.
CMA efforts continue with regard to working for national uniform law
of hazardous materials regulation. Internal review also focuses on the
funding mechanism suggested in the coalition proposal and potential
voluntary industry programs.
PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION;
RAILROAD DEREGULATION
Concern has been expressed by coalitions among the aluminum, chemical,
oal, and utility industries that the ICC has disregarded provisions in the
R
Rail
Act that provid consumer and shipper protection. Public sector
1
groups have also asked for Congressional review of ice procedures regarding
railroad rates. Captive traffic has been particularly impacted by the
monopolistic power of the railroads. Issue areas under discussion include
the revenue adequacy of railroads, market dominance and pro-competitive
features.
Senator John Danforth (R-MO) is circulating draft language for a Joint
Congressional Resolution that would deal with how the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC) is implementing the staggers Rail Act of 1980. The
Resolution'may be introduced within two weeks and hearings are expected to
be scheduled. The Joint Resolution would have the effect of law if passed
by Congress and signed by the President.
CMA is supporting the introduction of the Joint Resolution directing
the ICC to comply with Congressional intent and is urging that specific
pro-competitive language should be added to existing law. CMA position
papers and draft language has been submitted to Congressional staff and
many of the CMA provisions are expected to be incorporated.
ENERGY AMD FEEDSTOCK SUPPLIES;
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS LEGISLATION
The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee began markup of
energy emergency preparedness legislation on May 9. A revised version of
S. 1678 offered by Chairman James A. McClure (R-ID) is the markup vehicle.
Differing bills addressing the nation's ability to withstand a severe
energy shortage have been introduced by Senators Bill Bradley (D-NJ) and
Dave Durenberger (R-MN).
The markup process is scheduled to continue on May 16, 23 and possibly
beyond that. The chances of reporting out a bill are uncertain due to
considerable controversy. Debate continues over the federal government's
proper role in a petroleum shortfall. Other issues of concern include
preemption of state laws and antitrust and conflict of interest exemptions
for energy companies and executives called to government service during an
energy emergency.
Many amendments are being prepared and are expected to include standby
federal oil price and allocation controls and emergency financial aid to
the poor and others likely to suffer during an oil shortage. The
Administration has suggested changes to the McClure bill in support of
appropriate legislation without price and allocation authority. In 1981
President Reagan vetoed a standby petroleum allocation bill.
CMA supports the basic free market approach of the McClure bill and
several parts of the Bradley bill. The CMA viewpoint is, however, that
social programs for the economically disadvantaged should not be mixed with
national energy policy. The Durenberger bill is not supported by the CMA
Energy Committee.
COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF CHEMICALS;
TSCA
In the Senate, David Durenberger*s subcommittee staff continues
drafting a TSCA amendment's package which will be^circulated piecemeal as
CMA 038203
"staff drafts”. The first piece should be available in the next month, and
we expect unfriendly proposed changes in the following areas: (1) the
section 4 test rule process, perceived as too slow and unwieldy under
present procedures; (2) a PMN test data requirement, on a rebuttable
presumption basis, for new chemicals; (3) an attempt to reduce claims for
confidential business information, alleged to be excessive under present
law; and (4) some means of getting CPA to make greater use of section 6
control actions on existing chemicals.
In response to these proposals, we have shared with Senate staff the
following concepts:
o
Negotiated testing agreements have improved the section 4 process,
and ought to be recognized in the law.
o
A hazard evaluation statement to be included in a PMN provide
greater assurances' as to the adequacy of the PMN review, in
essence, the statement would evaluate the potential human health
and environmental effects for each new substance, under anticipated
conditions of manufacture, use and exposure.
o
industry be given more time to deal with confidentiality problems
through an educational process designed to limit claims to only
that information truly confidential.
CMA is working with other trade associations in developing positions
to be used at the appropriate time to improve the outcome of Senate and
House efforts to amend TSCA. In the House, Mr. Florio's bill to amend TSCA
(H.R. 4304) is in a holding pattern, pending developments on Superfund
reauthorization.
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH:
DISEASE COMPENSATION
The Senate Labor Subcosraittee hearing April 23 focused on
occupational disease in general, and asbestos in particular. The hearing
was the first of a series that will be continuing through the months of May
and June. Senator Kennedy, as expected, called industry'a.failure to
protect workers from asbestos, and other deadly substances, a public health
tragedy. The usual grim statistics were reported by a colleague of
Dr. Selicoff's, such as the 350,000 asbestos-related deaths to date, and he
predicted 9,000 • 10,000 deaths per year from 1980 to the year 2000.
Finally, a Rand study reports that asbestos victims receive only 1/3 of the
dollars paid out, while 2/3 goes for legal expenses.
Noteworthy however, was the way in which Chairman Don Nickles (R-OK)
framed the issue by asking: first, is there a national asbestos crisis,
and second, if so, what should be done about it? Balance was brought to
the hearing, which cast some doubt on the assumption that asbestos is a
national crisis. Two eminent medical research doctors made a strong case
for the critical need for sound medical/scientifie criteria as a basis fo?
compensating asbestos victims. Fred Baron, a leading attorney for asbestos
victims, and active in the Trial Lawyers Association, conceded there is no
current litigation crisis, and our tort system has evolved rapidly and
responsibily to deal with asbestos victims. (He blames insurance companies
CMA 038204
1
as the primary causa of problems, but says that may soon be solved through
the Wellington group's proposed solution.) He concluded by saying, "X
believe it would be unwise, at this time, to consider a legislative
restructuring of the benefit delivery mechanism now in effect."
while Chairman Nickles' hearing initially focused on asbestos, we are
watching closely for any broadening to other substances/diseases. In
particular, we are watching Senator Quayle's effort to find a sponsor for
the asbestos manufaeturers/users coalition (CEC) bill limited to asbestos,
and an as yet unseen proposal by Senator Kennedy not limited to asbestos.
Congressman Miller's bill (H.R. 3175) remains status quo in the House.
OLD WASTE SITES/CERCLA
Representative James Florio (D-NJ) has recently introduced his third
edition of Superfund reauthorization legislation, H.R. 5640. Florio*s
subcommittee-will markup the bill on May 23 and report it to the full
Committee. The Florio bill is still unacceptable, but has a few changes
such as reauthorization for five years, an amendment to CERCLA, no
administrative fund for victims compensation, but a federal cause of action
and an attempt to codify existing case law on the issue of joint and
several liability.
The legislation has been co-sponsored by at least 34 members of the
House, including a few influential House Democratic committee chairmen and
key House Republicans. House Speaker "Tip" O'Neill has told the Democrats
he wants the Superfund work completed in the committees and ready for floor
vote the beginning of August. O'Neill has told the Democratic House to
force this issue into the national limelight to make it a Presidential
election issue against President Reagan and the Republicans.
Representative Robert Roe (D-NJ) has begun Superfund hearings in his
Water Resources Subcommittee of the Public Works and Transportation
Committee. Roe, who is a co-sponsor of Florio's bill, will not resume the
Superfund hearings until mid June, and CMA will testify at these hearings.
The other House committee with jurisdiction over Superfund, the Ways and
Means Committee, will not begin hearings until the second or third week of
June.
CMA continues to pursue a very aggressive lobbying effort aimed at the
key members of these three House Committees. The CMA Grassroots effort is
also very active back in the home districts of the key members of these
Committees. CMA is working on the issues of funding level and mechanism,
joint and several liability, how clean is clean, victims compensation, plus
other key issues.
Senator Robert Stafford (R-VT) has begun the Senate reauthorization
hearings in the Senate Environment and Public works Committee. CMA
testified on May 16, and Mr. Edwin Holmer, President of Exxon Chemical
Corporation and Chairman of CMA's Board of Directors, presented the
industry's Superfund positions. Of interest to Members of the Committee
were our positions on:
CMA 038206
r
i
o
the annual laval of funding which the Superfund needs and EPA
can administer;
o
joint and several liability;
o
the economic impact of a substantial increase in the feedstock
tax;
o
the viability of a waste-end tax;
o
taxing chemical feedstock imports; and
o
victims compensation.
Stafford will introduce a Superfund bill after he completes his May
hearings. It is possible he may have additional hearings on the
legislation in June.
RESOURCE CONSERVATION AMD RECOVERY ACT (RCRA)
Senate consideration of the RCRA reauthorization bill S. 757 has been
postponed perhaps until after the Congressional Memorial Day recess. Since
the bill was originally reported from the Environment and Public Works
Committee a number of controversial amendments have surfaced which would
requir considerable time to debate on the Senate floor. With the
shortened Congressional calendar due to the upcoming Democratic and
Republican conventions* the Senate leadership apparently is unwilling to
dedicate several days to the RCRA reauthorization bill.
The more controversial amendments which have delayed consideration of
S. 757 include Senator Durenberger's Leaking Underground Storage Tank
(LUST) amendment and the questions of whether or not mining wastes are
subject to RCRA regulations. There are some 15 - 20 other amendments to
th„e bill which together would require substantial time to consider.
CMA's efforts continue to be geared toward adoption of a reasonable
surface impoundment amendment. The latest draft surface impoundment
amendment encompasses most of the major provisions endorsed by CMA.
However, equalization ponds or ponds in which no treatment is occuring
would not be exempted from the double liner requirement. CMA has
approached the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee staff with
proposed language to exempt equalization ponds if the contamination could
be contained. However, it does not appear as though these ponds will be
covered in the final version of the Committee surface impoundment
amendment.
The amendment to be offered by Senators Cranston (D-CA) and Humphrey
(R-NH) to require that up to $50 million of the Superfund is to perform
health studies of populations surrounding landfills and surface
impoundments continues to be reviewed by CMA's technical staff. CMA will
be discussing with the Senators the suggested changes in their amendment
should they be deemed necessary.

CLEAN WATER ACT
The House"Public
Act amendments on May
Chairman James Howard
Subcommittee on May 1
Works and Transportation Committee passed Clean Water
10. The bill, H.R. 3282, was introduced by Committee
(D-NJ) last summer, amended in the Water Resources
and the Cull Committee on May 10.
H.R. 3282 contains few significant improvements over the existing
Clean Water Act, for the chemical industry. The Best Available Technology
(BAT) compliance date extension was included. A BAT study provision has
been substituted for the BAT modification provision which CMA originally
recommended. The Pretreatment Study provision in the bill could yield good
information, but not quick enough to support the local pretreatment
program.
There are several adverse amendments in the Committee-passed bill,
including Post-BAT requirements, EPA administrative civil penalties
authority, and felony sanctions.
CMA1s Technical and Government Relations Clean Water Act Task Groups
provided the House subcommittee and members and staffs with language which
reflected CMA priorities for improvement in the bill. However, Chairman
Howard, with the cooperation of Subcommittee Chairman Robert Roe (D-NJ),
basically held the line on his bill. House floor action on H.R. 3282
depends upon the limited time remaining on the House calendar.
In the Senate, the Committee approved bills S. 431 and S. 2006,
providing for Clean Water Act amendments, could be considered anytime. The
passage of a House committee bill may provide impetus for Senate floor
debate. CMA continues to support an amendment to S. 431 allowing local
pretreatment programs, which Senator Symms (R-ID) is prepared to offer.
SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT (SDWA)
Senator Durenberger's bill, S. 2649, to reauthorize the Safe Drinking
Water Act, was introduced on May 8. The Senate Subcommittee on Toxic
Substances and Environmental Oversights held a one day hearing on May 14.
CMA will testify sometime in early June.
Senator Durenberger1s bill appears to be a substantial improvement
over the House version of the Safe Drinking Water Act, H.R. 3200. The
Senate bill does not change the definition of a "drinking water source" nor
does the bill substantially restrict the use of underground injection wells
as does the House bill. Although the bill contains language in its goals
and policy section which refers to the "protection of groundwater sources
.... from contamination" there are no broad groundwater provisions in the
bill. CMA believes the groundwater issue should be separate from any Safe
Drinking Water Act legislation. An area of concern with the Senate bill is
the absence of cost considerations in determining "feasible" technology.
It is possible that S. 2649 will be reported from the Committee on
Environment and Public Works and maybe considered by the full Senate
sometime this summer. In the House, Congressman Waxman, Chairman of the
Subcommittee on Health of the Energy and Commerce Committee has given no
CMA 038207
indication that ha will schadula hearings for H.R. 3200 in tha foreseeable
future.
CLEAN AIR ACT
On May 2, the House Health and Environment Subcommittee considered the
hazardous air pollutant sections of H.R. 5314. This bill was introduced by
Subcommittee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-CA). Congressman John Dingell
(D-MI), chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee, offered a
positive substitute for the onerous hazardous air pollutant provisions of
H.R. 5314. The Subconsaittee can vote on the Dingell substitute whenever
Waxman reconvenes the Subcommittee.
H.R. 5314 consists of hazardous air pollutant provisions only, since
May 2 when the acid rain provisions which industry opposed were'voted out
in Subcommittee.
CMA and the inter-industry group on Section 112 of the Clean Air Act
(hazardous pollutants) are working to win at least one vote necessary for
approval of the Dingell substitute. CMA also is developing materials to
assist in any full committee consideration of hazardous air pollutants. In
addition, CMA and industry continues to urge that constructive amendments
on PSD and non-attainment, for example, be included in any clean air bill
that moves in the House this year.
In the Senate, the committee report to accompany the comprehensive
clean air bill S. 768 was issued on May 3. S. 768 now appears on the
Senate calendar for floor debate. Lack of consensus among the full Senate
on acid rain control, such as S. 768 contains, and lack of House progress
toward a comprehensive bill explain Senate inaction at present.
STATE LEVEL COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION
STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY
For the balance of the year, some states will be addressing issues
of great importance to our industry. In Pennsylvania and Michigan the
industry is trying to work out a compromise on right to know; New Jersey
and Massachusetts are working on the public compensation issue and
Louisiana is promoting a large number of hazardous waste proposals. Tha
CIC's, industry personnel and CMA will continue to work on these issues.
There has been some restructuring and strengthening of some of
the existing CIC's. Along with the hiring of experienced legislative
counsel in some states, many organizations have been extremely
successful with their legislative activities.
The upcoming annual matting of the National Conference of Stata
Legislatures will prasant discussions on Environmental Conflict Managamant,
Worker Right to Know, Groundwater, Superfund and Public Compensation. The
National Governors Association's annual meeting will Include soma
discussions on acid rain, groundwater and toxics integration.
STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE;
PROGRAMS UNDERWAY
Members of the Environmental Task Group will be participating in an
air toxics risk assessment workshop sponsored by the Northeast States for
Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM). The purpose of the meeting is to
illustrate how toxic air contaminant risk evaluation processes are employed.
Topics will include toxicological concepts, review of risk assessment
models, risk assessment case studies and risk management practices.
The Hazardous Materials Transportation Task Group participated in
the annual conference of the Hazardous Materials Advisory Council
(HMAC) which was held in Arlington, Virginia. The conference was
attended by federal and state regulatory officials, state legislators
and members of industry. Discussion centered on restrictions on
hazardous materials transportation and cooperative efforts to find
solutions.
KEY ISSUE;
SUPERFUND AND HAZARDOUS WASTE
Although a number of state legislatures have already adjourned, some
states continue to be active in the Superfund and hazardous waste area.
Amendments have been introduced to the New Jersey Spill Compensation and
Control Act to change the existing "front end" tax to a waste end disposal
tax. Other favorable changes include the followingt
o
Broadening the base of taxpayers from approximately 220 to
1500 firms.
o
Providing for exemptions from the proposed new tax for
beneficially reused or recycled material.
o
Providing companies which transport hazardous waste to another
state which levies a disposal tax with a 90% credit on the New
Jersey tax amount.
In Alabama, hazardous waste legislation would allow no extension
or changes in disposal techniques or sites without legislative approval.
This would also apply to industries who dispose on-site. A separate bill
would allow on-site inspectors at all hazardous waste sites who would be
funded through fees on industry.
CMA 038209
A substitute bill has been introduced in Michigan to replace
legislation which would have required all handlers of hazardous waste and
material in underground tanks to carry liability insurance. Claims could
have been made by people exposed to the hazardous waste. The new
legislation, as modified, is much more acceptable to industry.
It is
anticipated that this bill will pass before the July recess.
KEY ISSUE;
RIGHT TO KNOW
Although the briefing schedule has now been finalized for the
litigation on the federal hazard communication standard, no decision is
expected before next year. Plans are also moving forward under the
auspices of the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce to challenge the New
Jersey state right to know law in the near future.
In other states, the deadlock in the Michigan Senate Labor Committee
continues over the competing labor and industry right to know bills. While
negotiations are continuing, no movement of the labor bill is foreseen at
this time. A House floor vote is expected in Pennsylvania in late May on
an industry backed bipartisan amendment to the onerous bill which has
passed out of committee. The chances of the industry provisions being
accepted have increased significantly in recent months.
t
The Governor has signed legislation in Iowa and another bill in
Maryland is expected to be signed in the near future. Neither of
these proposals will have a significant adverse impact on the chemical
industry.
Other legislative activity is ongoing in Louisiana, Illinois,
Delaware, Rhode Island and Florida. The Louisiana and Florida bills
are the most significant.
Regulatory activity is still pending on onerous statutes in New
Jersey, Massachusetts and Illinois.

KEY ISSUE;
I
PUBLIC COMPENSATION
The state public compensation situation has stabilized during the past
month. New Jersey remains the only major threat to pass legislation this
year. However, as more time passes before the hearing process begins, the
likelihood for passage this session diminishes significantly.
In other states, the study commission in Massachusetts continues to
meet and take testimony weekly. A report is expected before the end of the
year with serious discussions of legislation very likely in 1985. Activity
in New York is focused on changing the existing statute of limitations for
tort claims from the present restrictive rule to the more liberal and
generally accepted discovery rule, other states with the potential for
activity this year are California and Illinois.

KEY ISSUE,-
AIR
Development of the Massachusetts air toxic program is nearing
completion. A Chemical Health Effects Methodology (CHEM) provides for
the ranking of chemicals based on the severity of potential health effects,
with regulations and standards adopted for those substances which are
ranked highest on the list. The final result of this methodology could
be an enforceable ambient emissions limit for a given air toxic. The state
regulatory agency has generated possible ambient numbers for 100 of 440
chemicals identified as potential Massachusetts air toxics. Industry
members feel that a more complete description is needed on how cancer
potency is derived and there is a need to develop a system which allows for
the review of new data.
The air toxics program is scheduled for completion by July of
this year. Maine will begin to develop an air toxics program sometime
this summer. It is anticipated that the program will focus on
modeling rather than ambient monitoring.
KEY ISSUE:
WATER
Florida has adopted regulations described as the toughest in the
country to insure safe drinking water for the ten million people served by
community wells in the state. Because no guidelines have been set by the
Environmental Protection Agency, the state relied heavily on the findings
of experts in the toxicological field. The rules impose standards on eight
contaminants and require monitoring of 120 other toxins. They require that
all water systems serving more than 25 customers be tested every three
years for traces of vinyl chloride and benzene, known carcinogens, as well
as five other volatile organic chemicals suspected of causing cancer
in humans.
KEY ISSUE;
CHRONIC HEALTH
Activity in the chronic health area at the state level continues to
increase. Legislation which has been introduced in California would create
a Center for Disease Control to identify and research diseases caused by
environmental agents. Michigan's bill, if passed, would require the
Department of Public Health to maintain a cancer registry to aid in
complete epidemiologic surveys of cancer related diseases and to apply
appropriate preventive and control measures. A number of other states
including Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey and New York have introduced
similar legislation.
KEY ISSUE;
TRANSPORTATION
Transportation legislation has been introduced in Pennsylvania would
would place additional requirements and restrictions on many industry
shippers. Industry's concerns with the bill include the following:
o
Transporters remain under the "Right to Know" licensing
requirements and must obtain a license for hazardous
chemicals handled on quantities greater than 500 pounds
or 55 gallons.
CMA 038211
o
Hazardous materials transporter* with no origin or
destination in the city may not leave the interstate
highway, this appears to preclude stops for repairs,
meals, and
change of drivers.
o
The Fire Commissioner is directed to write regulations
"reasonably" restricting the transport of hazardous
chemicals.
o
Shippers and receivers are required, under penalty of law,
to notify suppliers and transporters with whom they
do business about requirements.
The Pennsylvania Chemical industry Council has been very active
on this issue and will be the coordinating mechanism for future action
on this bill as it becomes necessary.

MINUTES OF LAST MEETINGS
Chairman Sella called the meeting to order at 8:00 a.m. The minutes of
the June 5 and 6, 1985 Board meetings vere approved as distributed.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
A summary of the committee's annual report Is attached as Exhibit A.
DINGELL SURVEY ON AIR EMISSIONS
Mr. Berryman reviewed the results of the survey on air emissions and
emergency response capabilities and practices. Key findings of the survey included:
A significant amount of safety equipment and procedures are in place.
The industry has a very active inspection and safety review program.
Air emission measuring apparatus and techniques are In place or
applied near the .process unit rather than at the fenceline or in the
community.
There Is substantial operator input (human factor) in most of these
monitoring and safety systems.
The report will be delivered to Congressman Dlngell later in September
following completion and final review of the contractors' analysis of the data.
There was considerable discussion concerning the ultimate public release of the
report and the Individual company's ability to be able to effectively respond to
the issues that might be raised.
STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
The comnlttee's annual report, supplemented with Chairman Fort's report.
Is attached as Exhibit B.
STATE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS
Mr. Wood presented the report (Exhibit C) of an ad hoc group which had
studied the status and programs of the various state chemical Industry ass clations. Mr. Wood highlighted the following findings and recommendations:
The 18 state groups represent a significant resource to the industry.
CMA has done a good job In the past 4-5 years In nurturing and
supporting these groups.
CMA 038293
2293
CMA needs Co continue co evaluate and find appropriate ways to
utilize the resource chat these groups represent, while recognizing
chat some states will always be able to do more chan others.
Member company senior executives need to provide strong, top down
personal and corporate support for these groups.
Some additional expenditure of CMA resources in the form of seed
money would be desirable.
There was considerable discussion of the relative strengths of the state
organizations, the need for additional state groups, and the role of the Board and
the individual Directors in moving these programs forward and in resolving any
problems or shortfalls in company involvement. The view was expressed that the
Board and the Individual Directors feel the need to have continuing input, as
appropriate, on those areas where their action, either individually or collec­
tively, is warranted. Mr. Roland indicated that there would be appropriate
follow-up action based on the data in the report and the Board's request.
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS COMMITTEE
A summary of the committee's annual report is attached as Exhibit D.
TAX REFORM LEGISLATION

CRC programs. The funding request was referred to the Finance
Committee. Other areas reported as impacted were plant safety, air
toxics and risk perception and acceptance.
Discussed the tax reform issue and its relative priority. Agreed
that it should be a high priority issue, but that it should noc
divert Association resources from Superfund and therefore should be
addressed utilizing principally member company personnel. Requested
that an appropriate action plan be prepared.
TREASURER'S REPORT
Mr. Herman reported on the most current financial report available
which covered the first two months of the fiscal year through July 31. In this

REPORT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
September 9, 1985
executive summary
MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS
The Environmental Management Conittae's 1984-1985 year van once again
full* diversified, and productive. The Committee effectively and
successfully managed environental Matter* before regulatory agencies,
Congress, federal courts, and the public. In addition, the WC is
working closely with the State Affairs Committee to address evolving
a%ate environmental issues. A description of the IMC's major
accomplishments is set forth in Qiapter Z. A swaary of these
accomplishments includes >
o The 2MC, in conjunction with the Government Relations Committee
has actively advocated reauthorisation and appropriate amendment of the full spectrum of enviroimmntal legislation ~
superfund, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA),
the Safa Drinking water Act, Clean Air Act, and Clean Water
Act. The end result of the 1984-85 efforts was a comprehensive
amendment of RCRA. CMA efforts resulted in significant
modifications to the RCRA amandsents to make several require­
ments more palatable. We hevei
(1) proposed sound legisla­
tive alternatives; (2) promoted aendaents that assure costeffective requirements; and (3) have opposed amendments that
impose unjustified restraints on industry operation and
potential growth or those that offer little or no commensurate
environmental benefits. At this time, there is a
real likelihood that mendments to the Clean Water Act,
Superfund, and the safe Drinking Water Act will be enacted
this year.
o One of the key elements of CMA's haxardous waste management
program is to establish industry trends in member company
hazardous waste disposal practices. To achieve this objec­
tive the OIC conducted for the third year, a survey of
waste disposal practices for 1983, and is managing a similar
survey for 1984* The three year survey results show very
favorable disposal practice trends. The survey results have
proven to be a vary valuable element in OtA's Superfund
legislative and communications progrms, and as a part of the
full spectrum of solid waste advocacy activities.
o During the past year, the rapidly escalating issue of air
toxics has taken up an increased level of activity and has
great significance to the DIC and the industry in the past
year. The IMG managed a survey requested by Congressman
Dingell on monitoring and detection systems for chemicals and
emergency respons systems at chenieel industry plants. In a
CMA 038300
rwlated uptcti the EMC has established an ad hoe group to
davalop a comprehensive work plan for air toxics. Although wa
ara still in tha initial phasas of this activity CMA's efforts
hava already begun to obtain results. Wa ware prepared to
address in a constructive yat forceful nature tha first of what
could be a series of legislative proposals on air toxics
enissions. This activity will be one of tha critical issues
CMA/IMC will be addressing in the next few years.
o A second area of increased activity is in the groundwater
area. The EMC has had in place for the past year an Ad Hoc
Groundwater coordinating Coesaittaa to assure overall coordina­
tion of CMA ccsmittee activities in implementing CMA's
groundwater work plan. The implementation of the work plan is
necessary to address groundwater related issues at both the
state and federal level. CMA's activities have been
effective in assuring that the reauthorization of the Safe
Drinking water Act does not became the vehicle for addressing
groundwater issues. CMA is viewed by members of Congress,
and ZPA as being in the forefront on groundwater matters and
is looked to by other industry groups to play a leadership
role.
o CMA continues to promote a reasonable implementation of the
existing and recently mended PCRA hazardous waste require­
ments. One of the key EMC activities was to conduct three
educational seminars on the new RCM amewhants, and compliance
with PCRA substantive and procedural requirements• The
seminars were held in conjunction with the Council of Chemical
Associations. On the regulatory issues, CMA efforts have been
primarily geared to assure that technically sound ACRA regular
tions are being developed in a timely fashion. Of specific
concern are IPA's regulations for implementing the land
disposal ban requirements. In light of the new AC PA regulatory
requirements, we anticipate a vary high level of activity of
the ACAA Regulations Task Group in addressing the new imple­
menting regulations to assure that they are needed, technically
characteristics, and transport of contaminants.
Ebr states where groundwater
quantity is a concern, this may not be separable from the quality issue. States
may choose to regulate the withdrawal of groundwater as may be appropriate to
protect groundwater quality as part of its state groundwater quality protection
program. CMA does not see a federal role in state evaluation of water quality
impacts of withdrawal programs and statutes.
Under some circumstances, such as in vulnerable hydrogeological areas,
state or local governments may choose to implement planning of the use of the
Land (for future activities) overlying the aquifer or the recharge zone to
assure protection of groundwater quality. Land use and soils information should
be used in conjunction with aquifer mapping to develop appropriate land use
management decisions. Such controls may include zoning restrictions,
requirements for septic tank placement, requirements for the siting of new
facilities where potential adverse impacts from groundwater contamination are
especially significant, restrictions on other activities related to land use
that may potentially affect groundwater quality.

f ^quifar mapping and soils information.
Where point source discharges to groundwater are not currently permitted
under existing regulations, states may choose to incorporate a permit system
under their groundwater quality protection progrms to regulate discharges to
groundwater. Where a permit system is employed, CMA endorses the use of permits
with performance-based limits and conditions.

INTRODUCTION
relative to other CMA issues, energy is not a major concern at
this time.
Crude oil prices have dropped.
Fuel oil prices
have remained stable.
Natural gas prices have declined.
The
supply of oil, gas, coal and electricity is not a current
problem.
Under this type of environment the Energy
Committe®'5 charter "to ensure equal access at competitive
prices to supplies of feedstocks and energy" moves in the
direction of stewardship.
The meeting schedule has been
reduced and we have worked to establish energy-oriented ad hoc
coalitions as a cost effective means of promoting CMA energy
positions.
Despite this apparently benign energy environment, issues
remain that can impact the chemical industry now and in the
future.
• Comprehensive gas legislation is unlikely this year but
some form of gas legislation may come up as an amendment.
• The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)- has become
the battleground for key gas issues not requiring
legislation, such as transportation, pricing, access to
supply, and establishment of an interstate competitive gas
market.
• The government's search for additional revenue continues,
thus the possibility of new energy taxes.
• Efforts are under way to establish- protectionist trade
barriers for refined petroleum products.
• Traditional cost-based pricing of electricity is being further
challenged before the FERC in the proposed rule making for
electricity.
• Increased government energy data collection is likely.

ORGANIZATION AND ISSUES 1985 - 1986
The Energy Committee was reorganized at its June 20-21 planning
meeting to address the anticipated energy issues through four task
groups. Natural Gas, Energy Taxes, Petroleum and Technical Issues
which includes electricity, energy conservation and government
reporting.
f
* Natural Gas Issues
f
In the fourth quarter of 1984, CMA successfully opposed
Congressional legislation to reregulate natural gas.
This
marked the last serious legislative effort in natural gas,
and no comprehensive gas legislation is likely this year.
There is, however, always the risk of fragmented natural gas
legislation as amendments to other bills. Since deregulation >
January 1, 1985 of approximately 50% of wellhead gas pricing
under the Natural Gas Policy Act, the battleground for gas
has shifted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission '
I
(FERC). Because of the quasi-legal atmosphere and the
associated high cost, CMA established procedures
for cooperative efforts with other industrial gas consumer
groups involving the shared use of outside legal counsel in
responding to a broad public inquiry by the Federal En rgy
Regulatory Commission on natural gas transmission and
pipeline ratemaking. The FERC will decide this matter
I
in the fourth quarter of this year.
Objectives for 1985 - 1986
The CMA will continue to advocate legislation which will
bring about a free market and enhanced supply; i.e.,
deregulation of wellhead ceiling prices and removal of all
market restraints. The major effort, however, will b
directed to FERC regulatory reform to enhance natural gas
market competition which by its nature is dependent upon
equal access and transportation of natural gas supplies.
Stake;
Assurance of natural gas as a source of energy and
feedstocks on a competitive price basis. Foster
Associates, a natural gas consultant, has conservatively
estimated a possible impact of $.25/MMBTU or $750 million
per year on CMA member companies from the pricing
provisions of the current FERC Docket on regulatory refora >
of natural gas.
CMA 038397
3
Natural Gas Task Group Projects for 1985 - 1986 include:
Continue participation in FERC Docket No. RM85-1 on
natural gas regulatory reform, and develop CMA responses
to subsequent related FERC actions; particular attention
will be given to generic or precedent-setting issues such
as equal access to all gas (particularly the Outer
Continental Shelf [OCS]), pipeline ratemaking, and
curtailment priorities that may not be settled in Docket
Continue support for correcting legislative deficiencies
under the Natural Gas Policy Act and removal of
incremental pricing and prohibitions against the use of
natural gas.
Coordinate with other trade groups and support appropriate
coalition actions consistent with CMA's position and goals.
Energy Tax Issues
The CMA in the first half of 1985 successfully opposed an
attempt to implement an oil import fee as part of th
federal budget deficit reduction package. The Energy
Committee provided focus and technical support to th CMA
Tax Policy and Government Relations Committees during this
campaign. Congressional leaders, though divided, hav
continued to demonstrate a willingness to consider some
form of energy taxation as a means to generate revenue
during the coming year.
Objectives for 1985 - 1986
Avoid any new energy-tax-based revenue-generating scheme.
If such a tax is imposed, limit the impact on energy and
exclude feedstock.
Stake: A tax of $5/bbl. on oil has been estimated by the
consultant firm of Data Resources, Inc.(DRI) to decrease
chemical production by at least 5t and eliminate 15,000
chemical jobs per year through 1990.
Energy Tax Group Projects 1985 - 1986 include:
• Maintain the capability to analyze and develop respons s
to various energy tax proposals and studies.
CMA 038398
4
* Coordinate Energy Committee analyses and recommendations
with those of CMA Tax Policy and Government Relations
Committees.
* Carry the CMA position to appropriate divisions and
agencies within the Administration and to the Congress.
* Coordinate with other trade groups, and support
appropriate coalition action consistent with CMA's
position and goals.
Petroleum Issues
The CMA position is that market forces, as opposed to
price and allocation controls, are the most ffective
means to distribute petroleum products in the event of a
declared emergency. CMA's position prevailed in the
extension of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by
Congress.
The CMA must be watchful in the coming'year
that the development of regulations to implement the
recent legislation do not nibble away at the fre market
concept.
In addition, protection from low-priced for ign imports
is being sought by a coalition of mostly small refiners
through the imposition of import quotas and/or import
fees.
Objectives for 1985 - 1986
The CMA will resist any effort to modify Department of
Energy regulatory policy and procedure away from the
current free market concepts.
In addition, the CMA will continue to oppose efforts to
create additional protectionist trade barriers which
would raise the cost of U. S. petrochemical raw
materials above world competitive levels.
Stake:
Availability of hydrocarbon raw materials and fuels at
competitive prices.
Petroleum Issues Projects for 1985 - 1986 includ :
• Maintain liaison with the DOE Cabinet Council, Congress,
the National Petroleum Council, and related trade
associations.
CMA 038399

* Develop responses on petroleum issues consistent with
the CMA position.
* Support appropriate coalition actions consistent with
CMA's position and goals.
Technical Issues
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is
reviewing electrical energy rate setting for the
interstate grid in its notice of inquiry, FERC Docket No.
85-17, Phase 1 and 2. The CMA joined with other trade
groups to advocate the continuance of cost of service
as the basis for rate design.
Public hearings and rule
making are expected in the fourth quarter of this year.
In addition, the Department of Energy plans to conduct a
survey of plant Manufacturing Energy Consumption
(MECS). The CMA has already testified and responded to
the Energy Information Administration (EIA) proposals '
for its MECS survey as to burden, sensitivity of
information, and its potential misuse. The EIA plans to
pursue a pilot survey in late 1985 and a full survey in
1986. It is the intent of the EIA to use this
information in responding to energy planning initiatives
by branches of the government.
Objectives for 1985 - 1986
The CMA will continue to seek cost of service as the
basis for electric rate design.
In addition, the CMA will continue to oppose unnec ssary
energy reporting.
Stake:
The FERC in Docket 85-17 will consider marginal cost
pricing. & O.li per KWH increase in rates would cost
CMA companies $85 million per year (based on 1984 CMA
member-company usage of 85 billion kilowatt hours).
In completing the MECS survey, individual plants could
incur up to $5,000 in additional reporting costs. The
ElA's intent to project energy usage from historic data
could give incorrect conclusions when responding to
government inquiries such as allocation controls.
CMA 038400

Technical Issues Task Group Projects for 1985 - 1986
include:
• Maintain technical liaison with the Electricity
Consumers Resource Council (ELCON) and the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI).
• Evaluate and recommend CMA responses to positions taken
by ELCON and EPRI.
Work through the Office of Management and Budget to
prevent or, if need be, modify the proposed EIA/MECS
survey.
Promote and support appropriate coalition activity
consistent with CMA's position and goals.
The effectiveness of the Energy Committee is the direct result of
the support derived from the participating member-company
personnel. As Chairman, I appreciate their talent and need th ir
dedication to meet the objectives set by the 1985 - 1986 Energy
Committee.

REPORT OF THE ENGINEERING ADVISORY COMMITTEE
TO THE CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
SEPTEMBER TO, 1985
Good morning. I'm delighted to have this opportunity to talk a
little bit about the Engineering Advisory Committee. Your program book
contains our formal report and I don't intend to go over that in detail.
I will use one or two specific examples from that report to illustrate
some points I would like to make and, of course, will do my best to
answer any
questions it engenders - or questions arising from anything
else, for that matter. But I would like to editorialize a bit upon the
bare listing of specific activities to leave with you the following ideas.
First, EAC's major role, namely that of dealing with codes and
standards, is an advocacy activity. Although it is not the type of ad­
vocacy you
will read about very often on the front page of the New York
Times, and
it may or may not be dealingwith a government entity, it is
nevertheless an advocacy not dissimilar to CMA's main thrusts.
The second important thought is that CMA is uniquely positioned
to perform that advocacy. In discussing this point. I'd like to take you
through the criteria EAC uses in selecting the tasks where that advocacy
is an essential element and lead you to the final thought, namely, that
the EAC activities have a high payout for a very modest expenditure.
To those who are not close to standards activities, it might
seem that setting standards should be a straightforward technical job, or
pure science If you will, about as controversial as 2 + 2 • 4; that the
only problem should be to arrive at the best technical solution to which
all rational experts would readily subscribe___ Oh, would that It were so
It is perhaps appropriate to spend just a few minutes to refresh
our memories on the general framework of the standards system. In the
U.S., standards are "voluntary" or "consensus", although in many in­
stances one or more governmental jurisdictions give them the force of law
after they are prepared - The National Electric Code is a classic ex­
ample. As a voluntary standard it represents good engineering practice.
But all or parts of It have also been enacted into law by virtually every
local, state and federal governmental body involved with the regulation
of either construction or personal safety,...from local building codes to
OSHA.
The umbrella organization for the voluntary standards system Is
the American National Standards Institute, known as ANSI for short. ANSI
does not write any standards! What it does do Is oversee the consensus
process. When 1 £ deternrlnes there has been a reasonable opportunity for
all interested parties to voice a contribution and that all valid objec-
CMA 038402
2
tions have been either resolved or adjudicated, it will "adopt" the
document as an ANSI standard. There are perhaps 30 or 40 thousand of
such ANSI Standards. Of these, I would guess that something in the range
of 5 to 7 thousand are of direct or indirect interest to the chemical in­
dustry.
In addition, there are many standards of interest that have
never gone through the "ANSI-fication" process. Just to name one, the
standard of the Tubular Exchanger Manufacturer's Association or TEMA,
which forms the backbone for most of the industry's shell and tube heat
exchanger purchases, remains as a manufacturer's agreement, not ANSI
document.
How then do standards get into the ANSI system?
There are
several acceptable procedures. The three most comnon are: (1) consensus
conmittee, (2) accredited organization or (3) canvass.
The consensus
conmittee approach was originally predominant in the ANSI system.
In
using this path, an adhoc committee is convened, inherently containing
consensus, that is, the conmittee members are carefully selected to
represent parties of interest—classically manufacturers, users, techni­
cal experts, the public and any special interests. The committee's out­
put is subjected to public comment, and when all negative conments have
been resolved, the document Is adopted as a standard. Many of our basic
process industry engineering standards were developed in this fashion,
for example, B31 Process Piping, B16-Flanges, 878 AYS pumps, etc.
However, this mode is gradually shifting over to other forms. Major in­
put to the content of such standards must come primarily from parti­
cipating on the working conmittee. At the moment, CMA/EAC has only four
representatives to such conmittees, so you can see we have been highly
selective. Over the years, member company direct participation has been
high In such activities and still forms the backbone of chemical industry
input.
It is only where member company direct participation cannot
accomplish the goals that CMA participation is undertaken. Most often
this occurs when only organizations, not individuals or companies are
admitted to membership. I'll say more about this subject a little later.
The second procedure recognized by ANSI is that of the ac­
credited organization. Here ANSI certifies that the procedures of the
sponsoring organization provide for achieving consensus.
Essential
elements Include public access to the work and requires broad based com­
mittee participation, notification requirements, rights of appeal,
recordkeeping, and mechanisms to resolve any conflict. Many of our most
used standards are developed this way, including the ASME Boiler and
Pressure Vessel Code and our favorite example - the National Electric
Code which is under the aegis of the National Fire Protection Association
CMA 038403
In many aspects it is difficult to perceive the differences
between the consensus coumittee and the accredited organization. Work on
the NEC for example is carried out by 20 code-making panels, each of
about 25 members plus an equal number of alternates. CMA-EAC partici­
pates on the 15 panels which most closely affect the chemical industry
(26 total representatives, provided by member companies at member company
expense). Code panel composition includes representation from equipment
manufacturers, government officials, trade unions, technical societies,
the building industry, contractors, consumer advocates, metal industries,
insulation manufacturers, other trade associations (NEMA, BTC), vendors,
the utility industry and probably others I missed as I skinmed the list.
The motivations in such a diverse group obviously differ. There are many
opportunities for honest differences of technical opinion, based on the
diverse perspectives represented - that after all, is what the consensus
system is all about. But it is also possible for pet ideas, or even
special Interests, to be pressed beyond the point of justification.
Just one example. At the last revision of the NEC, certain
interests sought to include a requirement for a motor disconnect switch
physically at each motor - offering as justification the safety of
persons working on the motor. For most users, this is a matter of in­
difference. Not so in the process Industries where such a local switch
would normally have to be explosion proof. It is CMA's position that
current tag and lockout procedures on remote disconnect devices provide
demonstrably adequate protection and that the proposal creates greater
safety hazards than the one It is Intended to correct. If the proposal
were adopted, we estimated the cost to CMA member companies at 40 MS/yr,
based on the then current rate of new construction. Although the amount
of new construction varies, we observe that the normal time interval
between adoption of a
standard for safety applicable only to new con­
struction and the first voice
of regulation suggesting retrofit is
generally measured In milliseconds. In this case, no estimate of retro­
fit cost has been made.
One feature of the ANSI system, Intended to minimize obsoles­
cence, is that each standard must be revised or reaffirmed within a 3
year interval. The proposal on motor disconnects was turned back at the
working conmlttee level for both the 1981 and 1984 versions of the NEC.
Current activities are
aimed at the 1987 NEC. Once again the proposal
has failed sufficient committee support for adoption (tie vote). How­
ever, this time appeal has brought It forth for public comnent, prepara­
tory to a floor fight at the NFPA convention. The Immediate task at hand
is to encourage sufficient "public" conment to lay the foundation for a
successful floor fight If It Is carried that far. The electrical task
group Is currently organizing such a campaign among member companies and
other sympathizers. The NFPA membership assembled in convention Is the
CMA 038404
court of ultimate appeal in so far as technical content of the NEC is
concerned.
Although members of the NFPA are obviously interested in
safety, only a small percentage will be technically versed in matters
electrical.
I think the parallels with other forms of advocacy are
obvious.
It is also obvious that a single decision does not make a
threat go away. Like bad pennies, these things keep coming back and back!
In addition to the consensus committee and accredited organi­
zation modes of adoption, there is a third In frequent use - the canvass
method. Here the document is prepared by non-representative means, then
submitted for public comment and acceptance. All negatives must be re­
solved.
Typical organizations using this approach include the Under­
writers Laboratories, the API, and our old friends, the National Board of
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors. Most of the activities from this
source (with the exception of the National Board) are less demanding on
the committee, per se, but do Impact on CMA staff. Continued partici­
pation however, is a necessary prerequisite to our credibility when
claiming to represent the chemical manufacturing industry in other
matters.
Let me turn away from the ANSI tutorial to the question of how
EAC selects Its tasks. In a very few cases, only organizations such as
CMA representing identifiable blocks of Interest will have access. Here
obviously. If it Is worth doing, CMA should do It. The option is absten­
tion. There are only seven official CMA representatives (plus two alter­
nates) in such categories.
I mentioned before that the major standards effort comes from
direct member company participation rather than CMA participation. EAC
does attempt to track participation In areas of significant interest and
maintain an informal liaison with member company reps. This contributes
to a broader coverage and less redundant effort.
Where the tracking Indicates a lack of coverage In an area of
interest, we try to encourage some member company to fill the gap. It
was this gap Identification effort that some years ago spotted the fact
that there was no user Industry participation on the NEC panels. In this
case, the task was so complex that a more formal response was judged to
be needed and a coordinated effort was mounted which has been highly
effective. The bulk of the effort Is still provided directly by member
company volunteers, but without the coordination available only through
CMA, the total Industry cost to participate would have been much higher
and is unlikely to have been as effective. (19 companies, 1 member each
on T.G. 29 reps to NEC) The strength of a well thought out, unified
industry position has been amply demonstrated.
CMA 038405
Just because £ standard is used by the chemical industry does
not make it an issue. The EAC does not worry about, nor deal with, the
dimensions of bolt threads. We don't care much about flanges so long as
the flange we will buy next month will mate with the one we bought last
month.
But if there is an effort at significant change, as with the
metrication thrust of a few years ago, even flange dimensions can become
a key issue. These "crises" come and go.
The EAC relies primarily on its informal liaison with member
company representatives as well as its own membership to surface the
problem areas which are appropriate for CMA attention. Appropriateness
is measured by potential impact on the industry and whether CMA is needed
(as opposed to member company rep handling the matter with some
support). The net result is the very selective direct involvement by the
EAC mentioned before, but a much wider behind-the-scenes impact with both
indirect and direct savings out of proportion to the modest budget.
I don't want to leave you with the Impression that looking at a
few standards represents the sum total of EAC activities. Response to
pertinent regulation and legislation is a clear mandate. For example,
this year we had expected two OSHA proposals on electric safety topics.
We were not disappointed when they didn't Issue ........ but they will be
One of our concerns growing out of several years of arm
wrestling with the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel
Inspectors and the relatively satisfactory outcome at the national level
is that the arena will shift to the state level. The National Board is,
after all, composed entirely of senior state level appointees, and the
state capitals are their natural habitat. The EAC has been working with
State Affairs 01 vision to attempt to work out. an effective early warning
system that will be both comprehensive and cost effective. A necessary
adjunct will be the necessary backup and support to the local CIC, if and
as required.
The EAC has for a number of years, sponsored a Computer User
Forum, at two year Intervals. These educational sessions In a rapidly
moving technology have been extremely well received and are generally
self-supporting.
This year. In partial response to the Bhopal incident, the EAC
undertook to conduct a similar forum on Inspection and maintenance and
instructed a newly formed task group to focus on safety through inspec­
tion and maintenance procedures and techniques.
This group will be
holding its third meeting next week, and seems well on the way to
creating an informative and constructive session.
CMA 038406
6
For the coining year, we plan:
to continue the programs already in place, especially those
related to the NEC and the two forums planned.
We need to continue to strive for a comprehensive and cost
effective mechanism for dealing with state level regulation
of pressure equipment.
In preparation for the storm of regulatory legislation that
in the wake of Bhopal and later incidents now seems in­
evitable, we need to position the EAC to support the
Association most effectively. Some parts of this can and
will be undertaken at EAC initiative—for example, an in­
creased Interaction with and support to the Safety and Health
Committee seems appropriate. But the EAC, by the nature of
the subjects It deals with and the normal working assignments
of Its members, is essentially a reactive, not a proactive
group. Therefore, the majority of issues needing attention
will necessarily flow from the Association to the EAC for
supporting contribution and/or prime responsibility.

progress is being made in CPA's implementation of this progm.
A continuing resource commitment is necessary to assure
continued reasonable and cost-effective implementation of
Superfund. The BMC has addressed several key elements of
EVA's Superfund implementing progm (i.a., revised national

QIC LEADER TRAINING
The most valuable resource tha BMC and CMA have is the member company
volunteers that participate on our connittee, its 18 task groups, and
40 work groups. Tha me, its 18 task groups, and work groups have
held approximately 240 formal CMA meetings in tha past yaar. In
order to most affectively use these resources, tha BMC developed and
implemented a leader effectiveness training progrm. The program
provides the leaders basics on antitrust, CMA organisation, qia and
me rules and procedures, and principles of meeting leadership
effectiveness. Tha training "instructors* primarily came from QtA
staff and QIC members. Tha meeeting effectiveness segment of the
course was developed for use by tha training department of BASF
Wyandotte Corporation. To data, 61 parsons have participated in tha
course.
BMC EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS
One of the responsibilities of tha Environmental Management Comsdttee
is to help mambar companies understand their environmental responsi­
bilities. The BMC has mat this challenge by holding semi-annual
anvironuntal updates on all significant CoBittee activities, and
conducting other sasd.nars on major issues on an as needed basis. In
*^ha past year, the BMC has sponsored 2 updates and 6 seminars on a
wide spectrum of environmental issues (i.e., groundwater treatment,
ACRA amentaents/RCRA compliance, water quality basad permits). The
CMA 038302
seminars are routinely open to all 0<A and Chemical Industry Council
members, and on a case-by-case baaia opan to othar organizations

Other OtA staff working on SMC activities include the equivalent
of three and one half attorneys from the Xiegal Department, three
professionals from the GovernaMnt Relations Department, and assistance
from the State Affairs Division and Communications Department, as
needed. During the next year, we expect a need to maintain this level
of support from all other departments within CMA.
RESEARCH AND CONSULTING
The total IY 84/85 budget for me research and consulting projects was
set by the Board of Directors at 9218,000. As the fiscal year pro­
gressed, other comittee funds beeme available and the actual EMC
expenditures totalled 9229,500 as detailed on pages 18 through
21. The research and consulting budget approved for EMC activities
for FT 85/86 is 9360,000. This figure does not include unanticipated
funding needs for issues that arose or have significantly escalated
after the funding process began. In light of the increasing level of
environmental activities, noted above, the current budget may not be
adequate. It is likely that some necessary projects can not be
addressed within the existing budget. In such instances, the EMC will
request, on an as needed basis, supplemental funding.
PROGRAM OUTLOOK
As the Ft 85/86 year begins, CMA and EMC are facing continuing
challenges and sme new environaental issues.

t&e public. Congress, and DA, in that vs are considered a
constructive factor on key eaviromental Issues (e.g.. Superfund,
ACM, surface water). If the chemical industry is going to continue
to be successful in its advocacy before SPA and Congress, it is
•asential, more than ever, that vs not only develop proactive
positions but provide SPA and Congress the necessary alternatives
•nd/or supporting data. In this regard, all levels of DA and
Congressional staffs continue to request industry data and/or
information as part of the Congressional and regulatory development
process.
A meaningful response by industry will require significant member
company and staff resources. If we want to effectively edvocate
positions before DA, we must continue to make this resource
camitaent. Such efforts will result in limited regulations and/or
Mrs cost-effective regulations for the chemical industry that also ,
will provide a substantially improved environment.
'The nc will be challenged during the next year to develop proectlve
positions, to rsspond to the DA, and to adequately support
legislative and judicial issues as they arise. In this regard, the

regulatory and legislative initiatives concerning groundwater, air
toxics, ACM wendsents implementation. In addition, we will need to
support OiA activities concerning possible wendments to the Clean Air
Act, and development of a new piece of groundwater legislation. There
will also be extensive regulatory activities to address on
implementation of ell environmental statutes. This activity also
includes possible litigation related to implementation of the Clean
Water Act, Clean Air Act, ACM, Safe Drinking Water Act end Superfuad.
Many environmental issues addressed at the federal level will become
■ore important at the state level and poaslbly at the international
level. The 1MC will therefore be ia e continuous process of sotting
priorities and concentrating our resources where they will have the
fastest likelihood of positive impact for the chemical industry.

Report to CMA Board of Directors
G.F. Fort, Monsanto Company
Chairman, CMA. State Affairs Committee
September 8, 198S
Good morning — I am Garth Fort from Monsanto. My purpose today
to report on the State Affairs Committee, which has the
responsibility of serving as the "watchdog for the chemical industry
j.nt rest at the state level."
This committee was formed four years age, so we're in the same
position as a politician completing his first term in office and
running for re-election on the record.
In the case of this committee, that record is a good one ....so
far.
The stakes have been high at the state level.
Congress passes major environmental legislation — the Clean.
Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Safe
Drinking Water Act, and "Superfund." But all of these are "minimum
requirements," and the states are permitted — and even encouraged —
to go farther.
Daniel Bean, writing for the "Policy Studies Journal,"
underscored the rising importance of state governments. He said,
"They are no longer regarded as horse and buggy governments, as they
were in the 1960's and are coming once again to be viewed as
laboratories of innovation and democracy.
The Conservation Foundation has pointed out that
environmentalists of a decade ago generally sought federal solutions
to pollution problems. They now look frequently to the states,
recognizing that Washington has no monopoly on "environmental virtue."
Examples are numerous. California regulations on hazardous
wastes were copied in last year's RCRA reauthorization. California
laws passed by Sher and Katz in 1983 and 1984 were models for the
present federal regulations of pits, ponds and lagoons. Very
recently, the League of Women Voters initiated a program on "Household
Hazardous wastes" focused at the local level. The effort quickly
spawned twenty bills this year at the state level, and promises to
attract the attention of U.S. EPA, if not Congress. Even today, New
Jersey state legislators are directly affecting the congressional
debate on "Community Right-to-Know and Catastrophe Prevention."
CMA 038305
Four years ago, as CMA responded to the increasing importance of
state issues, they recognized the challenges.:
- The political playing field is geographically spread over 50
states.
- There are thousands of key players — seventy-five hundred
legislators alone, with staffers and executive agency personnel
numbering thousands more.
- There are 250,000 bills introduced each year which could affect
our business.
- Timing for political action at the state level is measured in
days, not months or years, as is frequently the case in
Congress.
To meet these challenges CMA developed a unique program that is
built on sound managerial and political principles:
Set priorities on issues to make the most of limited
resources.
Get involved as early as possible in the political process to
maximize effectiveness.
Develop position statements and supporting arguments before
the issue surfaces, to keep up with the fast track political
Emphasize local involvement for early alert and political
effectiveness. Those on the scene have the best chance of
knowing what's developing and politicians listen best to
those who elect them.
To implement this program, a network of state chemical industry
councils and trade associations was chosen to be the cornerstone of
CMA's field marketing force to sell our positions on priority issues.
But it was clear that the network needed lots of support and
direction.
As Jim Murray reported last year, activities were planned to
cultivate that network by making CMA a focal point of information
m
CMA 038306
gathered from the collective national resources of our industry. Many
0f these activities are well underway, and have truly turned CMA
into a "Center of Excellence" for state issues. Member company
personnel and state trade associations are routinely turning to CMA
for advice and guidance. Other industry trade associations like
American Petroleum Institute and the National Agricultural Chemical
Association are contacting CMA on mutually important state issues.
Associations of elected officials like National Governor's
Association, National Conference of State Legislators, Council of
State Governments and even the National Association of Towns and
Townships are turning to CMA for input on policy positions, agenda
ideas and speakers. These indications of success are gratifying, but
most importantly, the "CMA approach" has clearly helped produce
"bottom line results" for member companies.
Our system was severely tested this year and it worked.
lock at some specific results:
Let's
By June of last year, community right-to-know was targeted for
priority coverage for the then upcoming 1985 legislative session.
Drawing on two years of experience with this issue at both the state
and federal levels, CMA staff efficiently pulled together a wealth of
information— position papers with back-up arguments, copies of all
previous state laws and regulations, and copies of testimony that had
been given before Congress and at the state level. In addition, CMA
State Affairs Group held regional information seminars on the subject
to educate members of the CIC's network.
when Bhopal hit in December, the CMA State Affairs organization
as a whole was well prepared for the unprecedented flood of state
hills that were promptly dumped into the legislative hopper, when the
dust settled this year over 150 bills on this subject had been
introduced in 40 states, and over 22 states passed some right-to-know
provisions. State legislators had developed new proposals to force
governmental control on our plants, and tried to move the issue far
beyond the CMA position.
Although battles are still being fought in California, New Jersey
and Michigan, to date all the laws passed this year are generally
consistent with CMA policy. We have retained our trade secret
protection rights and successfully avoided costly requirements for
unique labeling, environmental emission monitoring and independent
risk management audit3.
Public compensation was another priority issue where the results
were good. It was an active issue in five states — California,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Minnesota and Rhode Island. CMA's position
was that NO administrative public compensation program was needed and

tort law should not be changed. The CMA Policy Committee's marching
orders to the state troops in the field were clear — "Hold Pork Chop
CMA staff and member company representatives helped guide the
strategy in these states. The UAREP study results were effectively
used in conjunction with expert testimony provided by personnel from
Centers for Disease Control, academia, the insurance industry, the
legal profession, and our own companies. We were successful in four
of the five states and marginally successful in the fifth.
Only Minnesota passed a public compensation bill which
established an administrative fund — and it was very limited in
scope. The situation there was unique in that local industry
supported the legislation because it solved some severe insurability
problems created by an earlier 1983 Minnesota superfund law.
The results on another priority issue — state superfund laws —
also were good, we successfully prevented both the adoption of
unacceptable liability language and the inclusion of provisions for
personal injury compensation. State superfund fees were held within
reasonable limits, although some increased significantly.
CMA also played a role in preventing further proliferation of
unique state regulations of toxic air contaminants. As an example,
Massachusetts has been slowed down in their effort to regulate 450
compounds in six months by shortcutting good science. Reason has
prevailed despite Massachusetts' impatience with the federal
government for only promulgating regulations for six (6) hazardous
pollutants since 1970.
Progress was even made in the transportation are — CMA helped
orchestrate the passage of a couple of more "Good Samaritan" laws
bringing the total to 34 states.
CMA member companies took the lead in these cases. Our
preparation over the previous three years paid off, and our network
delivered. But we can't rest on past success. The outlook for the
future is one of increasing challenges.
Additional releases of toxic substances since Bhopal continue to
erode our privilege of self-regulation.
Instead of being innocent until proven guilty, industry now can
look forward to trying to justify its existence and its very right to
operate in the neighborhood.
CMA 038308
Cur challenge will be to prove that our operations will NOT
create a problem. The burden of proving this kind of negative is
limited only by reasonableness, as defined by state authorities whose
survival in office depends on their response to political winds.
At the same time the political climate is
policy is turning the "spotlight" on state and
issues — groundwater regulation and toxic air
will be handled primarily by the states if the
deteriorating, federal
local programs. Two
contaminants control —
when EPA announced its groundwater strategy, it was — quote —
"based on tradition deeply ingrained in our legal and institutional
history. The states have and should continue to have fundamental
responsibility for protection and management of the resource itself.."
States will be deciding when and how much industry pays for
multi-million dollar programs related to:
- Cleaning up groundwater under existing plant sites.
- Providing alternative sources of drinking water for the public.
- Requiring retrofit capital for existing facilities to ensure
better groundwater protection.
States will maintain the right to ban the use or sale of certain
ehemical products if groundwater is threatened.
The story is similar for air toxic control. On June 4, Lee
Thomas announced a substantially new approach for reducing public
health risks from airborne toxic pollutants. Federal standards for
individual contaminants will no longer be the prime tactic for control
of air toxics.
EPA plans to provide financial assistance for strengthening state
programs for control of air toxics from large point sources having
localized impacts. We will have to address the issue not in
Washington, but at the numerous locations where problems are felt to
exist. No longer will states have to wait for U.S. EPA to act before
they can require new emission controls on "toxics," Tens, if not
hundreds, of millions of dollars for additional emission controls are
at stake.

SUFEPFUMD
Some have estimated that by 1990 total state superfund program
costs will exceed those of CERCLA as states tackle more abandoned
sites not on the National Priority List and pay more for long-term
sits maintenance.
RIGHT-TO-KNOW
Our opponents will push for what they did not get this year —
emission monitoring and independent audits of our plant safety
programs.
PUBLIC COMPENSATION
Minnesota's action this year will cause some states to play
catch-up. In addition, plaintiff lawyers will continue to push to
reduce "burden of proof” for chronic health cases. Their carrot is
hundreds of millions of dollars of court settlements.
HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL PRACTICES
The push to phase out landfills and deep wells will continue.
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE TRANSPORTATION ISSUE
Post-Bhopal analysis of risks will focus on transportation of
hazardous materials. Routing restrictions and additional fees will be
considered.
Cur planning conference in June identified these as priority
issues and we have established some specific objectives to improve our
effectiveness in tackling them:
- Expand our computerized early alert and information network to
improve staff productivity.
- Setter use of public relations or advocacy communication at
state level.
- Establish two-way "electronic mail" capabilities with key
chemical industry councils to better meet their needs.
Our action plans for next year remain consistent with the
original premise of the CMA State Affairs Program. Basically, we
target to do what we do better.

Last year, Jim Murray stood before you to ask for additional CMA
staff support for the state program. You responded, and I think the
results speak for themselves*. The team has performed. On behalf of
everyone who was out there in the trenches, I want to borrow a slogan
used by the United Way a cogple of years age, and say — "Thanks to
We have built a national network that is stronger than any one of
us could have done on our own. By leveraging our position, we have
produced very good returns on our rather limited investment.
The CMA State Affairs effort needs your continued support next
year in four basic areas:
Maintain CMA staff support at the same level as last year.
Provide additional active member company personnel to serve
on state CMA task groups established for the priority issues.
Support state trade associations and chemical industry
councils with dues and experienced people. Bill wood
will expand on this request in his presentation, which
follows.
Involve senior chemical industry executives in state matters
with follow up provided by local personnel.
With your continued support in these areas, CMA State Affairs
Committee should do an even better job next year as the "watchdog for
our industry at the state level."

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
STATE CHEMICAL ORGANIZATIONS STATUS REPORT
BACKGROUND
During the past several years, there has been increasing interest in the
status, programs and collective capabilities of the various organizations
representing the chemical industry at the state level. These organizations
include state chemical associations, state chemical Industry councils (CICs)
and chemical industry committees of state manufacturers associations. In
addition, there has also been interest expressed concerning how the evolving
state and local Involvement of CMA fits with the existing programs, prior­
ities and capabilities of the state organizations.
FORMATION OE WORK GROUP
To meet this need, an ad hoc work group was assembled, composed of
member company state and public affairs professionals who both individually
and through the corporations they represent had played a key role in the
development and evolution of state organizations around the country.
OBJECTIVES
The work group identified the following objectives for this report:
Prepare a comprehensive status report on the current
objectives, structure, finances, programs, plans and needs of
the various state organizations,
Assess the collective current resources and capabilities of
the 18 state organizations.
. Draw some conclusions about the overall operation of the state
groups, identifying particularly those elements which make
successful CIC programs successful and those elements which
inhibit success.
Develop and communicate recommendations for both CMA and
member company actions relative to improving and supporting
the state organizations and their existing missions.
The following were clearly not the objectives of the report:
Evaluate or judge the performance of any individual state
organization.
Assess or develop an overall CMA program for expanded
Involvement at the state and local level. This could follow,
however, based on this group's report and utilizing a
broader-based range of Interest and expertise.
CMA 038312
2
PERSONAL SURVEY OF STATE ORGANIZATIONS
In order to carry out its objectives, the group developed a survey which
sought information and opinion from and about each organization in the
following areas: organization (including structure, funding, staffing and
member participation), issue coverage, advocacy programs (legislative,
regulatory, public/media communications, education, grassroots, etc), commu­
nications and image-building activities, and future plans and needs, the
group personally interviewed a range of individuals in each state to seek
their input, and this material was then compiled and analyzed by the work
group. Summaries of the state surveys are contained in the full report and
are presented in chart form following this Executive Summary.
CONCLUSION FROM SURVEY
Organizational Classification. The 18 state organizations may
be classified into four organizational categories:
Needs for CICs. In states of primary importance, the chemical
industry needs to have a network of strong CICs (either independent
or affiliated with other state business associations) with multiple
capabilities to achieve not only the primary goal in each state
which is minimizing inappropriate legislation, but also the
national goals of the chemical industry as well which include:
Independent, with an all volunteer effort.
(Alabama and
Delaware)
Independent, largely volunteer, but with a part-time staff,
consultant and/or lobbyist.
(Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan-,
Illinois, Missouri)
Affiliated with state trade association, utilizing principally
trade association staff, but may have own part-time staff,
consultant, or lobbyist.
(New York, Connecticut, Ohio,
Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Massachusetts)
Independent with one or more full-time staff members, together
with a multi-committee structure responsible for individual
programs.
(Texas, Louisiana, New Jersey, California).
Uniformity in state legislation/regulation
Avoidance of bad precedents for Federal legislation
Support for Federal Grassroots Program
Support for Regional Communications efforts on national issues
Support for CAER/NCRIC programs and any other industry
initiatives which require local implementation or support
Programs and Capabilities. Collectively, the 18 state groups
represent a broad spectrum of programs and capabilities. While a
few can be deemed fully functional organizations with multifaceted
programs, many are still seeking their identity or are otherwise in
a state of transition or growth. It is also important to point out
that many still see their role restricted almost entirely to direct
legislative and regulatory advocacy. Much progress has been made
in the last five years, and more will follow with the proper
leadership, member company commitment and the allocation of
sufficient resources.
CMA 038313
3
Budget and Finances. The budgets and dues structures of the
various state organizations varies enormously from state-to-state,
with the budget range being from $0 to over $500,000. This variance
can be somewhat misleading since 7 groups operate affiliated with
state manufacturers associations to whom they pay dues separately.
However, it is accurate to say that with the exception of four
states (Texas, Louisiana, New Jersey and California), the rest of
the state organizations generally operate on budgets of well under
$100,000 per year. The bulk of the resources are not provided by
direct dues, but are contributed in the form of member company
personnel and expertise. Dues are generally based on a flat fee,
plus surcharges for additional facilities and number of employees.
Elements which Contribute to Successful CIC Programs.
following were identified:
The
Strong commitment by senior management of major companies with
the largest in-state presence and resources.
Broad participation by chemical Industry companies represented
in that state with human as well as financial resources com­
mitted to the program.
Strong qualitative and quantitative CIC staff support - full
or part-time lobbyist, executive director or-manufacturers
association staff located in the State Capitol.
Member company support of an equitable fee structure which
generates sufficient revenue to operate a meaningful program.
Strong programs do not seem to be seriously affected by
economic downturns.
Focus on strong legislative or leglslatlve/regulatory programs
with the goal being to make a meaningful Impact on the public
policy process.
Recognition of the CIC as the prime resource on "our issues”.
Strong working relationship with CMA and other key allied
industries and the ability to deal effectively with the
opposition.
Member company satisfaction and the degree to which they feel
they are being adequately represented in the legislative
process.
Where appropriate, strong affiliation with the state manufac­
turers association.
Access to political action committee resources
Strong grassroots program (ACIT).
Elements which Prevent CIC Programs from being Fully
Effective. The following elements were identified as factors which
may prevent individual programs from being fully effective:
Lack of sufficient chemical industry representation in the
state.
Lack of commitment by key in-state companies.
Lack of technical expertise/specialized resources being made
available,
Geographic spread of members in the state - difficulty in
getting to capital easily/frequently.
CMA 038314
4
Lack of adequate funding or an otherwise flawed dues system
which lacks member support.
Lack of strong retained leadership/staff services.
Lack of agreement on common/priorlty goals and effective ways
to meet those goals.
Negative media/image of the industry in the state.
Inability to network or work with other business organizations
and CMA.
Credibility and militancy of the "other side" in the state.
COMPARISON WITH OTHER MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES' STATE PROGRAMS.
The CMA/CIC Network approach was compared and contrasted to the
programs operated by the tobacco industry and the petroleum Industry.
The CMA/CIC program was determined to be Increasingly effective at a
cost of about one-eighth of the API or Tobacco Institute approach of a
large centralized program.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations for CMA and its member companies were
developed based upon the survey, interviews and work group discussions.
These recommendations are designed to enhance the state chemical
organizations' ability to carry out their present missions, the primary
(and in some cases exclusive) one being state legislative and regulatory
advocacy. To the extent the industry's priorities for these
organizations change or significantly evolve, a further examination and
some additional actions and recommendations will be required.
CMA Actions
Under current circumstances, the nature of the organizational
relationship between CMA and the individual state chemical
organizations should remain as it is, rather than move toward
the API approach of integrated state petroleum councils funded
and staffed directly by the national organization.
CMA priorities should be on strengthening existing CICs rather
than creating new ones at this time. CMA should carefully
consider how the Industry should be collectively represented
in those states without CICs and where there is a distinct
chemical Industry issue which will not be adequately addressed
otherwise. Specifically, should resources be made available
to have a CMA state lobbyist on a retained basis where
circumstances warrant?
CMA should allocate funds to help finance specific projects or
operations of state chemical councils on a seed money/matching
grant program to assist in getting new or expanded operations
going. Such grants for projects or expanded operations should be
for a limited time and made under specific criteria and standards.
CMA 038315
5
The focus of such CMA funding should be on supporting those
programs and priorities of the chemical industry which are of
interstate and national significance. Funding for ongoing
programs and for issues and projects primarily of intrastate
Interest should continue to be funded directly by the member
companies of each state organization. Similar funds currently
provided through the CMA communication program to help initiate
issue-oriented communication projects at the state level also
have value and should be continued.
CMA should continue and renew its efforts to build a stronger
overall relationship between CMA and the individual CICs so
that CMA and the CICs can better utilize each other's capabil­
ities. Specifically, CMA should;
Increase its efforts to provide technical/scientific/
legal support to the CICs on the state aspects of key
chemical Industry Issues.
Continue to devote adequate resources to its ongoing
Internal state affairs and communications programs which
provide direct support to state CIC efforts.
Provide continuing support to increase membership and
active participation in the CICs and should continue to
seek ways to Increase the visibility of the efforts of
the CICs with senior management.
Continue efforts in working with other national business
associations on state level cooperation and coordination.
Examine options for developing more equitable and uniform
methods for funding CIC operations.
Fund and conduct leadership and training workshops for
CIC staff and key member company volunteers in leadership
positions in the CICs.
Member Company Actions
Top down corporate involvement by senior chemical industry
executives in state government affairs generally and in CIC
activities specifically. They need to make effective CICs a
priority in their organizations by:
Joining where they manufacture or otherwise
have an Interest
Providing adequate financial resources
Providing the right kind of people to support
the effort
Making corporate technical resources available
Top down personal support and Involvement by senior chemical
Industry executives in state matters, particularly legislative
CMA 038316
6
advocacy. Individuals In aach corporation naad to selectively
lnvolva senior executives In these Issues. This will Increase
corporate awareness of the serious nature of the state Issues
and will also Increase changes for legislative success.
Member companies should assign an Individual overall respon­
sibility for State Affairs for the corporation.
Member companies should bring CIO staff/leaders to corporate
headquarters for briefings on key state Issues.
Action Required
Member companies should consider Individual actions based upon the
member company recommendations in the report. CMA should evaluate
the individual CMA recommendations In the context of Its 1985/86
budget and program review process.

ADMINISTRATION'S 1985 TAX REFORM PROPOSAL
REPORT ON CMA POSITIONS AND ACTIONS
BACKQtOUND?
On May 28, President Reagan announced his 198S tax reform
program.
In general, the President's program would shift almost $40
billion of the Federal income tax burden now borne by individuals to
business taxpayers. Within the business sector, the President's
program would substantially increase the tax burden of businesses that
are capital intensive and that engage in significant international
trade. Although the impact of specific provisions may vary from
company to company, the overall impact of the President's tax program
would cost the chemical industry more than $2.5 billion annually.
The President's program provides for a reduction in the maximtan
corporate tax rate from 46 to 33 percent. In addition, it provides
for a deduction in computing corporate income taxes of 10 percent of
dividends paid. Offsetting these reductions, the President's plan
would repeal the investment tax credit, replace the ACRS depreciation
system with a less favorable capital cost recovery system, and replace
the present minimum tax with a new minimum tax on corporate income.
Beginning in 1986, significant new recapture rules would apply to
taxpayers who took depreciation deductions of $400,000 or more in the
period January 1, 1980 through July 1, 1986. Under these new rules,
40 percent of the excess depreciation claimed for tax purposes over
that allowed for earnings and profits (less a $300,000 overall
.deduction) would be recaptured at post-1985 corporate tax rates.
Thus, capital intensive taxpayers who used the incentives for capital
formation in President Reagan's 1981 tax program would be subject to
significant tax increases over the next three calendar years.
The President's tax program also proposes significant changes in
the taxation of international activities of U.S. corporations. The
program would impose a more restrictive per country limitation on the
use of the foreign tax credit and would eliminate the old and
established "title passage" test for detesnining the source of income
from the sale of property, including the export of manufactured
products. The proposal includes stringent new rules on the allocation
of interest expenses among within the members of a consolidated group.
Significant reductions in tax benefits are also provided for
activities in U.S. possessions, notably Puerto Rico.
In general, Democratic and Republican Congressional leaders have
supported the broad objective to pass tax reform legislation this
year. The Administration and Congressional leaders have also agreed,
for the moment, that the objectives of tax refonn should be
accomplished in legislation that neither increases nor decreases the
flow of tax revenues to the Federal Government.
CMA PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND RESPONSE
In November, 1984, the Tax Policy Cpmmittee identified several
major tax issues that are of continuing concern to the chemical
industry. Subsequently, the Treasury Department proposed major tax
reforms that would affect many of these subjects.
At the Board's January meeting. Committee Chairman William M.
Bellamy, Jr. reported that the Tax Policy Committee was developing a
series of specific issue responses to the Treasury's tax reform
proposals that could be incorporated into a CMA legislative statement.
In May, Mr. Bellamy delivered a progress report to the Executive
Cowaittee and noted that the Tax Policy Coanittee would request that
CMA commission independent studies for use in CMA's tax legislative
program.
CMA commissioned Price-Waterhouse to conduct a study of effective
tax rates in the ehmsical industry. Also, CMA provided a grant to the
Institute for Research in the Economics of Taxation (IRET) to study
the impact of selected tax refon proposals on the formation of
capital in the chemical industry. In July, the Tax policy Coanittee
developed a CMA legislative statement on the Administration's tax
program vftiich was presented to the House Committee on Ways and Means
by Dexter F. Baker, President, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. At
its August 13 and 14, 198S meetings, the Tax Policy Committee and QIC
Tax Legislative Task Group established priorities with respect to
major tax issues of chemical industry concern and approved in concept
its plan for legislative action.
Attached is a brief summary of CMA's position on tax reform
legislation.

superfund status report
Legislative Review
By Walls Denyes, Eastman Kodak Company
House Energy and Commerce Committee/ on July 26, reported the Superfund
H.R. 2317. The bill was approved by a vote of 31 to 10, with one member
Noting- This vote occurred after six long days that included many emotional
"Abates on the issues. The substance of the original bi-partisan compromise bill
3
retained. The bill as reported has been judged by CMA's technical groups to
wa reasonable, although it substantially increased the programs and authority over
preset law.
Following is a brief list of key issues that were considered and the votes
which major and damaging changes were rejected:
Mandatory clean up schedules.
Far more stringent standards of clean up, even greater than might
be needed to protect health and the environment.
Requirement that private-party clean ups be more stringent than
fund-financed clean ups.
Requiring that all clean up settlements contain a reopener clause
thus preventing final release from liability to be granted.
Remove limits of liability and create joint and several liability in
the Leaking Underground Storage Tanks Program.
Expand the rights of citizens to bring suit against owners of waste
disposal sites in Federal court if there may be an iminent or
substantial endangerment.
Creation of a Hazardous Substance inventory as part of the Community
Right-to-Know provision.
In the House, Superfund debate now moves to the House Public works and
Transportation Committee. Subcommittee Chairman Robert Row (D-NJ) has had
the staff working through the August recess preparing for early September markup.
Environmentalists have been urging the committee to begin debate using the
original Florio bill, which was rejected by the Energy and Commerce Committee.
TMA has recommended the Committee begin from H.R. 2817.
The House Ways and Means Committee has tentatively scheduled markup for
e&rLy September. In addition, both the House Judiciary Cosanittee and the
Merchant Marine and Fisheries Counittee have been granted jurisdiction of the
^U. This means that five major committees of the House will have considered
auperfund before it goes to the Rules Counittee and it is brought to the House
•door, as a result, final passage is unlikely before September 30 and thus some
CMA 038323
lapse may wall occur in the taxing authority. A 30 or 60-day dalay should enable
Congress to complete final action before the end of this year.
in the Senate, the Superfund bill, S. SI, was not brought to the floor before
the August recess began as had been predicted. Delays occurred principally
because Senators Domenici (R-NM) and Simpson (R-WY) wanted
to perfect
amendments dealing with liability and insurance issues. These and a host of other
amendments are expected to be considered while Superfund is on the Senate floor in
September.

ADVOCACY OVERVIEW
Congress
The President's offensive to hold the line on federal spending, fend
off tax increases and quell the demand for trade protection will probably
result in a number of vetoes this fall. Aides have reportedly begun
laying the groundwork for possible confrontation with Congress over
spending bills "in order to protect the economy."
After a lengthy debate, House and Senate conferees reached agreement
on the first Budget Resolution for FY 1986, later adopted by the full
House and Senate the same day. It would reduce the fiscal 1986 deficit by
$57.5 billion. The agreement exceeds the $50 billion set by the
Administration and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, who
testified that this amount in deficit reduction in FY 86 would be
necessary to keep interest rates from rising.
A Cabinet shakeout appears likely to kicked off by the departure of
Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler, possibly being
replaced by Jack Svahn, the White House domestic policy chief. Another
Cabinet member said to be targeted for replacement is Agriculture
Secretary John Block. In the aftermath of President Reagan's surgery for
cancer, White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan has been presiding
over Cabinet meetings before the President arrives to sit in.
The President will make trips out of town three or four days a month
to promote his tax reform plan and to stump for Republican candidates
facing reelection.
When Congress returns from its August recess much attention will be
focussed on trade. The protectionist legislation proposed thus far is
directed chiefly against the Japanese, while the trade deficit with Canada
and Europe is growing at a increased rate.
The Congressional adjournment date is uncertain, with several
important issues on the agenda, including appropriations bills, the Farm
bill, highway construction, budget reconciliation and Superfund.
Federal Regulatory Agencies
Environmental Protection Agency
Recently settled enforcement cases dramatize EPA's increased emphasis
on rigorous enforcement of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
Page

CMA 038326
Although EPA has been inspecting for compliance with all sections of TSCA,
the largest fines have been levied for violations of the premanufacture
notice and reporting provisions of TSCA. In one recent settlement, a
substantial fine was reduced because the company voluntarily disclosed the
violations and agreed to perform a company-wide audit for compliance with
TSCA.
Since late June, EPA has been preparing a list of hazardous
substances that it believes should be stringently controlled. Draft lists
have ranged from 50 to 700 chemicals, depending on EPA's selection
criteria. The list, expected to be published during September, will
probably cover 100-200 substances, which will be the targets of EPA and
OSHA inspections.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
On May 30, 1985, FERC moved to stimulate competition in natural gas
markets by publishing a rule. Some parts of the rule are objectionable,
but overall it could improve access to reserves from the outer continental
shelf.
Occupational Safety & Health Administration
OSHA's new draft instruction (CPL 2.65) to Field Officers will
establish a National Pilot Program for inspecting chemical plant
processes. Field Officers are now being trained to conduct process safety
inspections.
Department of Transportation
Senior officials in the Department of Transportation are considering
recommending that the U.S. not continue its talks with the Consultation
Shipping Group (CSG) of developed countries regarding a formal agreement
to oppose cargo reservation. CMA favors continuation of the talks leading
to a formal agreement, and is advocating its support to DOT and the other
Executive Branch departments and agencies involved in the decision.
International
The Congress is increasingly angry about the ever worsening trade
situation, but frustrated in finding a solution. The Representative
Gibbons (H.R. 2451) bill dealing with the use of natural resources is
strongly opposed by the Administration and parts of the business
community. The legislative proposal by Representative Rostenkowski (H.R.
3035) to impose a 25 percent surcharge on imports has gained many
supporters but is considered to be too extreme. The many anti-Japanese
proposals are bolstered by the probable $50 billion trade deficit with
that country. These measures seem too much a departure from traditional
U.S. trade policy for the lawmakers. Meanwhile, the Administration is
forced to deal with the myriad import problems on an industry by industry
basis with remedies available in present law.
Page

CMA 038327
The U.S. continues to promote a new GATT round of tariff and non­
tariff bargaining, it is winning support in Europe and with other
countries. The Congress is reluctant but does not yet have the
Administration's request for authority to proceed. This is predicted to
come yet this fall with negotiations proposed to start in 1986. CMA is
preparing its policy recommendations for the legislative process and for
the negotiation phase.
The expected U.S. trade deficit of 5150 billion in 1985 is lamented
by everyone but no real solution is yet in sight. The slight decline of
the dollar has raised some hopes for an early end to the trade problem.
The dollar must drop much further down to make a difference and it will
take many months after the drop to become a significant trade factor.
States
In 1985, the National Conference of State Legislatures polled more
than 300 legislative leaders and legislative research directors asking
what were the key issues challenging the 50 state legislatures. Budget
and tax concerns ranked as the top issues for virtually every legislative
agenda. Some states face tight budgets and are searching for new
revenues. Others are considering the allocation of budget surpluses, tax
reform and tax cuts.
In the natural resources area, the survey cited hazardous wastes as a
top concern for state legislatures. Issues they expect to address include
identification of disposal sites, transportation of materials, regulation
of generators and clean-up efforts.
At a time when federal aid to the states is diminishing and economic
pressures force austerity, state legislatures have worked to meet special
program needs such as education and health care. While the financial
industry is undergoing dramatic technological changes, legislatures are
reshaping their regulatory structures and proposing statutes that
recognize the shifting geographic boundaries of financial institutions.
Many problems remain and major reform efforts may undergo further change
in the coming years.
Media
The media have been focusing increasingly sophisticated attention on
public health and safety matters. This concentration has been growing
since before Bhopal and the recent accidental release at Institute, West
Virginia.
According to researchers the media has been developing the theme of
"corporate acts as the driving force in American society." The up side is
that the public sees business as the problem solver of choice. The down
side is the media loves to find feet of clay on the public's heroes.
Corporate governance issues have been among the top five covered by
the national media. Unlike acute stories such as the Institute release,
Page
3
CMA 038328
Reagan's health, airline accidents -- which may surge to higher levels in
the top five — attention to governance has remained steady over six to
eight months.
The media have identified a growing separation between "grassroots
activists" — such Lois Gibbs' Clearinghouse on Hazardous Waste, the
National Coalition Against Toxic Waste, Ralph Nader's Public Interest
Research Groups (PIRGs) and Greenpeace — and the so-called gang of 10 —
NRDC, Sierra Club, Wildlife, Audubon, Friends of the Earth, etc.
The "gang's" new manifesto, An Environmental Agenda for the Future,
includes issues such as population control, trade policy, nuclear war and
world hunger.
Activists say the traditional groups are becoming irrelevant to
domestic environmental questions and have lost touch with the proven,
time-tested confrontational approach to relationships with government and
business. Recent accidents and incidents have strengthened the
confrontational hand and could give the traditionalists second thoughts
about their recent moves toward more business-like leadership and
cooperative approaches.
II. ISSUES AND PROGRAM STATUS
SUPERFUND
(CERCLA and Old Waste Site Cleanup)
Congressional Developments and Response
Senate Activity. The Senate Finance Coranittee has completed action
and reported to the Senate floor a funding level and mechanism to S. 51,
Superfund reauthorization. They approved freezing the current feedstock
tax and imposing a Superfund excise tax (SET) on manufacturing. SET would
apply to sales of tangible personal property by the person who
manufactured or produced the property. The funding level is $7.5 billion
for the next 5 years with $300 million from feedstocks taxes and $1.2
billion from SET per year. Also, the committee deleted general revenues
from S. 51, mainly to deny funding for the victim assistance demonstration
program.
The Senate Judiciary Committee, which was granted sequential referral
of the referral of the bill, failed to make changes during their referral
time period. Thus members of the Judiciary Committee may offer amendments
on Superfund liability and settlements issues.
Senate floor action is expected to occur in September and number of
amendments will be offered. Of concern to CMA would be amendments to
alter the Finance Committee funding mechanism, that would expand the
conmunity right-to-know provisions and that would add general revenue to
fund the victims assistance demonstration program. Also it is expected
that Senator Robert Stafford (R-CT) will offer am amendment for he the
insurance industry. It would eliminate insurance policy to coverage prior
Rage
4
CMA 038329
r
to 1980 for waste site cleanups and for insurance policies written after
1980 they would specifically state that waste cleanup is covered.
House Activity. The Energy and Commerce Committee reported Superfund
reauthorization legislation, H.R. 2817, on July 25, The legislation
represents support of a bi-partisan coalition led by Representatives John
Dingell (D-MI), Dennis Eckart (D-OH) and Norman Lent (R-NY). Voting
against reporting H.R. 2817 were Representatives James Florio (D-NJ),
Henry Waxman (D-CA) and 8 other committee Democrats.
The legislation focuses primarily on cleaning up inactive hazardous
waste and sites except in an emergency, gives EPA discretion in cleaning
up each site, grants states new authority, requires health assessment at
NPL sites and creates a community right-to-know.
The Public Works s Transportation Committee has completed hearings on
Superfund and will begin mark-up in September. CMA testified twice before
the Water Resources Subcommittee on the Superfund reauthorization issues
and community right-to-know. The Judiciary Committee held two days of
hearings on the settlement and enforcement issues and CMA testified. They
will only have jurisdiction for a short time in September.
The Ways & Mews Committee is not expected to schedule Superfund for
consideration until after the other committees complete action.
Representative Jim Jones (D-OK) has recently introduced the Senate Finance
Committee's Superfund funding package, H.R. 3030. This means it is
unlikely that a House-Senate conference can occur and a bill signed into
law before the taxing authority expires on September 30.
The Superfund Task Group of CMA's Government Relations Committee
continues to advocate CMA's position on both the funding portion and the
programmatic portion of the Superfund issues. The chemical industry's
concern over substantial increase in feedstock taxes is being heard in
- Congress and the probability of encountering positive increases in the
feedstock tax appears to be diminishing. Much more discussion has
developed in Congress about the possible need for some new broad-based
tax. Both of these points were emphasized in the introduction of other
bills in both the House and the Senate. But, an industry coalition has
formed to fight against the enactment in Superfund of a broad-based tax,
including the Finance Cosnittees Superfund excise tax. CMA also continues
to work actively with other industry trade associations to develop
broad-based support for many of the issues.
2. Grassroots Activities
The Grassroots Program continues to respond to the changing
legislative status of the Superfund reauthorization. During early 1985,
most grassroots activity was targeted to Members of the Energy and
Commerce Committee. Those efforts were apparent in the final Energy and
Commerce Committee vote to report H.R. 2817. Of the fourteen Democrats
who voted to report H.R. 2817, eleven had been targeted by the Grassroots
program. Only two targeted Congressmen voted against reporting H.R. 2817.
All seven Republicans who had been targeted voted to report H.R. 2817.
In total, eighteen out of the twenty members who had been targeted by

The Grassroots Program is now concentrating on the House Ways and
Means Committee in addition to a few specific House Public works and
Transportation Committee targets. All companies participating in the
Grassroots Program have been contacted requesting letters and plantmanager visits during August to all Members of these Committees.
In addition to Superfund activities, the CMA Government Relations
Committee's Grassroots Task Group has established goals for the remainder
of 1985 and 1986.
These goals are as follows:
Goal 1:
Identify the issue or issues which will be the primary focal point
for the grassroots program.
(This will be recomnended by the
Government Relations Committee and approved by CMA's Board of
Directors.)
Goal 2:
Determine what grassroots organization is best suited to influence
the new issue or issues.
Goal 3:
Strengthen the grassroots structure and improve participation of Task
Group Members, Grassroots Managers (GRMs), and Congressional Liaison
Representatives (CLRs).
- Determine specific responsibilities of GRMs and CLRs.
- Broaden responsibilities of Task Group.
- Improve communications on issue/issues and results.
- Encourage more initiative.
Goal 4:
Conduct more training.
- Bring GRMs and/or CLRs to Washington to launch new issues,
set goals, and conduct training (November 12, 1985}.
- The Task Group Chairman, Task Group members and the CMA staff
executive to provide on-site training to GRMs and CLRs.
Goal 5:
Establish targets and time frames relative to grassroots efforts on
next issue or issues.
Regulatory Developments and Response
Draft Superfund Health Assessment Manual. The Superfund
Implementation Task Group developed informal comments on EPA's draft
Superfund Health Assessment Manual. The manual will be used by EPA
personnel to guide the Agency's actions at site cleanups. Although
generally supportive of the draft document, CMA's comments recommended
several points to help improve the final EPA work product.
Draft EPA Guidance Document for Providing Alternative water Supplies.
The Superfund Implementation Task Group developed informal comments on
EPA's draft guidance on providing alternative water supplies. The
Page
7
CMA 038332
guidance manual will be used by EPA personnel to assist in Superfund site
cleanup activities. CMA's informal comments were designed to correct
substantive problems observed in the draft guidance document.
Communications
in a three month period, June through August, 84 national and
regional media briefings have been completed by CMA/metnber company teams.
That amounts to more calls than were completed in six months in 1984.
The editorial board response has again been positive with balanced
editorial treatment in the key national press — the New York Times, wall
Street Journal and the Washington Post — as well as leading regional
newspapers.
In addition to national releases special materials were targeted to
specific states and districts. This localized material (Texas impact for
Texas, etc.) went to 30 major market areas.
A new, and very successful approach, was for CMA to serve as an
alternative network for distribution of information not covered by the
commercial networks.
Thirteen Congressmen, fearing that reauthorization was in danger,
crafted a compromise. Major national special interest groups immediately
attacked the members in their districts for straying from a hard line.
CMA filmed the members' press conference; supplied same day
television coverage to stations in their districts; surveyed usage and
compiled a report; supplied the members with copies of the materials and
records of use in their districts.
New areas are being targeted for Superfund media tours as Congress
returns in September.
Public Compensation
Congressional Developments and Response
Product Liability. Senator John Danforth (R-MO), Chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, has released a new staff working draft of
product liability legislation. This effort is designed to break current
deadlock on product liability legislation. The deadlock emerged in May
when a motion to report Senator Robert Kasten's bill failed on an eight to
eight vote.
The staff draft combines uniform federal product liability standards
— the focus of the Kasten bill — with a new alternative claim system.
This system provides an injured party with an alternative to litigation.
Anyone harmed by a product could submit an expedited claim for a limited
range of damages to the manufacturer. A manufacturer who pays these
damages or declines to pay a claim solely ^because of a dispute over the
Page
8
CMA 038333
amount of damages may not be sued for damages arising out of the same
harm. CMA intends to submit its views on the draft to Senator Danforth.
ujjite Handling and Disposal
Regulatory Developments and Response
Streamlining State RCRA Revisions. The RCRA Regulations Task Group
developed comments on EPA's proposed regulations to streamline state
revisions. CMA's comments supported EPA's regulatory reform proposals
that procedurally simplify the rulemaking process.
Draft Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). The
Environmental Monitoring Task Group developed informal comments on EPA's
TCLP methodology. The TCLP will be used by EPA for determining whether
certain substances are hazardous under RCRA. CMA's comments identified
technical and scientific problems with the methodology as it is presently
set forth. The task group is working with EPA and other trade groups to
refine the methodology so that it meets EPA's and industry's needs.
Technical and Research Activities
Solid Waste Technology Workshop. The Solid Waste Technology Task
Group sponsored a workshop for solid waste experts. The workshop, attended
by 40 member company representatives, provided an opportunity to discuss
common problems and exchange ideas on solid waste technology matters.
Xnterassociatlon TCLP Research Project. The Environmental Management
Committee approved participation in an interassociation project to study
EPA's TCLP methods to verify the precision and accuracy of the procedures,
v Other organizations participating in the project are the American Iron and
Steel Institute, American Mining Congress, American Textile Manufacturers
Institute, Edison Electric Institute, and American Lead Industry. The
goal of the project is to provide data and information that will result in
revisions to the TCLP methods.
Waste Minimization Guidance. The RCRA Regulations Task Group
developed a guidance document offering member companies recommendations on
how to comply with the new RCRA waste minimization certification
provisions. The document, rather than stating one way to comply, offers
member companies options to be considered in developing a plan to comply
with the requirements that take effect in November 1985.
Litigation and Related Activities
Definition of Solid Waste. On April 4, 1985, CMA moved to intervene
in American Mining Congress v. Environmental Protection Agency, No.
85-1206 (D.C. Cir.) This case involves a challenge to EPA's new
definition of solid waste, published as a final rule on January 4, 1985.
CMA's motion to intervene has been granted.
CMA became involved in this case for two reasons. First, CMA has
teen closely associated with' the development of the new definition of
Page
CM* 038334
solid waste and therefore was interested in continuing this involvement
to assure that our members' interests are protected, in addition, the
final rule has deviated from the proposal in one significant respect: it
brings within the definition of solid waste on-site reclamation activities
that are a part of a chemical process. As a result, CMA members may be
faced with having to apply for RCRA permits for many hundreds of
reclamation processes and associated storage tanks. CMA has met with EPA
to determine whether alternative regulatory schemes can be developed that
will address EPA's concerns while excluding these operations which are
clearly a part of chemical processes.
Communications
"Cleaning Up", the new waste site cleanup film, has been completed
and is in distribution. The film is intended to demonstrate the progress
being made in cleanup and features a roundtable discussion between Lee
Thomas, EPA administrator. Bill Reilly, Conservation Foundation, Chuck
Powers, Clean Sites Inc., Penny Newman, California environmental activist
and Tom Heilman, former EMC chairman.
Initial distribution will be in 13 key "chemical” production states
to commercial, cable and educational television stations and adult commu­
nity groups. The community information task group of the Communications
Coimnittee is active in placing the program.
In addition member companies are using the film for internal
audiences. With promotion just beginning, more than 50 films and tapes
have been sold and 60 are being previewed.
Safe Drinking Water/Groundwater
Congressional Developments and Response
Safe Drinking Water
Senate Activity. The Senate bill, S. 124, introduced by Sen. David
Durenberger (R-MN), amends the Safe Drinking Water Act. The bill focuses
on setting drinking water standards and regulating public water systems.
CMA generally supports S. 124, believing most of our concerns have been
addressed. We particularly support the decision not to include
comprehensive groundwater protection provisions. The bill passed the
Senate by voice vote May 16.
House Activity. The House bill, H.R. 1650, introduced by Rep.
Madigan (R-IL) passed the House by voice vote June 17. The bill differs
from the Senate bill in two key areas: standard-setting and groundwater
protection.
it looks as though the SDWA Conference will not take place until
September. Although Congressional staff predict that the conference will
go smoothly, there may be controversy over groundwater protection - a
state groundwater planning program in the House bill (H.R. 1650) that is
absent from the Senate bill. The Senate conferees are opposed to major
Page
10
CMA 038335
groundwater protection provisions in the SDW reauthorization. Senator
Durenberger wants separate federal legislation to protect groundwater and
expects to introduce a bill in the fall (see groundwater section).
In addition the bills differ in standard setting, judicial review and
authorization levels, but Hill staffers expect compromise on these
issues.
CMA will be supporting the Senate bill over the House bill on three
issues: standard setting, no comprehensive groundwater protection
program, and the Senate critical aquifer demonstration program instead of
the House sole source.
Groundwater
Senator Oave Durenberger (R-MN) has held three hearings as he pre­
pares to introduce his groundwater protection bill this fall.
The first two hearings, held on June 17 and 20 were on groundwater
quality and quantity, contamination and policy issues, and state efforts.
The third hearing, focused on EPA's groundwater protection strategy, which
calls for EPA to provide financial assistance to the states. Additional
hearings will be held in Washington in September and October, which is
when CMA will testify. Senator Durenberger plans on circulating a draft
bill for comment in September.
2. Technical and Research Activities
Application of Risk Analysis to Groundwater Issues. The Risk
Assessment Task Group conducted a review of the application of risk
analysis concepts to groundwater issues. The review focused previous work
in developing risk analysis methods on the specific problems associated
with groundwater contamination. Future activity will identify the
application of risk analysis methods to establish acceptable exposure
levels to substances found in groundwater.
Definition of Key Groundwater Terms. The Groundwater Management Task
Group developed a glossary of definitions of key groundwater terms.
The definitions will assure consistent use of key terms in all CMA
groundwater work products.
Groundwater Containment and Treatment Technologies. The Water
Technology Task Group developed a summary of existing groundwater
containment and treatment technologies. The summary is available to
member companies and CICs for their use in addressing groundwater
matters.
Alternate Supplies of Drinking Water. The Groundwater Task Group
developed a paper on alternate supplies of drinking water where
contamination exists. This paper is an elaboration of a previously
approved Superfund position on alternate supplies of drinking water. The
work product will be used by the State Affairs Committee in addressing
state groundwater legislative matters.

CMA 038336
Underground Injection Control Project. Seventeen companies have
agreed to participate in a specially funded activity addressing potential
bans under RCRA of the underground injection of hazardous wastes. The
group includes CMA members and other companies that use underground
injection as a disposal mechanism for a manufacturing facility. The
primary objective of the group is to develop relevant technical data and
information for submittal to EPA in order to impact on EPA's regulatory
decision making process.
Communications
A committee task group has completed a communication and media
relations plan for groundwater advocacy.
Government Control of Chemical Production/Innovation (TSCA)
Regulatory Developments and Response
Comprehensive Reporting. On July 17 and 30, EPA held public meetings
to review a draft reporting rule that EPA plans to develop but has not yet
formally proposed. EPA would issue the comprehensive reporting rule under
the authority of Section 8(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
The rule would establish an extensive list of questions and Agency
procedures for making chemicals subject to the rule. Once the model .rule
has been established, EPA would tailor the rule to ask certain questions
about particular chemical substances.
While such a model rule may establish consistent information requests
to companies, the draft reporting form includes burdensome questions and
questions related to EPA programs other than TSCA. As of yet, EPA has not
developed an Agency procedure to prevent duplicative information requests
under this draft rule. The Health and Safety Committee's Notification and
Reporting Task Group is reviewing the draft and will submit comments to
EPA in early October.
Negotiated Testing. From March through July, CMA, EPA, and the
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) worked to develop a procedure for
negotiating test agreements and developing test rules under TSCA Section 4.
This collaborative effort grew out of CMA's appeal of a District Court
decision that invalidated EPA's previous procedures for negotiating test
agreements under TSCA Section 4.
The guiding principle in developing this new procedure has been that
test rules and negotiated testing agreements should be equivalent.
Consent orders under TSCA Section 4 would be the primary mechanism to
satisfy that principle. As with test rules, the consent orders would
include requirements to ensure adequate and reliable data, would be
enforceable, and would require export notification under TSCA Section
12(b). In addition to these features of the consent order, the new
procedures would include an opportunity for public participation, an
expedited schedule for negotiating and rulemaking, and a change in
Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) procedures to provide sufficient time
Page
12
CMA 038337
to either negotiate agreements or prepare rules on chemicals the
ITC nominates to EPA for testing consideration.
In August, the final draft of the preamble and procedural rule were
reviewed by the Health and Safety Committee. After sign-off by
the parties involved, EPA will issue the procedures as an interim final
rule in the fall.
Technical and Research Activities
PMN Exposure Assessment
The Exposure Assessment Task Group reviewed, commented on, and
discussed with EPA that Agency's draft guidance for preparing engineering
analyses. EPA plans to use the analyses to estimate exposures to PMN
substances. EPA is now revising its guidelines and plans to seek
additional outside review of the document.
Identifying Acute Hazards
CMA reviewed EPA's draft criteria for identifying acute hazards, and
submitted comments to the Science Advisory Board. EPA generally followed
a logical approach in its criteria, but used incomplete methods for
assessing potential harm and potential exposure, failed to ensure the use
of accurate data, omitted significant limitations in methodology from its
discussion, and did not focus its criteria on the intended purpose for
which materials were to be identified.
International Regulation
On August 21, CMA President Bob Roland and SCCMA president Ron Lang
signed a joint letter addressed to the Administrator of EPA, Administrator
of OSHA, Director of Office of OMB and the U.S. Trade Representative,
transmitting for their information and use the finished work product of
the Joint IAG/CEFIC/CCPA Work Group on Assessment of Chronic Hazards.
This report represents the effort of a distinguished group of
toxicologists from the U.S., Europe, and Canada to harmonize definitions
on carcinogens, mutagens, and teratogens. The work was initiated over a
year ago and required major coordinating meetings in both Brussels and
Washington. It represents the first international agreement of industrial
groups on terminology and is an excellent first step in developing better
international cooperation between the U.S. and its major trading
partners.
International Trade/Intemational Competition
Congressional Developments and Response
Revision of Trade Remedy Laws
As he did in the last Congress, Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-7-FL) has
introduced a bill to amend countervailing duty laws by defining as a
subsidy the practice of using natural resource raw^materials not available
Page
13
to foreign investors for the production of finished goods. This provision
was included in a bill which passed the House by a sizeable margin in the
last Congress. The natural resources provision was deleted by the
House/Senate Conference which produced the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984.
The current Gibbons bill (H.R. 2451) would require the U.S. manufacturer
to prove that injury has occurred before countervailing duties could be
imposed. The addition of this injury test is an attempt to achieve
support from the Administration for the concept. The Administration,
however, still views the proposal as protectionist and is opposing it.
The Trade Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee has
already held several days of hearings on the issue, and plans additional
hearings in the fall.
The CMA Executive Committee declined to take a position on the
natural resources issue at its March 6, 1984 meeting.
Import Surcharge
Representative Dan Rostenkowski (D-8th-IL) has introduced a bill
which would impose an import surcharge on all goods from selected
countries. The bill was introduced with 65 co-sponsors, but a substantial
additional number of Congressmen are expected to also co-sponsor the bill.
Hearings on this matter are planned for early Fall.
The bill would apply to all countries whose 1984 imports to the U.S.
exceeded $14 billion. One half of this initial amount, or $7 billion, is
to be indexed in future years to the 1984 U.S. Gross National Product.
Any country which meets the above eligibility must keep its ratio of
imports to the United States to exports from the United States below 1.5
(or ratios of world-wide imports to exports below 1.65). If it fails to
do so, all imports from that country will be assessed a 25 percent ad
valorem rate of duty which is in addition to any existing duty already in
use.
Earlier this year, the Motorola Corporation proposed an
across-the-board import surcharge for three years as a means of combatting
the deficit. Such a proposal has yet to be introduced as legislation.
CMA's International Trade Committee has held preliminary discussions
on the concept of an import surcharge. It appears that the Committee is
opposed to an across-the-board imposition of additional duties, but it has
not yet decided whether to take a position.
International Negotiations/Agreements
U.S,/Israel Free Trade Agreement
The U.S./Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been passed by the
Congress and signed into law. it becomes effective in September.
Under the provisions of the agreement, virtually all duties will be
eliminated on goods imported into the United States from Israel. Certain
import sensitive items, including most bromine chemicals, will have duties
Page
14
CMA 038339
phased out over a ten year period rather than having them eliminated
immediately. The FTA does require that goods imported from Israel must
have had a minimum of 35 percent of the value of the good added in Israel.
Also under the FTA, the U.S. International Trade Commission is required
to conduct a study after five years to determine if any industries or
products have suffered harm as a result of the agreement.
The CMA did not establish a position on this agreement because it was
judged to be certain of success. However, member companies were kept
fully informed of developments and of how they could take action in their
own best interests.

worker Right-to-Know. Rep. Joseph Gaydos' (D-PA) Health and Safety
Subcommittee began hearings July 17 on concepts underlying his High Risk
Occupational Disease Notification and Prevention Act, HR 1309. This bill,
in essence crafted at the behest of the AFL/CIO, would require the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to establish
a system for identifying, notifying and preventing illness among workers
who are at increased risk of occupational disease. Dr. Bruce Karrh,
testifying on behalf of du Pont, expressed concerns about establishing an
entire new bureaucracy for communication of hazard information which could
be better handled by existing programs under OSHA.
CMA's Health and Safety Committee is reviewing HR 1309 and expects to
testify in September when hearings resume. Congressman Gaydos has
indicated he intends to complete hearings this year and report the bill
out of committee early next year.
Occupational Disease Compensation. Rep. Pat Williams (D-MT)
recently introduced HR 3090 which would establish an employer/
manufacturer insurance fund to compensate workers who contract asbestosis
and other occupational diseases. This is successor legislation to the
Hiller bill (HR 3175) of the last Congress. Strong AFL/CIO support of
HR 3090 assures favorable attention by the House Education and Labor
Committee. CMA's Health and Safety Committee will be reviewing the
legislation, particularly its broadened occupational disease trigger
mechanism.
Community Right-to-Know (RTK).
In the Senate, Alphonse D'Amato
(R-NY) has been working on a possible Superfund floor amendment to provide
the government and the public with information about the potential dangers
of hazardous substances and a coordinated system for emergency response.
Senator D'Amato chaired a hearing of the Small Business Committee at which
EPA, local govemment/emergency response officials, and small business .
testified as to their reservations about the inventory/emissions "mass
balance" data reporting requirements in Senator Lautenberg's amendment to
S 51 previously reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee.
CMA is working with a coalition of small business associations led by
SOCMA to achieve more practical legislative results. Concepts developed
Page

CMA 038340
by the International Association of Firechiefs will be a key factor in
Senator D*Amato's anticipated legislation. We expect to support Senator
D'Amato's efforts. As soon as his language is finalized, a major effort
will be made by CMA companies to generate support for the D*Amato approach
as a constructive alternative to the Lautenberg amendments to S SI.
In
the meantime, Senator Lautenberg (D-NJ) introduced a new bill dealing with
emergency response, S 1531, which he intends to offer as a floor amendment
to Superfund. Although it is significantly scaled down from prior drafts,
the new bill appears to raise problems which CMA's Health and Safety
Committee will be reviewing during the August Congressional recess.
In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee marked up and
reported out HR 2817 with community RTK provisions essentially intact.
The Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) were preserved as the vehicle for
hazards communication. Emergency response provisions are consistent with
CMA's CAER program. An inventory/emissions reporting amendment (similar
to Senator Lautenberg's) was defeated by the Committee. Trade secret
protection was made consistent with the OSHA hazard communication
standard. The Committee approved a limited preemption of state and local
laws adopted after August 1, 1985. A great deal of effort by CMA and its
member companies resulted in a final RTK product by the Energy and
Commerce Committee which we are generally pleased with and can support in
the House as a better approach than other existing proposals.
Also in the House, the Public Works Subcommitte on Water Resources,
chaired by Robert Roe (D-NJ), held a hearing July 25 on community RTK as
part of its consideration Superfund. John Jones of Dow Chemical, and
Chairman of our CAER task group, testified on behalf of CMA and stressed
the need for a practical approach to emergency response. Members of the
Public works Conmittee are becoming interested in RTK/emergency response,
and may wish to offer their own amendments as part of Superfund. We will be
working with the business coalition to make them as close to HR 2817 as
possible, or otherwise improve proposals in that Committee.
Technical and Research Activities
Labeling. The Health and Safety Committee's Labeling Task Group met
August 1 to begin updating the 1982 version of the American National
Standard for hazardous industrial chemicals/precautionary labeling. CMA
will assume once again the role of canvassing sponsor for the standard.
The major consideration of the Labeling Task Group will be to address
the precautionary labeling of chronic hazards.
Litigation and Related Legal Activities
Hazard Communication Litigation. On May 24, 1985, the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled that the OSHA hazard communication standard
preempts state right-to-know laws as they apply to manufacturers. United
Steelworkers of America v, Auchter, 763 F.2d 728 (3d Cir. 1985 ). CMA
intervened in the case to argue for preemption and to defend the
standard's trade secret provision. The court left open the question of
whether state right-to-know laws that cover employers beyond the
manufacturing sector and that have community right-to-know provisions are
preempted by the federal hazard communication standard. The Court said
Page
16
CMA 038341
that question must be answered by examining each state law to determine if
the provisions are "inextricably intertwined." There are two cases, pending
in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where preemption of right-to-know laws
outside the manufacturing sector and in the community is an issue.
The Court also ordered OSHA to amend its definition of "trade secret"
and in doing so, not to go beyond the common law definition. OSHA was
also ordered to provide for employee access (both the manufacturer's
employees as well as downstream employees) to trade secret information.
The standard currently provides such access only to health professionals.
No party has petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case. At this
time, it appears there will be a new rulemaking on the trade secret
issues, and OSHA will also publish an advanced notice of proposed
rulemaking on the issue of expanding the scope of coverage of the
standard, which was also ordered by the Court.
communications
Institute: CMA received and responded to 400 media calls in five
days following the accidental release at Institute. Spokesmen appeared on
ABC's Nightline, CNN's Newsmakers, CBS's Nightwatch and a number of radio
network programs. Assistance was also provided to CXC spokesmen f<->r
regional appearances.
Special marketing research techniques are being adapted to analyze
audience response to industry messages about plant safety emergency
response and risk management.
Clean Air
Congressional Developments and Response
Dingell Survey. CMA transmitted to Congressman John Dingell (D-MI)
on June 21 responses to his April 3 letter requesting that CMA conduct
surveys in three study areas regarding monitoring and detection of
chemical releases into the air and emergency response systems among
chemical plants. The transmittal to Dingell included the individual
survey questionnaires which CMA member companies completed for
approximately 90 chemical plants located in Baton Rouge-New Orleans,
Philadelphia- Wilmington-South New Jersey, and Buffalo-Niagara Falls. CMA
has written members of Congress whose districts fall within the survey
areas to inform them about the survey and to indicate that they will
receive CMA's analysis. CMA's Clean Air Act Task Group plans visits to
the 22 members of Congress to deliver the analysis.
House Activity. The Toxic Release Control Act (H.R. 2576),
introduced by Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA), was the topic of two days
of hearings in June before Waxman's Health and the Environment
Subcomnittee. CMA testified on June 11th that H.R. 2576 is not an
effective and efficient approach to potential public health risks
presented by the release of toxic chemicals into the air; that a bill must
distinguish more clearly between large volume accidental release of
Page
17
CMA 038342
acutely toxic materials and low-level exposures to substances over longer
periods of time; and, that CMA is prepared to help Congress design
appropriate legislation while continuing to develop and implement new
initiatives to control hazardous air pollutants. Also during the June 11
hearings, Congressman John Dingell (D-MI) voiced strong opposition to H.R.
2576. At the other day of hearings, there were industry witnesses,
representing aluminum, electric power, motor vehicles and consumer
products. An effort to affix portions of H.R. 2576 to the Superfund
legislation failed during mark-up in the Energy and Commerce Committee.
Even if Waxman succeeds in getting a bill out of his subcommittee, full
committee consideration seems unlikely.
Senate Activity. In the Senate, committee hearings might get under
way this fall on clean air amendments as a whole.
Regulatory Developments and Response
Revised Particulate Matter Standard. The Air Pollution Effects Task
Group developed comments on EPA's proposed revisions to the particulate
matter national ambient air quality standard. CMA's comments highlight
several scientific and technical deficiencies in the proposal. The final
standard will be the basis for states revising the state implementation
plan for particulate matter.
Hew Source Performance Standards. The Process Emissions Regulation
Task Group developed consents on EPA's proposed air oxidation processes and
distillation operations new source performance standards. These consents
were in response to EPA* s reopening the consent period and requesting
additional comments on its TRE regulatory model. CMA was generally
supportive of EPA's proposed approach on its cost-effectiveness model,
although we offered several technical recommendations to improve its
applicability.
Vinyl Chloride HESHAPS Judicial Intervention. The Environmental
Management Committee authorized CMA's intervention in a judicial suit
supporting EPA's proposed revisions of the vinyl chloride hazardous air
pollutant standard. This litigation will resolve the question of whether
EPA is properly interpreting Section 112 of the Clean Air Act in
developing standards that assure an "ample margin of safety".
Technical and Research Activities
Dingell Survey Report. The Process Emission Regulations Task Group
and its Monitoring Work Group have completed the analysis of a survey
requested by Congressman Dingell of chemical industrial plant air
monitoring. The survey was conducted in three distinct areas — Hew
Orleans-Baton Rouge, Hiagara Falls, and Philadelphia-WilmingtonSouth Hew Jersey. The final report will be submitted to Congressman
Dingell and to the Office of Technology Assessment.
Air Task Groups Sunsetting. The Environmental Management Committee
disbanded the Air Regulations Task Group and the Toxics Integration Task
Group. The activities of the Air Regulations Task Group will be conducted
by a work group of the Process Emission Regulations Task Group. The
Page

CMA 038343
activities of the Toxics Integration Task Group will be conducted by a
work group of the Air Pollution Effects Task Group.
Litigation and Related Activities
Vinyl Chloride Litigation. CMA has moved to intervene in a court
suit brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) challenging
EPA's emission standards for vinyl chloride under section 112 of the Clean
Air Act. This case will probably be the first to decide the meaning of
the "ample margin of safety" test of section 112. NRDC contends that
section 112 requires ERA to set "zero-risk, zero-emmissions" standards for
all carcinogens. CMA and the American Petroleum Institute, who also
intervened, will argue in support of EPA's position in the case, that the
Agency is authorized to taka cost and feasibility into account in setting
emission standards under section 112. NRDC filed its brief on June 17,
with EPA's response submitted on July 25. The CMA/API brief will be filed
on August 19. A decision is expected by the spring of 1986.
Clean Water
Congressional Developments and Response
Clean Water Legislation. The Senate approved S. 1128 by a vote of
94-0 on June 13th. In the House, Congressman Robert Roe (D-NJ) worked out
a block of committee amendments to H.R. 8 which CMA and industry
representatives discussed with Roe. On July 23, the House passed H.R. 8
by a vote of 340-83. Despite the threat of a White House veto because of
construction grant funding, it appears possible that Congress will
complete work on s. 1128 before this session ends. S. 1128 and the
House-passed version reflect CMA efforts for extensions, modifications
deletions and report language clarifications. The bills are improved over
original proposals in several areas CMA sought including: extended
compliance deadlines; increased protection against citizen suits relative
to administrative penalties; affirmative defense under criminal penalties;
narrowing of the mandatory reopener requirements in NPDES permits;
affirmation of the Fundamentally Different Factors (FDF) variance although
with some procedural limitations; and a provision improving stormwater
run-off requirements. CMA currently is preparing for conference activity
in September.
Regulatory Developments and Response
Pretreatment. The Effluent Guidelines Task Group developed comments
on EPA's proposed revisions to its pretreatment regulations. The
proposal revises the definitions of "interference” and "pass through” for
purposes of determining extent of pretreatment control necessary. CMA's
comments generally supported the changes since they brought the
definitions more in line with our original views on this matter.
EPA Biomonitoring. The Water Quality Criteria and Standards Task
Group developed comments on EPA's biomonitoring study conducted in Lima,
Ohio. EPA requested CMA to peer review the study. CMA's comments were
?age
19
CMA 038344
generally supportive of the study and how it was conducted, and offered
constructive comments on how to improve the report.
Technical and Research Activities
Effluent Guidelines Seminar. The Effluent Guidelines Task Group
developed and conducted a seminar on EFA's proposed revisions to the
organic chemical, plastics, and synthetic fibers effluent guidelines. The
seminar was attended by approximately ISO member company representatives.
Speakers were from the task group, CMA staff, CMA consultants, and
representatives from EPA.
Permit Limitations Uncertainty/Variability. The Environmental
Monitoring Task Group developed a technical paper highlighting
uncertainty and variability in a wide spectrum of environmental areas. Of
specific concern are NPDES permit limitations and the documented degree of
uncertainty and variability that exists. The paper elaborates on this
points since these questionable numerical limitations can form the basis
for EPA enforcement actions and/or citizen suits with potentially
significant penalties being imposed.
Litigation and Related Legal Activities
NPDES Citizen Suits. A federal district court in Virginia has issued
the first civil penalty award in an enforcement ease brought by a citizen
under the Clean Water Act. The penalty was based on a series of permit
violations that occurred over approximately three years. The court
performed a lengthy, detailed review of the factual situation and assessed
different penalties for various violations depending on the specific
circumstances (ranging from $50/day to $4,000/day). The decision is being
appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. If upheld, the ruling
could serve as an important precedent for the many other courts now faced
with similar citizen suit claims.
Chemical Product Distribution
Congressional Developments and Responno
Hazardous Materials Transportation
The reauthorization of Superfund legislation and increased
Congressional attention regarding hazardous substance and safety issues
have intensified discussions pertaining to the transport of hazardous
materials and emergency response. Hazardous materials transportation
issues are expected to be included in hearings on environmental matters.
Representative James J. Florio (D-NJ-1) has sponsored a measure that
includes the creation of a federal regional training program on hazardous
chemicals. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) has offered legislation
that requires contingency planning and an inventory of hazardous materials
transported. He has also introduced a community emergency response and
right-to-know bill that may be offered on the Senate floor as an amendment
to the Superfund bill.

CMA 038345
CMA is monitoring proposals affecting the movement of hazardous
materials. Input is being provided for a Congressionally-mandated study
by the Office of Technology Assessment. Discussions are being conducted
with a hazardous materials advisory task group at the Department of
Transportation regarding initiatives to insure more efficient and safe
transportation of hazardous materials. CMA also continues to participate
in a coalition with public and private sector groups in seeking a
consensus approach to federal/state/local uniformity of hazardous
materials transportation regulations.
Rail Competition
Hearings are expected to continue after the August recess in both the
Senate and House Judiciary Committees regarding antitrust implications of
railroad rate practice. The Rail Antitrust Monopoly Act offered by
Senator Dennis DeConcini (D-AZ) and Representative John D. Sieberling
(D-OH-14) is the subject of discussion and is undergoing redrafting.
Bills have been introduced that would curb high railroad rates and
protect captive shippers by way of regulatory changes by Senator Russell
D. Long (D-LA) and Mark Andrews (R-ND) and Representatives W. j.
"Billy" Tauzin (D-LA-3) and Nick Jo Rahall (D-WV-4). Legislation that
would set standards for rail rates and determining when rail carriers have
market dominance has also been introduced by Senator Wendell H. Ford
(D-KY) and Representative Rahall. Hearings have not been scheduled, but
activity may occur in the session when the Interstate Commerce Commission
(ICC) completes a rulemaking presently underway that addresses rail
competition. The bills introduced have not received the support of the
Administration. Some Congressional support is further present for linking
rail competition issues and protection for captive shippers with
legislative proposals under consideration to transfer Conrail to the
private sector.
Differing views exist among the many shipping coalitions that have
been formed as to whether the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 needs refinement,
major amendment or left to proper implementation by the ICC. CMA
continues to work to maintain and enhance rail-to-rail competition and
insure proper implementation of existing law. Negotiations with the
railroads have resulted in some agreement with regard to pro-competitive
access issues. The agreement between CMA and the American Association of
Railroads (AAR) has resulted in am ICC proposed rulemaking and would
basically obviate the need for legislation on matters addressed.
Discussions with congressional leaders and ad hoc groups continue as
legislative measures ire proposed.
Conrail
Bipartisan bills have been introduced that would sell the
Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) to an investor group formed by
Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. The legislation provided for the sale of the
government's 85 percent share of the freight system for $1.2 billion and
resale of at least €0 percent of the railroad to the public through one or
more stock offerings within five years.

CMA 038346
The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee reported
bill would authorize the sale of Conrail to the Norfolk southern
Corporation. The Administration is supporting the private offering to
Norfolk Southern as the result of a DOT approved bid process. Opposition
to a Conrail merger with Norfolk Southern continues regarding
antitrust/competitive implications and the tax benefits that would derive.
Senate Judiciary Committee amendments to the Administration bill are
expected, and there is indication that a filibuster could occur.
On the House side, the hearing process will continue after the August
recess. The use of Conrail tax deductions as well as the antitrust
aspects of a merger are under review by the House Ways and Means Committee
and the House Judiciary Committee, respectively. Additional hearings will
be held before the House Energy and Connerce Subcommittee on Commerce,
Transportation and Tourism.
The Morgan Stanley plan, backed by Conrail management and
will be the primary focus of hearings in the fall. Supporters
amendments to the Staggers Bail Act to provide captive shipper
may also attempt to link other rail issues with the passage of
Conrail enabling legislation.
rail labor,

protection
the sale of
Concern has been expressed during hearings that provisions must be
included in any Conrail sale agreement to assure competition. CMA has
advocated the assurance of rail competition in the Northeast Corridor.
The Morgan Stanley Company proposal for a public offering is supported by
CMA as the most viable option for the disposition of Conrail.
Regulatory Development and Response
Conrail Acquisition. The Distribution Cosuittee developed a position
paper on the Administration's proposal to sell the Conrail system to the
Norfolk/Southem Railroad Corporation. Of primary concern is the
reduction in competitive service that may occur if Conrail is sold to
Norfolk Southern. CMA believes a public sale of Conrail, as proposed by
Morgan Stanley fi Company, would not reduce competitive rail service in the
Eastern O.S.» therefore, CMA supports the Morgan Stanley proposal.
Rates and Compensation
Tank Car Compensation. CMA, other tank car providers, and the
railroads have successfully arrived at an agreement on the appropriate
level of compensation for tank car use. This level of payout is $554
million. The issues of enforceability and the form and duration of the
agreement have also been resolved. The joint agreement has been submitted
to the ICC for rulemaking.
Rail to Rail Competition. A compromise agreement between CMA and the
railroads on the issue of competitive access to shipping facilities has
been reached. This agreement is intended to enhance the competitive
alternatives available to chemical shippers by allowing rail carriers to
compete for freight when they do not control the track immediately serving
a plant.
"age

CMA 038347
CMA and the railroads have jointly petitioned the ICC to enact our
agreement. CMA also submitted a supplemental petition to expand the scope
of the rulemaking by including the concepts of proportional rates and
terminal facilities. CMA participated in oral argument on July 18 and
anticipates the ICC ruling on the issues by mid-September.
On July 17, the ICC issued a 4-3 decision in Midtee vs. CNW that, if
upheld, could substantially undermine the benefits of the agreeme-4reached with railroads. The Commission ruled that before it will order
competitive access for the competing carrier, the controlling carrier must
be shown to be market dominant and charging an unreasonably high rate.
CMA is considering intervening in the appeal of the Midtec case.
Product and Geographic Competition. Before a shipper may challen^ rail rate as being unreasonably high, the shipper must demonstrate th~*
the railroad has "market dominance" over the traffic. Two factors being
considered are whether the receiver can obtain the product from other
sources (geographic competition) or can obtain substitute products
(product competition). On July 31, 1985, the ICC announced that it will
modify its product and geographic competition guidelines. The major
changes will be (1) that the railroad must bear the burden of proving
these issues, and (2) the effect of geographic competition will be viewed
differently, depending on whether the shipper is the receiver originator
of the product. The ICC adopted a few of CMA's suggested changes to the
proposed rules, but rejected our'most significant changes, as well as
CMA's petition for a supplemental rulemaking that would have applied a
Herfindahl market share analysis to the market dominance issue.
Coal Rate Guidelines. The ICC recently adopted the criteria by which
it will judge the reasonableness of coal rates. The criteria are likely
to be proposed for chemical rates in a separate rulemaking soon. The
criteria would permit a railroad to charge a rate based on what it would
hypothetically cost the shipper to build and maintain a rail line for its
traffic. The rate must also reflect contributions to the cost by other
shippers and efficient operations by the railroad.
Argentina/Brazil Cargo Reservation Laws. CMA developed evidence
demonstrating the adverse effects resulting from the cargo reservation
laws enacted by Argentina and Brazil. Conments setting forth the
industry's concerns were submitted to the Federal Maritime Commission.
CMA participated in a delegation of government officials that undertook a
fact-finding mission to Brazil to determine the anticompetitive impact of
the Brazilian laws.
Chemical Bulk Parcel Rates. CMA is opposing efforts by chemical bulk
parcel tanker operators to obtain antitrust immunity to collectively set
rates. CMA believes that competitive pricing is essential and is filing
comnents before the Federal Maritime Commission and seeking legislative
action toward this end.
CHEMTREC
CHEMTHEC activity continues to be well above last year's levels.
Total calls are running 32% above last year and emergency reports are 34%
"age
23
CMA 038348
above last year's totals for the period January through July. We believe
the increases are a result of heightened awareness about the CHEMTREC
program and increased public concern about incidents involving chemicals.
CHEMTREC Workshops. The third Emergency Response Team Workshop will
be held in Baltimore, Maryland at the end of October.
Instruction for
this workshop will be handled by instructors from the Delaware Fire
School.
CHEMNET. Based on a meeting on June 18, 1985, with CMA members, the
CHEMNET Policy Statement and Agreement and the CHEMNET Operating Rules
were revised and resubmitted to the membership on July 1, 1985, for
their consideration.
As of August 16, we have received 20 participant agreements and 16
subscriber agreements from CMA members. These 36 companies represent a
large percentage of the chemicals shipped in this country. We have also
received verbal confirmation from approximately 10 additional companies
that they would join the CHEMNET system. Therefore, we will be beginning
the CHEMNET operations with almost 50 members.
We have also tentatively selected four emergency response contractors
to act as the "for-hire" contractors in the CHEMNET system. These
contractors have teams at locations throughout the United States and can
reach most areas within 3 to 4 hours of notification, we hope to sign
contracts with all four firms.
While 50 members and four contractors represent enough emergency
response capability to start up the CHEMNET system, we must redouble our
efforts to enroll more chemical companies into the system or the public
will misunderstand and be disappointed by the coverage of the CHEMNET
program. A campaign to enlist more companies has begun.
Chemical Referral Center. The Chemical Referral Center <CRC), which
will become operational by the end of 1985, is designed to provide those
that desire health and safety information about a particular chemical with
a company contact that can furnish such information. The Distribution
Committee has established a work group to oversee the operation of the
Chemical Referral Center. Thus far, 93 CMA member companies have signed
on to the program. Information pertaining to the chemicals and products
they produce are being submitted to CMA. This information will be the
foundation of a computerized chemical index that CMA operators will
use to link products with manufacturers as a public service.
Lending Library. The training programs for emergency services
personnel have been purchased for the lending library. A brochure
listing the programs and how to obtain them is now available, and
distribution to fire service organizations and members has begun.
First Responder Videotape Training Program. The script for the
videotape training program has been approved and filming was started T'~~
week of August 19 at the Fairfax County Fire Training facility.

Emergency Response Terms, The final draft of the booklet on
"Recommended Terms for Personnel Protective Clothing" was approved
and should be available for distribution by the end of October. This
document defines and illustrates terms used to communicate to the emergency
responder the different types of personal protective equipment. The
purpose of the document is to ensure clear and consistent communication
between those who offer advice and those who respond.
Technical and Research Activities
Motor Carrier Safety Survey. Reception of this program by the
shipping community and the carrier industry has been very favorable.
Recently the Military Traffic Command expressed a strong interest in
adopting the program for all defense shipments. A comparison of the
accident frequency ratios of the surveyed motor carriers against all other
motor carriers will be undertaken to determine whether the safety records
are actually better than the national average.
Communications
Following a rash of incidents in transporting chemicals, CMA
spokesmen have responded to media questions with statistics on safety and
explanations of CHEMTREC.
Appearances on two national television programs on CBS and CNN were
organized.
Energy and Petrochemical Feedstocks
Congressional Developments and Response
Natural Gas
The debate over natural gas issues is primarily concentrated in the
regulatory arena where the Federal Energy Regulatory Conmission (FERC)
rulemaking process has intensified. FERC activity, particularly a
proposal dealing with the transportation or carriage of gas, is under
close Congressional scrutiny.
An amendment adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee would
prohibit FERC from putting into effect any rule dealing with gas
transportation issues pending Congressional review between enactment of
the energy and water appropriation bill and the end of the first session
of the 99th Congress. Senator J. Bennett Johnston (D—LA) withdrew his
amendment on the Senate floor after assurances made by the FERC chairman.
Opponents of the appropriation amendment believe that FERC is proceeding
under ongoing legislative authority and that limiting the scope of FERC
action is an unwarranted intrusion in the independent regulatory process.
The FERC will probably be allowed to conduct transportation programs while
Congress Is reviewing FERC's rulemaking. House energy leaders opposed the
appropriations amendment, however, the House Fossil and Synthetic Fuels
Subcommittee submitted several substantive questions to FERC regarding the
rulemaking process.
rag
25
CMA 038350
Legislation unlikely to move quickly is pending in both the Senate
and House. A bill introduced by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK) would repeal
incremental pricing and fuel use restraints and decontrol the price of all
gas under renegotiated or expiring gas purchase contracts. Senate
oversight hearings on the status of the natural gas industry have been
held in the Subcotmnittee on Energy Regulation and Conservation. A bill
offered by Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) would require mandatory contract
carriage by pipeline companies.
It is expected that House Energy and Commerce Cononittee Chairman John
Dingell (D-MI-16) and Fossil and Synthetic Fuels Subcommittee Chairman
Philip R. Sharp (D-IN-2) will hold oversight hearings on natural gas
issues, including matters presently before the FERC. Repeal of gas
incremental pricing provisions of the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA) and
Fuel Use Act (FUA) restrictions are the focus of most attention in the
House. Representative Jim Slattery (D-KS-22) and Dan Coates (R-IN-4) havr>
introduced a bill that just repeal the natural gas demand restraints under
the FUA and NGPA. Representative Bill Richardson (D-MM-3) and William E.
Dannemeyer (R-CA-39) have proposed a more comprehensive measure that would
repeal demand restraints, further deregulate and require contract
carriage.
CMA continues to monitor legislative proposals and file comments and
present testimony before FERC. CMA has requested that FERC act
expeditiously on issuing a rule on nondiscriminatory transportation.
Oil Import Fee
A Congressional attempt was made before the August recess to propose
an oil import fee as part of the Federal budget deficit reduction package.
President Reagan flatly rejected the proposal, consistent with his stated
desire not to increase taxes to reduce budget deficits. However, a
continuing willingness has been demonstrated by key Senate leaders to
consider some form of taxation on energy as a means to generate revenue.
Senate budget conferees offered a proposal that would impose a $5 per
barrel levy on imported crude oil and a $10 per barrel fee on imports of
refined petroleum products. The proposal was endorsed by Senate Majority
Leader Robert J. Dole (R-KS), Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete V.
Domenici (R-NM), and Finance Committee Chairman Senator Bob Packwood
(R-OR). Some Administration opposition to an oil import fee has been
qualified and the negotiations over budget matters may revive interest in
additional taxes on energy. Proposals that may be considered during
budget deliberations include a broad-based consumption sales tax on
energy, a BTU tax, a value added approach, an increased gasoline excise
tax, crude oil excise taxes and oil import fees. A current market surplus
of petroleum coupled with the OPEC price decline is also influencing the
views of many in Congress.
Legislation that would impose a $10 per barrel fee on imported oil
and refined petroleum products has been introduced by Representative James
H. Weaver (D-OR-4) and Senator Gary Hart (D-CO). Senators David Boren
(D-OK) and Lloyd Bent'sen (D-TX) are also sponsoring legislation that would
26
CMA 038351
levy a tax on imported oil and oil products. A bill has also been offered
by Representative Anthony C. Beilenson (D-CA-23) that would phase in a SO
cent a gallon excise tax on gasoline. Senator Lowell P. Weicker (R-CT)
has offered a proposal that would phase in a 30 cent increase in the
gasoline excise tax. No immediate action is expected on the bills
introduced.
The economic impact of various energy taxes on the chemical industry
continues to be monitored and reviewed at CMA. Key Administration
officials have been contacted concerning the impact of energy taxes on the
chemical industry. CMA advocacy and liaison with other industry groups is
oriented in opposition to the imposition of new or additional energy
taxes. A broad coalition has sent a letter to President Reagan
reiterating opposition to any additional tax on energy.
Regulatory Developments and Response
Rulemaking on Transportation of Natural Gas. On May 30, 1985, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposed a major rule with respect to
the regulation of natural gas. The purpose of the rule is to require
non-discrimination in blanket transportation programs and to encourage
competition in natural gas markets.
CMA joined a broad coalition of industrial users in submitting
comments on the proposed rule. These coments expressed support for the
major policy directions and many of the details of the Connission's
proposals. The comments, however, also urged several important
modifications. In particular, the Connission should not adopt the Part D
approach for separate billing of low- and high-priced gas.
In addition to written comments, CMA testified before the Commission
on August 2. The testimony strongly supported the Commission's efforts to
facilitate equal access to outer continental shelf gas and urged further
actions in this regard. The testimony also criticized the Commission for
failing to address the substantial regulatory obstacle created by
incremental pricing. CMA urged the Comaission to suspend the operation of
the incremental pricing program for a definite period of time. Finally,
CMA asked the Connission to withdraw Part D of the proposed rule.
Eliminating traditional rolled-in pricing in favor of allocating and
billing "old" gas separately from all other gas would create serious
distortions in the natural gas market.
Taxation
Congress
Hearings on tax reform continued to be the principal issue in July
for both the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on
Finance. Although the cost of each of these provisions may vary from
company to company, their combined impact to the chemical industry will
exceed $2.5 billion annually. On July 30, Dexter F. Baker, Chief
Executive Officer, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., testified on behalf
of the Association before the Committee on Ways and Means. In his
Page
27
CMA 038352
testimony, which was followed by a 45-minute colloquy with several members
of the Committee, Mr. Baker demonstrated a very credible knowledge of
related tax and trade issues.
CMA* s position on tax reform legislation may be briefly summarized in
these key points:
o Support of comprehensive tax reform and President Reagan's
goals of economic growth, fairness and simplicity.
However, the Administration's May 28, 1985 tax proposals
fail to meet these goals.
o The proposed shift of current individual tax burdens to
corporations, and more specifically to capital-intensive
corporations, will seriously damage the economy and the
prospects for sustained growth.
o In order to keep U.S. products competitive in domestic and
world markets, O.S. manufacturers need capital cost
recovery provisions comparable to those our foreign
competitors enjoy. Thus, Congress should maintain the
investment tax credit and Accelerated Cost Recovery System
(ACRS) and should reject the recapture tax on the so-called
"windfall" from accelerated depreciation.
o The limit on foreign tax

country-by-country limit
for foreign assets would

credits should continue to be
basis. The proposed change to a
and the 17-year depreciable life
substantially increase the threat
o The "title passage" test should remain the basis for
determining the source of income for exports and similar
sales. In addition. Congress should reject the proposed
change in the allocation of interest expenses.
o The 25-percent tax credit for research and experimentation
should be extended as proposed by the President, and the
moratorium on allocation of research and development
expenses under Regulations 1.861-8 should be made
permanent.
The House Senate compromise on a Joint Congressional Resolution on
the Budget for Fiscal 1986 has cooled a threat that an oil import fee or
tax increase proposal would be adopted to gain control over mounting
Federal deficits. President Reagan's efforts to secure a compromise on
the Congresssional budget resolution have undercut support for his tax
reform plan among Senate Republicans, many of whom contend that the
President sacrificed a tough Senate budget stance without first obtaining
offsetting savings from the House Conferees.
Senate and House leaders have attacked both the fairness and the
revenue neutrality of the Administration's tax proposal. Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Bob Packwood (R-OR) ha£ argued that the proposal's
Page
28
CMA 038353
provisions to repeal the deduction of State and local taxes and the
special deduction for married couples in which there are two wage earners
would increase taxes for many middle-income taxpayers. Citing the revenue
estimates by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, House Ways and
Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-IL) called upon the Administration to
identify where additional revenues could be raised to maintain the
promised revenue neutrality of the overall program. Both challenges would
appear to have had a major impact on the Congressional tax reform debate.
Under these circumstances, Congress could have greater latitude "to
pick-and choose" from the President's tax program in fashioning a
Congressional vehicle.
Anticipating that the Ways and Means Committee could begin the
selection of the specific components of a tax reform bill as early as
September, CMA is developing its plan for further early action on this
important legislation.
The Washington business community is divided on the merits of the
president's tax proposal. As the elements of a Congressional tax
alternative become more definite, the opportunities for greater business
unity will increase significantly. CMA continues to coordinate its
efforts on tax legislation with allied business and trade groups.

1987 National Electrical Code. This code is mandatory for a large
number of cities, counties and states and it has a significant cost and
safety impact on CMA members. The Electrical Codes and Standards Task
Group will prepare CMA comments at its September 24 and 25 meeting and
member companies are also encouraged to submit comnents. Historically,
CMA participation in this activity has resulted in improved safety and
$100 million per year cost savings for members.
National Electrical Manufacturers Association Liaison. CMA reviewed
the NEMA Standard Procedure for Evaluating Ground Fault Circuit
Interrupters for Response to Conducted Radio Frequency Energy. CMA
recommended that the procedure should be developed to guarantee that
ground fault circuit interrupters will not be susceptible to conducted or
radiated radio frequency energy.
UL 486E. CMA reviewed the UL Standard for Safety Equipment Wiring
Terminals for Use with Aluminum and/or Copper Conductors. CMA objected to
a proposal that this standard be recognized as an American National
Standard because, in our view, the test procedure should be further
developed to provide for testing these terminals under actual field
conditions.

Patents and Protection of Technology
Congress
Process Patent Legislation. Process patent legislation has been
introduced in both the House (H.R. 1069, introduced on February 7, 1985,
by Congressman Carlos Moorehead (R-CA)) and Senate (s. 1543, introduced
on July 31, 1985, by Senators Mathias (R-MD) and Lautenberg (D-NJ)). CMA
has endorsed neither bill. However, CMA has supported generally the need
for enactment of legislation which would give the owner of a process
patented in the United States the right to bring a suit for patent
infringement against a party who imports a product that is manufactured
abroad by using the process.
State Legislative and Regulatory Activity
Superfund
Missouri. Missouri's method of paying for hazardous waste cleanups
will change in 1987 under a law signed by Governor John Ashcroft. The
hazardous waste cleanup program currently is funded with an employee tax
imposed on each hazardous waste generator. Under the new statute, the
"head tax" will be replaced by a waste volume tax effective
January 1, 1987, or earlier if receipts to the remedial fund fall below
$1.5 million annually. Hazardous waste which is landfilled or stored'will
be taxed at twice the rate for treated or recycled waste. Missouri's
Hazardous Waste Management Commission is directed by the new law to set
the tax rates to generate approximately $1.5 million from the fees. In
addition, the statute requires the director of the state Department of
Natural Resources to request general revenues or federal funds equal to at
least one-third the amount levied against generators.
Vermont. A tax on hazardous waste generated in Vermont took effect
July 1 to finance a state fund to clean up hazardous waste sites. In
addition to creating a state Superfund, the law subjects industries to
strict, joint and several liability for cleanup costs. Under the law, the
state does not have to prove negligence in order to hold a party liable
for cleanup costs. Those responsible for disposal or contamination of any
part of a particular site can be held liable for the entire cleanup cost.
The Superfund will be used for remedial action, investigations, removal of
waste, spill control and reimbursement of expenses by local governments
and others.
Texas. A comprehensive program to regulate the disposal of hazardous
waste and charge fees for the generation and disposal of hazardous waste
was signed into law in Texas. Industry succeeded in securing several
provisions such as changes to the permitting process. An applicant now
only needs one permit for storage, processing, treatment, disposal or
destruction of solid or hazardous waste. Another provision prevents local
governments from adopting a rule or ordinance that is inconsistent with
the state law.
"age
30
CMA 038355
As a result of the legislation, two funds are created in the state
treasury - the Hazardous Waste Generation and Facility Fee Fund and the
Hazardous Waste Disposal Fee Fund. Facility fees are to be set at
$250-520,000 per year, the generation and facility fund is not to exceed
$35 million a year.
The Hazardous Waste Disposal Fee Fund imposes a $4
per dry weight ton fee on hazardous waste disposal at a land disposal
facility. The bill, however, places a S10 million cap on the fund at the
end of a quarter. Funds collected from the disposal fee are to be
appropriated for the state/federal match for CERCLA and for state-only
cleanup activities.
public Compensation
Minnesota. Amendments to the state's Superfund statute were recently
enacted including a $2 million victims compensation fund. Among the bills
key provisions were:
o Repeal of the causation clause which required a defendant
in a toxic tort case to prove that it did not cause the
injury.
o A change in the retroactivity provision for personal
liability from January 1, 1960 to July 1, 1983, the date
the Minnesota Superfund law went into effect.
o Repeal of the joint and several liability provision.
Conferees, however, deleted a provision that would have
limited the number of times a party could be found joint
and severally liable.
The victims compensation fund, authorized at $2 million, will be
financed through general revenues, although the state can seek repayment
from responsible parties, if known. Victims can recover up to $250,000.
Claims can be submitted for unreimbursed medical expenses, loss of wages
or loss of household labor. The law also provides that survivors can
receive up to $24,000 a year or $2,000 a month. Additionally, persons
with contaminated water can recover up to $25,000 for cither a new water
supply or for decontasiinating existing water resources. If there is a
decrease in the market value of a principal residence due to
contamination, a person can recover up to 75 percent of the loss or
$25,000, whichever is less.
In order to achieve the favorable changes in the existing liability
provisions, industry in Minnesota agreed to the compensation fund and
strongly supported the bill.
Other States. Amendments to California’s 1981 victim compensation
law were also enacted recently. These changes moderately expanded the
program but did not provide significantly more exposure to the industry.
Activity is still underway in Massachusetts where a bill may be considered
in the next six months.
Hazardous Waste

CMA 038356
Michigan. In an effort to discourage the use of landfills, while
promoting alternatives. Governor James Blanchard recently proposed the
imposition of a $10 per ton fee for hazardous waste disposed in landfills
beginning in 1985. The fee, which could be reduced by 50 percent if the
waste is treated, would generate an estimated $2 million in state revenue
which would be applied to additional permit staff and enforcement. The
proposal would also establish a notification, education and inspection
program to assist with the disposal for smaller quantities of waste.
California. A report by the state's Commission for Economic
Development, chaired by Lt. Governor McCarthy, estimates that it will
cost California $4 billion per year for managing hazardous waste. The
commission's report proposed "the 1990 plan" for improving the management
of toxic chemicals in California and minimizing long term costs. Key
elements include reducing the volume of waste sent to dumpsites and
developing new technology for treating waste. Additional short term
measures recommended by the coimnission include assurance that adequate
liability insurance is available for businesses that produce or dispose of
hazardous waste, tougher drinking water standards for the 30 most
widespread toxic contaminants and increased support for technologies that
reduce toxic chemicals in drinking water.
The commission said it will sponsor or recommend legislation to
accomplish the plan's objectives. One proposal would allow the Department
of Health Services to waive state imposed fees on.land disposal of
hazardous waste, up to $60 per ton, for any company that substantially
reduces the volume of hazardous waste disposed of in dumps. Another
proposal would create a state certification process for hazardous waste
management technologies that are considered economically effective and
environmentally safe.
South Carolina. Governor Richard Riley recently signed legislation
that increased the state's contingency fund and placed a fixed limit on
the amount to hazardous waste disposed of in the state. The legislation
more than doubles the fee per ton of hazardous waste disposed of by
landfilling or other means of land disposal, raising the tax from $5/ton
of wastes generated in state to $13/ton. For out-of-state waste received
at a facility, the tax increases from $7.50/ton to $18.
Iowa. Although Iowa was one of the first states to receive interim
authorization over its hazardous waste program, the state has now become
the first to voluntarily withdraw this authority with the program
reverting back to EPA. Due to severe financial shortfalls in the state,
the Legislature approved an appropriations measure that deletes funding of
the hazardous waste program for two years. Because of this legislation,
EPA found the state lacking authority to administer the program after
July 1, and suspended Iowa's authority to issue RCRA permits. Iowa will
retain authority over the state's abandoned and uncontrolled sites, used
oil, site licensing and collection of hazardous waste fees.
Right-to-Know
State Legislation. The issues of chemical hazard information
disclosure in the workplace and the community and local emergency response
Page
32
CMA 038367
planning, have had a very high profile during the 1985 state legislative
sessions. Through the end of July, over 150 right-to-know bills have been
introduced in over 35 states.
Since most legislatures have adjourned for the year or are in summer
recess, it is possible to begin to summarize activity in this area. To
data, 22 states have passed some form of a right-to-know law this year.
Ten of the new laws establish comprehensive worker, community and/or
emergency response programs. These laws were enacted in: Alabama,
Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas,
Vermont and West Virginia.
Five states have passed laws which add community right-to-know or
emergency response requirements to worker right-to-know programs enacted
in previous years. These are: Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland and
Washington. Seven additional states have passed laws which make minor
changes to existing right-to-know programs. Several states meet in
year-round sessions. Of these. New Jersey is debating community
right-to-know legislation, California is considering re-authorization of
its existing program and Michigan is considering a comprehensive law.
Session Review. The task group is beginning to assess the 1985 state
legislative session by reviewing the right-to-know legislation that has
been enacted. Preliminary indications are that the new comprehensive laws
passed in 10 states are generally consistent with CMA policy on worker and
community right-to-know. Most of the laws are based on the Federal OSHA
Standard as they apply to manufacturers, and contain community and
emergency response requirements which could blend with CMA's CAER
initiatives. The task group is developing advocacy documents to be used
in the states which incorporate CMA's policy in this area. An update of
the right-to-know state law compilation is also being prepared which will
include all new legislation passed in 1985.
State Litigation. Court actions are pending in two states, as
industry begins to force states to recognize the Federal OSHA Standard
preemption over state law, as it applies to manufacturers. Oral arguments
were heard on June 18 in the appeal of the New Jersey decision upholding
federal preemption, (New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce et al v.
Hughey). In Pennsylvania a group of regional manufacturing associations
filed suit on July 19, asking the U.S. District Court to grant an
injunction against the State Department of Labor and Industry, prohibiting
the further implementation and future enforcement of that state's worker
and community right-to-know law. No action has occurred on this suit as
yet.
Groundwater
Ohio. The governor recently released a report which defines the
administration's goals and objectives for environmental protection and
natural resource development. High on the governor's priority list is the
cleanup of contaminated ground and surface water to protect the safety of
public and private drinking water. It is anticipated that this initiative
will be addressed in a bill to be introduced in the General Assembly later
Page
33
CMA 038358
this year- Separate legislation will be introduced that will focus solely
on the protection of groundwater.
New Jersey. The New Jersey Senate Energy and Environment Committee
has passed a bill which allows homeowners to petition the state to provide
alternative water supplies when wells are contaminated. Under the
legislation, a homeowner could also petition the Department of
Environmental Protection to test a well for potential contaminants. Funds
for replacing contaminated systems would come from the New Jersey Spill
Compensation Fund and a $10 million appropriation from general revenues.
The New Jersey Chemical Industry Council testified on the bill cautioning
that Spill Fund monies should not be used for unnecessary well testing.
Amendments to the bill from the DEP are expected.
Other Activities. Members of the Hazardous Waste/ Groundwater Task
Group recently participated in the National Conference of State
Legislatures annual meeting. CMA's position papers on groundwater
standards and groundwater monitoring were highlighted during a session on
leaking underground storage tank discussions. In addition, task group
members and CMA staff participated in discussions with the Association of
Washington Business on upcoming testimony on proposed drinking water
standards.
Transportation
New York. A legislative package regulating the transportation of
hazardous materials in New York failed to gain passage. The Legislature,
however, approved and sent to the governor a bill to establish a board
composed of private and public sector representatives to review certain
aspects of the hazardous materials transportation issue. The board would
make recommendations to the Legislature and the governor within a year.
Two cities — Denver, Colorado and Columbus, Ohio — have passed
ordinances controlling the shipment of hazardous cargos, through their
confines. Denver's City Council passed an ordinance which designates
routes for class A or B explosives, some poison materials, organic
peroxides and radioactive materials. Permits, as of July 1, are now
required for trucks carrying hazardous materials through the city. The
cost of the permits will be determined by degree of risk, quantities being
transported as well as additional factors. Applicants must designate a
specified route for their trip and show proof of liability coverage to get
the permits which will last for a year.
Columbus, Ohio has implemented an ordinance which requires through
shipments of hazardous materials to use a bypass around the city and
specifies hours of delivery and permits for deliveries of hazardous
shipments in the downtown area.
The city anticipates that there will be limited requests for such
permits but the permit mechanism will result in better emergency
preparedness since emergency personnel can be better informed of specific
shipments of hazardous materials in heavily populated areas.
Hazardous Materials Transportation.
Members of the task group are
"age

CMA 038359
continuing to work with members of the Good Samaritan Coalition to promote
the passage of good Samaritan legislation in the states,
in addition,
members of the group are working with individual state legislators in New
Jersey, North Carolina and Georgia to expand existing legislation to cover
all hazardous materials, not just LP gas.
Toxic Air
State Legislatures. The two issues receiving the most scrutiny at
the state level in 1985 are acid rain and toxic air contaminants.
Legislation to require an inventory of nitrogen oxide emissions and their
effect on the environment was enacted in Maine. Other states which have
passed resolutions to study the acid rain issue are Minnesota, Virginia,
Washington, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York.
Laws which require programs to regulate air toxics were passed in
Arizona and Rhode Island, and in California, a law was enacted which would
tax air toxics emissions in order to pay for state regulatory programs.
Hazardous air emission inventories have also been a part of the
right-to-know debate at both the state and federal level. A comprehensive
right-to-know law, recently enacted in West Virginia, includes provisions
which require certain manufactures to consolidate all federal, state and
local air emissions permits and provide them to the state. In Florida,
legislation was passed which requires air emissions inventories, and in
Illinois, a bill to inventory emissions of 85 chemicals was narrowly
defeated in the closing days of the session.
State Regulation. Programs to regulate toxic air contaminants are
being developed and implemented in nearly 40 states. Connecticut
continues to work on its final draft plan, and Vermont has recently
released its plan to regulate hazardous air contaminants. Industry
groups are closely monitoring these activities.
Strategy Development. In conjunction with the Environmental
Management Committee's focus on a CMA air toxics work plan, the State
Affairs Toxic Air Task Group is preparing strategies to work the issue in
the states. A system is being established to closely monitor the
legislative and regulatory activities in specific high-priority states and
the task group is being expanded to include member companies with
activities in these states. Comnunication programs will be developed
which can be used to advocate CMA policies at the state level through
member companies and chemical industry councils. The task group is also
working with various technical task groups to integrate state legislative
and regulatory perspectives into CMA's toxic air pollutant program.
Specific Chemical Research and Advocacy
Advocacy Highlights
Allyl Chloride. The Program Panel decided to disband after 10 years
of activities. The Panel undertook toxicologic research projects to
evaluate toxicity potential and submitted research reports to government
35
CMA 038360
agencies. Regulation by EPA is possible under the Clean Air Act; however,
because of low toxicity and exposure potentials, the Agency has placed
allyl chloride at a very low priority. The Panel may reconvene when the
Agency initiates activities on the chemical.
Dibenzofurans/Dibenzodioxins. The DF/DX Panel submitted comments to
EPA on plans for a TSCA Section 4 monitoring test rule. While the Panel
informed EPA that it questions the Agency's authority to require
manufacturers to analyze products for trace contaminants, they indicated a
willingness to cooperate to develop a reasonable test rule. The Panel
advocated the need for an analytical round robin to demonstrate reasonable
analytical parameters for a test rule. The Panel's Analytical Task Group
then met with EPA technical staff to discuss the comments. The proposed
rule is scheduled to be published by EPA in November 1985.
Dow Chemical Company hosted an educational seminar for the DF/DX
Panel and Task Group members in Midland, Michigan. Various
representatives from Dow Chemical Company and Monsanto Company
presented the latest information on the health and environmental effects,
and the fate and environmental sources of dioxins and furans. Tours of
Dow's Analytical and Toxicology laboratories were also arranged for the
attendees. The seminar was extremely successful and provided the Panel
with a technical base from which to develop its comments on various EPA
proceedings.
Ethylhexanoic Acid. The EHA Panel submitted comments on the proposed
test rule on ethylhexanoic acid. The rule proposed subchronic,
developmental and pharmacokinetics testing based upon concern that dermal
exposure might occur during processing. EHA is used solely as an
intermediate in the synthesis of other chemicals and is manufactured and
consumed entirely in enclosed systems.
The Panel contented that exposure to EHA is so limited that there is
no likelihood that EHA could pose a significant risk to workers,
regardless of the outcome of the proposed testing. To obtain additional
information on potential exposure, the Panel is sponsoring a survey of
users.
The Panel also consented on the rationale for requiring testing,
stating that the subchronic and developmental testing is unjustified and
the pharmacokinetics testing is needed only if effects are found in other
tests. Finally, the Panel recommends streamlining the proposed
pharmacokinetics testing to provide data in a more timely and costefficient fashion.
Fluorocarbons. In June, the companies supporting the Fluorocarbon
Program approved a $1,815 million budget for calendar year 1986.
This is a 3.5% increase over the 1985 budget.
Also in June, the Panel released Revision 21 of its "SUMMARY:
Research Program on Effect of Chlorofluorocarbons on the Atmosphere." This
annual publication details all research funded by the Panel in its
thirteen-year history.

In August, the Panel submitted comments to EPA on four draft
documents prepared as part of the Environmental Impact Statement on the
effect of control measures for the protection of the ozone layer. EPA and
the Department of state are conducting the EIS as background to the U.S.
position on activities under the UNEP Convention for the Protection of the
Ozone Layer. In addition, a UNEP resolution, calling for further study to
address both short- and long-term strategies, is being implemented. A
UNEP Steering Committee meeting is planned for September 17-18, 1985, in
London, to organize workshops to be held within the next year.
Glycol Ethers. A Work Group of the Glycol Ethers Panel met with EPA
staff to address remaining technical concerns with industry data submitted
in response to a TSCA Section 4 ANPR on diethylene glycol butyl ether and
its acetate. EPA plans to announce its decision on testing needs in the
fall, and a Federal Register notice is expected in spring 1986.
The National Toxicology Program has three glycol ethers and their
respective acetates under review as candidate chemicals for testing in the
Program. The Panel is maintaining a close liaison with NTP and will
attempt to establish a CMA/NTP Work Group if the chemicals are recommended
for testing by the NTP Executive Committee.
Three triethylene glycol ethers appeared on the 16th interagency
Testing Committee list of priority chemicals recommended for testing under
TSCA Section 4(a). Panel members attended the EPA Public Focus Meeting
and presently are involved in information-gathering. It is possible that
the Panel will sponsor dermal absorption studies on these compounds in
advance of an EPA test rule proposal.
I
Ketones. The Ketones Panel members met with EPA scientists in June
to discuss differences in interpretation of the mutagenicity test data on
MEK and MI8K gathered as part of a negotiated testing agreement. The
Panel considers the ten mutagenicity tests to indicate no need for further
testing on the two compounds. Extensive comments backing the Panel's
position were filed with the Agency. The EPA will respond by the end of
this year.
Methylenedianiline. The MDA Panel submitted comments on OSHA's draft
Federal Register notice announcing the Agency's plans to form a negotiated
Rulemaking Consoittee on MDA. OSHA intends to establish a committee under
the Federal Advisory Committee Act to negotiate issues leading to a
proposed rulemaking on MDA. The committee is to include representatives
of the parties interested in or affected by the outcome of the rulemaking.
Naphthenates. The Naphthenates Panel completed the first phase of •
its dermal absorption study on lead and cobalt naphthenates. The results
have been submitted to EPA under a 1984 agreement with the Agency. The
Panel and EPA will discuss the need for additional testing in the near
future.
Octylphenol. The Panel is reviewing EPA's comnents on a protocol for
an aquatic chronic effects study of octylphenol in rainbow trout. The
Panel intends to start testing within the next several weeks.

CMA 038362
Oleylamine. The Panel recently completed a mutagenicity test on
oleylamine and found the chemical to be devoid of mutagenic potential in
this test system. The report of the Panel-sponsored research was
submitted to relevant agencies.
Phosgene. Representatives of the Phosgene Panel's Engineering and
Safety Practices Task Group met with the Department of Energy and their
contractor, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, to discuss conducting an air
dispersion study of phosgene. The Panel is interested in using the DOE's
new Liquefied Gaseous Fuels Spill Test Facility to evaluate various
mitigation devices for accidental phosgene releases and to assess
different air dispersion models currently available. The facility is
being constructed at the DOE Nevada Test Site.
Phthalate Esters. On behalf of the Phthalate Esters Panel, Dr.
Joseph Rodricks, of Environ Corporation, Mr. Derek Till of Arthur D.
Little, Inc., and Dr. Bernard Astill of Eastman Kodak Company made
presentations to the Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel of the Consumer Product
Safety Commission. The scientists addressed three key issues concerning
the health effects of DEHP — toxicology, exposure, and risk assessment.
Dr. Rodricks, a leading expert in risk assessment, concluded that the
individual lifetime risk associated with DEHP-containing children's
products is probably less than one in one hundred million. According to
Mr. Till, ADL concluded that while the CPSC exposure study is a useful
contribution to the literature, it is inadequate to form the basis for an
exposure assessment. Dr. Astill emphasized that there is overwhelming
evidence that DEHP is not a genotoxic material.
Subsequently, the CHAP completed its draft report on DEHP and
released it for public comment. The report concludes that DEHP is a
non-genotoxic carcinogen with induction of peroxisomes as its probable
mechanism of action. This mechanism, while not proven, would result in a
threshold of exposure to DEHP below which there is no risk. The CHAP
recommended that research on mechanism of action and exposure continue.
The Phthalate Esters Panel decided not to proceed with the second
phase of its environmental effects testing program, which was part of the
1982 negotiated testing agreement with EPA. The Panel decision resulted
from a meeting with the EPA Test Rules Development Branch (TRDB) in May.
TRDB said that it did not intend to review the Panel's Phase I proposal
before fall 1985. Furthermore, the Agency revealed an intention to
publish a proposed test rule on butyl benzyl phthalate in October. The
proposed rule will prescribe substantially more testing than was agreed to
in the negotiated testing agreement. The additional testing would include
all studies that are required to establish a Water Quality Standard on
BBP.
In a letter to EPA Assistant Administrator Dr. John Moore, the Panel
stated that it is concerned that EPA might adopt a similar approach on
other PEs. Efforts to perform further environmental testing are
therefore suspended until the situation is clarified.
Titanium Dioxide. The National Cancer Institute has begun a
feasibility epidemiology study of titanium^dioxide workers. Industry is

rrr—mity Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER)
Program Activiti'~
CMA has sponsored seven CAER Workshops. The workshops were held in
San Francisco, CA; Houston, TX; New Orleans, LA; Chicago, IL; Newark, NJ;
Atlanta GA; and St. Louis, MO. Over 1500 CAER coordinators and plant
managers attended these workshops. In addition, CMA provided industry
briefing teams to, and cosponsored regional CAER workshops with, the West
Virginia Manufacturers Association and the Michigan Chemical Industry
Council.
Over 164 member and nonmember companies have assigned CAER
coordinators. During August, CMA will ask the CAER coordinators to
identify the number of sites participating in the program and the number
that have achieved the first CAER milestone. The target date for the
first milestone was July 1985. To achieve the first milestone, plant
managers will have reviewed the CAER handbook, attended a CAER workshop,
and initiated discussions with local officials to set up coordinating
groups.
To assist CAER coordinators and plant managers in their community
outreach efforts, CMA has prepared a videotape, 35mm slide presentation
and CAER brochure. The Communications Department is making these
materials available to the industry.
CMA is coordinating CAER's implementation with federal agencies. The
response is supportive. In fact, CMA presented the CAER and NCRIC
programs at a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teleconference on
June 25. The teleconference was broadcast to over 60,000 state and
local emergency response officials, industry representatives and elected
officials.
Communications
Significant staff attention is being devoted to support of the
community awareness and emergency response program.
o A special community awareness section of the CAER workbook
was written by a staff/member team to round out instruction
materials.
o Over 6,000 copies of the CAER workbook have been
distributed.
o Two hundred sets of a communication package including video
tape, brochures and a slide presentation have been sold.
^age

CMA 038364
o September 17 an open communications committee meeting will
focus on the communications role in community awareness.
Presentations will be made by small, medium, and large
companies.
o The Communications Committee has recruited a pool of
communication consultants from member companies who will
offer assistance to members without communications staff.
o A CAER newsletter to exchange information about how
companies are implementing the program is being

International AffairTraining in Developing Countries. The World Environment Center
(WEC), under financial support from the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID), has recently completed the first of a number of country
visits aimed at improving the health, environment, and safety of people in
industrial facilities. The unit which WEC sent to Tunisia included a
representative from The Dow Chemical Company and one from Tenneco, Inc.
The team submitted a list of corrective actions which would greatly
improve the environmental safety and health standards of the plants they
visited. A second group, which will include a representative from
Occidental Chemical Corporation, is scheduled to go to India later in the
month. That will be followed by visits to Jordan and other developing
middle eastern nations that have requested assistance.
Additionally, AID has indicated willingness to pay for translation of
the CAER Handbook into Arabic and French. WEC people and AID officials
are extremely complimentary about the CAER Handbook and are anxious to
begin the translation.
Association Liaison
The Council of Chemical Associations met on July 17 and discussed
Superfund, right-to-know, CAER, toxic air, state legislative initiatives
and other issues. The next meeting is scheduled for September 18.

By
Thomas W. Mooney, Vice Chairman
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
the last fiscal year brought a series of remarkable achievements for the IAG.
;n addition to the September 1984 meetings with the Japan Chemical Industry
Association in Tokyo and the Australian Chemical Industry Council in Canberra,
Australia, the IAG met formally for the first time with members of the Canadian
chemical Producers Association in Toronto in May 1985. During this same time
period, discussions were initiated with the European Council of Chemical
Manufacturers' Federations (CEFIC) to establish an international working party
of experts under the auspices of the Safety of Chemicals Committee of CEFIC and
the International Affairs Group of CMA/SOCMA, along with the Canadian Chemical
Producers Association, to establish scientific criteria for identifying and
classifying carcinogens, mutagens and teratogens. The group met first in April
1995 in Brussels and subsequently in Washington in June, to produce harmonized
criteria for identifying such chronic hazards.
Preliminary presentations of
this tripartite agreement in its draft form were given to the Science Advisory
soard to EPA and to the Office of Management and Budget. Following ratification
hy the sponsoring organizations, this document will be presented formally to
the respective government agencies.
The IAG will continue to work with its
European, Canadian, and Japanese counterparts to bring about a better
understanding of and scientific consensus on important future health, safety,
and environmental issues.

IAG'S Major Accomplishments in 1984-1985
o
Joint IAG/JCIA Meeting
On September 24 and 25th the International Affairs Group met with
representatives of JCIA’3 Chemical Safety Control Committee (CSCC)
at the latter's Tokyo offices. For IAG this was the second of three
such meetings this year with chemical industry trade associations of
other countries.
These meetings addressed issues arising from th
laws and regulations intended to reduce chemical risks to health,
safety, and the environment.
IAG and JCIA had earlier exchanged discussion papers on each issue.
These included current status and proposed changes in TSCA and in
Japan's Chemical Substance Control Law.
Chemical inventories,
testing of new and existing substances, labeling, protection of
confidential information, specific chemical identity of substances,
and issues involving the export and import of hazardous substances,
particularly as proposed in the OECD Recommendation and UNEP
Provisional Notification Scheme, were also topics of exchanges
between the two groups.
U.S.-Japan activities to implement OECD recommendations on Good
Laboratory Practices were discussed.
The effect of U.S. right-co­
know laws, as these interact with labeling and confidentiality und r
OSHA and TSCA, were also topics of discussion.
The meeting achieved the following: agreed to implement OECD’s Good
Laboratory Practices, identified, differences between JCIA and IAG
interpretations of draft proposals of "OECD's Guides to Traders and
Manufacturers* in the export of hazardous substances. JCIA and IAG
agreed to work together to resolve these differences within the
framework of OECD's Business and Industry Advisory Council.
o
Joint IAG/ACIC Meeting
The IAG met in Canberra, Australia, on September 27 and 28, 1984,
with members of the Australian Chemical Industry Council (ACIC).
Discussions were focused on Australia's proposed law to implement
the
‘Notification and Assessment Scheme for New Chemicals.*
Representatives from two Australian State Governments, Victoria and
New South Wales, also participated in the meetings. The Australian
Government has announced that mandatory nationwide notification and
assessment for chemicals new to Australia would be implemented by
July 1985. The scheme is patterned on the EEC Sixth Amendm nt. The
prospective manufacturer/importer of a new chemical is required t
provide
information
similar
to that specified for Premarket
Notifications in EEC.
During the course of the meeting the IAG
delegation mentioned many concerns and problems with the proposed
Australian legislation.
As a direct result of these discussi ns,
the Australian Government has agreed to seriously review and modify
their
legislative
initiative, and the implementation of that
legislation has been significantly delayed.
CMA 038369
The ACIC and IAG agreed on the need to protect confidentiality of
trade secret chemical identities of substances, and the group agreed
to
review implementation of the Principles of Good Laboratory
Practice, worker and community right-to-know laws, and the exchange
of information on the export of hazardous substances.
o
Joint IAG/CCPA Meeting
On 29 and 30 May 1985, the IAG met with the Canadian Chemical
Producers Association in Toronto, Canada.
The format for the
meeting was that of a regularly scheduled CCPA meeting, where IAG
invited guests were asked to comment, where appropriate.
The
discussion lasted for two days and included:
a. a complete presentation of the Canadian Workplace Hazardous
Materials Information System (WHMIS) policy framework and review of
the status of the United States Occupational Safety & Health
Administration (OSHA) proposal,
b. discussion of risk assessment and risk management
legislation,
c. discussions of testing and notification as they appear in
the Environmental Containments Act (in Canada);
d. export notification from both the United States and Canadian
perspectives,
e. regulation of substances in Canada,
f. discussion of the OtA-developed CAES and NCHXC Programs (how
the CAES and NCSXC programs complement those now being implemented
in Canada), and
g. discussion of the Tripartite (IAG/CEFIC/CCPA) working Group
on Chronic Hazards.
Xt was agreed that IAG and its members would review the WHMXS
ingredient disclosure list, exchange key AXHC documents on risk
assessment, keep CCPA advised on reauthorization of the U.S. Toxic
Substances Control Act, and assist in obtaining full reciprocity in
the 0. S. for Canadian TDG Segulations.
o
Joint IAG/CEFIC/CCPA Working Group on Chronic Hazards
As a result of extensive discussions between the three organize*
tions, it was agreed that a group of environmental and health and
safety experts would convene in April 1985 in Brussels to lay out a
set of common definitions of chronic hazards. That effort produced
remarkably good agreement and the first of international stature on
the environmental health or safety issues involved.
A subsequent
meeting in June in Washington resolved technical differences within
the group and, by the end of August 1985, the Joint IAG/CEPIC/CCPA
Tripartite Agreement should be ratified by the sponsoring organiza­
tions and be ready for publication.
CMA 038370
Copies of this document will be sent to Appropriate U.S. governmental
agencies and to. the various governmental agencies within the European
Economic Community, as well as to the Canadian agencies responsible for
health, safety and the environment.
o
IAG prepared and delivered position papers on information exchange for
export of hazardous substances through the U. S. Business and Industry
Advisory Committee and the U. S. State Department to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development Chemicals Group and its parent
Environment Committee.
IAG has supported the purposes of the OECD Chemicals Progranun , that is,
to harmonize chemicals regulation in member countries in an effort to
avoid trade barriers that may be caused by inconsistent laws and
regulations.
We have, however, opposed efforts by some officials in the
OECD Secretariat and member governments to turn the Programme into an
international regulatory system.
We have also urged implementation of
the past Chemicals Programme activity into national regulatory schemes
prior to initiation of any new areas of involvement from OECD.
Most OECD countries are just beginning to develop their toxic substances
control legislation, and time is needed for them to implement their own
systems and to assimilate existing OECD guidelines before any additional
substantive OECD activities are undertaken.
IAG believ s that an
international agreement or treaty on chemicals control is premature. IAG
is increasingly looked to by the (J.S. Government and by the OECD as. the
key voice representing U.S. industry.
On a continuing basis, IAG closely follows the agenda of OECD's Chemicals
Group, Management Committee, and their various Expert Groups, consulting
as necessary with the official U.S. Delegation to register U.S.
industry's views on key technical issues
o
The IAG has participated in an increased dialogue with various lem nts
of the United Nations.
Specifically, comments were submitted on UNEP's
Provisional
Notification
Guidelines, on
the
Export
of
Hazardous
Substances.
The State Department has accepted our views that listing
banned, severely restricted, withdrawn or unapproved (in the case of
pharmaceuticals) chemicals is an inappropriate mechanism and that thes
terms are faulty without further definition. An ad hoc task group of IAG
has extensively researched pro's and con's of participation in a jointly
sponsored (UNEP/UNCTC) conference, proposed for late 1985, on the health
and safety aspects of transnational corporations chemical operations in
developing countries. The task group has met with representatives of the
State Department, CBFIC, and people from the corporate comnunity to
discuss whether IAG should participate (as UNCTC has requested), or to
join a 'umbrella organization" such as the International Chamber of
Commerce and attend under their NGO status, or to withdraw from par­
ticipation entirely.
It is expected that this question will be resolved
within the next thirty days.
Irrespective of the outcome, however, the IAG will continue to improve
its liaison with organizations of the United Nations and with those
elements in the private sector dealing on a more direct basis with th UN
groups.

CMA Statement of Key Principles
Concerning a Bilateral
Free Trade Agreement Between
the United States and Canada
Any bilateral free trade agreement must confer balanced
benefits to both the United States and Canada.
Negotiations on the elimination of preferential Canadian
chemical feedstock and energy policies and foreign
investment restrictions must be an integral part of any U.S.
tariff negotiations with Canada.
In this regard, the U.S.
Government must not commit itself to any tariff cuts prior
to obtaining Canadian agreement to eliminate these
non-tariff trade and investment barriers.
Other non-tariff trade barriers, such as inadequate
protection of intellectual property rights, should also be
considered in any free trade negotiations between the United
States and Canada.
The tariff elimination components of a bilateral free trade
agreement between the United States and Canada should
include all chemicals and related products and should not be
restricted to chemical industry subsectors or specific
products.
The U.S. government should consult with the U.S. chemical
industry and provide adequate opportunities for timely
industry input before and during U.S. negotiations with
Canada.
Any free trade agreement should require that all products
eligible for duty-free entry into the United States under
the agreement must have a Canadian value added level of 70
percent or greater, with an unlimited allowance permitted
for the value of U.S. components.
A bilateral free trade agreement with Canada should provide
for the mandatory reimposition of duties in the event of
non-fulfillment of the conditions of the agreement.
Any bilateral free trade agreement with Canada should
contain an adequate and binding dispute settlement
mechanism.
Free trade negotiations with Canada should also address
other issues, such as how temporary trade distortions caused
by currency fluctuations and injury to a domestic industry
by duty-free entry of products will be handled, to avoid
impairment of the benefits under any bilateral free trade
agreement.

CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION:
COMMENTS ON A BILATERAL FREE
TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES
AND CANADA
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The following comments of the Chemical Manufacturers
Association (CMA) on a possible bilateral free trade agreement
between the United States and Canada present issues which CMA
believes must be addressed by the United States prior to entering
into any such agreement.
First, CMA believes that any bilateral free trade agreement .
must confer balanced benefits to both the United States and
Canada.
One country must not benefit to the detriment of the
other.
Second, CMA believes that the long-term objective of such a
free trade agreement is to achieve an open environment for
international trade and investment unencumbered by barriers and
governmental intervention in the marketplace.
In this regard, we
believe that any free trade agreement must address non-tariff
barriers to trade.
For example, we believe that negotiations on
the elimination of preferential Canadian chemical feedstock and
energy policies and foreign investment restrictions must be an
integral part of any U.S. free trade negotiations with Canada.
CMA 038374
Moreover, we believe that other non-tariff trade barriers, such
as inadequate protection of intellectual property rights, should
also be considered in any free trade negotiations between the two
countries.
CMA is aware that the Administration is evaluating the
merits of the possible establishment of a subsectoral free trade
arrangement with Canada on petrochemicals.
Moreover, the
Canadian chemical industry has proposed that any such
negotiations address only certain products in the petrochemical
subsector.
CMA is opposed to any chemical industry product or
subsectoral approach.
Instead, we believe that any tariff
negotiations with Canada, coupled as indicated above with
negotiations on non-tariff barriers, must address all chemicals
and related products.
To ensure the effectiveness of the tariff elimination
component of a free trade agreement with Canada, any such
agreement should require that all products eligible for duty-free
entry into the United. States under the agreement have a Canadian
value added level of at least 70 percent of the value of the
product.
The value of U.S. origin raw materials or other
components incorporated into a Canadian product in Canada should
be considered Canadian value added for purposes of the 70 percent
test.
CMA 038375
Moreover, CMA believes that a free trade agreement with
Canada should:
provide for the reimposition of duties in the •
event of non-fulfillment of agreement conditions; address oth r
issues, such as how temporary trade distortions caused by
currency fluctuations and injury to a domestic industry by
duty-free entry of products will be handled; and contain an
adequate and binding dispute settlement mechanism (the dispute
settlement provisions contained in the U.S./Israeli agreement are
not adequate in our opinion).
Finally, CMA believes that it is absolutely essential that
r
the U.S. Administration provide adequate and timely opportunities
for chemical industry input before undertaking any free trade
negotiations with Canada, as well as during any negotiation
process.
CMA urges the utilization of the Industry Sector
Advisory Committee (ISAC) for this process.
However, we believe
that other industry groups, such as our own Association, must
also be included in this consultative process.
CMA believes that, if the issues discussed in our comments
are considered by the United States Government before
negotiations with Canada begin and if they are adequately
addressed in any free trade agreement with Canada, then trade
benefits mutually advantageous to both countries are achievable
through such an agreement.
CMA 038376
CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION:
COMMENTS ON A BILATERAL FREE
TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEEN THE UNITED STATES
AND CANADA
INTRODUCTION
The United States and Canadian Governments are considering
the desirability of a bilateral free trade agreement between the
two countries.
As a part of this analysis, the United States
International Trade Commission (USITC) and the inter-agency Trade
policy Staff Committee (TPSC) are currently investigating the
probable economic effect of providing duty-free treatment for
selected imports from Canada.
The results of these
investigations are intended to assist the President in assessing
the impact of establishing bilateral free trade in selected
industry subsectors, including certain petrochemicals.
The Chemical Manufacturers Association wishes to make the
following comments on a bilateral free trade agreement between
the United States and Canada.
The Chemical Manufacturers
Association (CMA) is a nonprofit trade association whose member
companies represent more than 90 percent of the productive
capacity of basic industrial chemicals in the United States.
The comments contained in this paper are not directed to
aither the USITC or the TPSC investigation.
Rather, they present
issues which CMA believes must be addressed by the U.S.
Government prior to entering into any bilateral free trade
agreement with Canada.
CMA 038377
GENERAL COMMENTS
The United States and Canada are each other’s largest
trading partner.
The total trade between the two countries in
1984 equalled $113 billion.
Chemical trade represents a
substantial portion of this figure.
In 1984, Canadian chemical
exports to the United States were about $3.13 billion, and United
States chemical exports to Canada totalled $2.75 billion.
This
reflects a 1984 chemical trade balance of about $379 million in
The chemical industry of each country has substantial direct
investment in the other country.
In many cases, Canadian
subsidiaries of U.S. companies produce intermediate or finished
products, not only for the Canadian market, but also for the
United States and third country markets.
In addition, the strengths of the U.S. and Canadian chemical
industries complement each other.
Canada has a rich base in
natural resources, especially in hydrocarbons, with installed
capacity for large volumes of certain basic chemicals and inter­
mediates.
The United States has a highly developed basic
chemical and downstream chemical processing industry, as well as
capacity to produce a variety of commodity chemicals.

III. SPECIFIC COMMENTS
Any Bilateral Free Trade Agreement Must Confer Balanced
Benefits to Both the United States and Canada.
CMA believes that the benefits of any bilateral agreement
must be even-handed; one country must not benefit to the
detriment of the other.
The statutory authority.for such
agreements supports this contention.
Section 102 of the Trade
Act of 1974, as amended by Section 401 of the Trade and Tariff
Act of 1984,
indicates that such negotiations should be
conducted on the basis of mutuality.
Moreover, the legislative
history of the 1984 Act states the intention of Congress that
bilateral agreements of the sort proposed with Canada must be
"reciprocal and mutually advantageous.” —
$2112), as amended by Section 401(a) (2) of the Trade and Tariff
CMA 038379
Any Free Trade Agreement with Canada Must Address
Non-Tariff Barriers to Trade~
Negotiations on the Elimination of Preferential Canadian
Chemical Feedstock and Energy Policies and Foreign
Investment Restrictions Must be an Integral Part of Any Free
Trade Negotiations with Canada.
CMA believes that the negotiations between the United States
and Canada on a bilateral free trade agreement should not be
limited to the subject of tariff-cutting.
The elimination of
trade distortions caused by preferential Canadian chemical
feedstock and energy policies and by Canadian foreign investment
restrictions must also be adequately addressed in such
negotiations.
Furthermore/ we believe that the U.S. Gov rnment
must not commit itself to eliminating any tariffs prior to
obtaining Canadian agreement to eliminate the trade distorting
effects of these restrictive policies.
Ample support for the
inclusion of non-tariff barriers in such negotiations is found in
the Trade Act of 1974 and the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. —
Sections 102(a)/ 103 and 105 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19
CMA 038380
Canadian Raw -Material and Energy Policies
CMA believes that the internal energy policies implemented
under the Canadian National Energy Policy
(CNEP) have had an
adverse effect on market mechanisms in Canada and on Canadian
trade with the United States in energy-related products, such as
chemicals.
We understand that the CNEP is under review by the
Canadian government and is likely to be changed.
In any case, as
part of a bilateral free trade agreement, we urge that the United
States Government ensure that present and future Canadian
governments' feedstock supply, price, and access policies do not
serve as a barrier to otherwise fair competition.
This is necessary to avoid the creation, or perpetuation, of
an artificial advantage for the producers of one country over
those of the other.
Such an assurance is particularly important
to industries, such as the petrochemical industry, for which
feedstock pricing and availability are critical because the cost
of feedstocks represents the largest element of cost for many
petrochemical products.
If the trade distorting effects of the
Canadian governments' policies with respect to the supply and
price of, and access to, petrochemical feedstocks are not
neutralized, then those Canadian policies will largely determine
the conditions of competition in international trade in
petrochemicals between the United States and Canada, undermining
the workings of an open market system.
CMA 038381
Canadian Investment Policy
The United States Government must address differences in
investment policy between the United States and Canada to ensure
that U.S. companies wishing to invest in the Canadian chemical
industry are not subject to different or more stringent
requirements than are Canadian investors in Canada.
In 1983# a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
panel found the Canadian Foreign Investment Review Act (FIRA) to
be in violation of GATT Article III because FIRA made approval
to
e
invest in Canada contingent upon a foreign investor's acceptance
of often onerous performance requirements to which domestic
Canadian investors were not subject.
We understand that the Canadian Government has begun to
administer FIRA in a less restrictive manner and that the
Canadian Parliament has passed the "Investment Canada Act" as
FIRA's replacement. —
while this new legislation is supposed to
liberalize the requirements imposed on foreign investors, s v ral
restrictions will remain, especially on foreign acquisitions of
existing Canadian companies.
It remains to be seen how the new
Act will be implemented.
—^General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Report of the
Panel, Canada-Administration of the Foreign Investment Review
—Introduced in the House of Commons on December 7, 1984.
CMA 038382
In any event, CMA urges the United States Government to seek
the elimination of discriminatory Canadian investment
restrictions, other than those dealing with national security,
prior to finalizing a tariff-cutting agreement with Canada.
Other Non-Tariff Trade Barriers, Such as Inadequate
Protection of Intellectual Property Rights, Should Also be
Considered in Any Free Trade Negotiations Between the United
States and Canada.
There is growing recognition in the United States and abroad
that the effective protection of intellectual property rights is
essential to increased innovation and productivity and is a vital
part of international trade decisions.
Provisions aimed at
encouraging such protection in other countries are contained in
the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, —^
the topic is being included
in numerous bilateral trade and investment negotiations, and
efforts are underway by some industry groups to have intellectual
property rights included in a new round of multilateral trade
negotiations.
In this context, CMA urges the United States Government to
address the issue of protection of intellectual property rights
as part of any free trade negotiations with Canada.
Canada has
traditionally recognized the importance of providing such
and Tari7l“Acto7 1984; 98 Stat. 3001, 3005, 3019 and 3021.
CMA 038383
protection.
However, some problem areas remain, for example, in
the pharmaceutical field.
We believe that a free trade agreement
with Canada should include a resolution of these issues, as well
as provisions eliminating any other non-tariff trade barriers
that may exist.
The Tariff Elimination Components of a Free Trade
Agreement with Canada Must be Ef?ective.
The Tariff Elimination Components of A Bilateral
Free Trade Aqreement~^etween the United Statesand Canada
sKould Include All Chemicals and Related Products and Not be
Restricted to Chemical Industry Subsectorsor Specific
Products.
A key issue in the U.S.-Canada negotiations is whether
import duties or tariffs will be eliminated "across the board" or
only on specific industry sectors, subsectors, or products.
CMA is opposed to any chemical industry product or subs ctoral
approach.
Instead, we believe that tariff negotiations with
Canada must address all chemicals and related products.
We
believe such broader negotiations offer greater potential for
mutual trade benefits.
CMA 038384
Any Free Trade Agreement with Canada Should Require That All
products Eligible for Duty-Free Entry Into the United States
Under~the Agreement Must Have a Canadian Value Added Level inclucTinqr the Value of U.S. Origin Components- of at Least
70 Percent of the Value of the Product.
A minimum level of "Canadian value added" must be a
condition for duty-free entry into the United States under a
bilateral free trade agreement with Canada.
This criterion would
be fully consistent with the goal of enhanced U.S./Canadian trade
and would help to prevent potential abuses of a special trade
relationship through transshipment practices.
The value added
threshold must be high enough to prevent products of third
countries being passed through Canada to the United States after
only formulation or minor finishing operations have been
performed in Canada.
CMA urges that the minimum domestic Canadian value added b
set at 70 percent of the appraised value of the product at the
time of entry, rather them the 35 percent required under the
Generalized System of Preferences, the Caribbean Basin Economic
Recovery Act, and the proposed bilateral free trade agreement
with Israel.
A higher percentage is necessary in an agreement
with Canada because Canada is not a developing country and should
not be given the liberal domestic value added requirements that
have been granted as a concession to such countries.
In
addition, CMA recommends that the value of U.S. origin raw
materials or other components incorporated into a Canadian
product in Canada be considered to be Canadian value added for
purposes of the 70 percent test to promote bilateral trade.
CMA 038386
A Free Trade Agreement with Canada Should Provide for the
Mandatory^ Reimposition of Duties in the"Event of
Non-Fulfillment of the Conditions of the Agreement.
Any U.S./Canada bilateral free trade agreement should
include a "snap-back" provision under which United States import
duties eliminated under the agreement automatically return to
column 1 rates if the conditions of the free trade agreement are
no longer fulfilled.
For example, if investment restrictions
were reimposed by Canada or if Canada imposed a new non-tariff
barrier to U.S. exports, then the duties on imports from Canada
should snap-back.
Free Trade Negotiations with Canada Should Also Address
Other Issues, Such as How Temporary Trade Distortions Caused
by Currency Fluctuations and Injury to a Domestic Industry
by Dutv-^ree Entry of Products Will be Handled, to Avoid
Impairment of the Benefits Under Any Bilateral Free Trade
Agreement.
Two difficult subjects that CMA believes must also b
addressed in the context of bilateral free trade negotiations
with Canada are how to handle temporary trade distortions caused
by currency fluctuations and what to do if a domestic industry is
injured by the duty-free entry of products under an agreement.
Consideration should be given to imposition of a surcharge to
correct the temporary trade distortions in the first instance and
to imposition of temporary safeguard duties to eliminate the
injury in the second.
In this regard, CMA assumes the U.S.
unfair trade statutes will continue to apply to imports fr m
Canada.
CMA 038386
Any Bilateral Free Trade Agreement with Canada Should
Contain an Adequate and Binding Dispute Settlement
Mechanism.
CMA believes that any bilateral free trade agreement with
Canada should contain procedures for the settlement of disputes
between Canada and the United States that arise under the
agreement.
We do not believe that the procedures contained in
the proposed U.S./Israeli agreement are adequate for this
purpose.
Instead, we recommend that dispute settlement procedures in
any U.S./Canada agreement:
settlement of disputes;
provide for a rapid and effectiv
contain mechanisms for a binding
decision in the event of a stalemate; and, most importantly,

The U.S. Government Should Consult with the U.S.

As mandated by the Trade Act of 1974, and reaffirmed in th

widespread perception that the ISACs were not advised or
consulted adequately in the course of developing the U.S./Israel
Free Trade Agreement nor in earlier and subsequent U.S.
Government discussions with Mexico which led to the signing o£
the U.S./Mexican Subsidies Agreement.
CMA strongly urges the
U.S. Government to avail itself fully of this mechanism for
eliciting private sector input on a timely basis if any
consultations on a U.S./Canada bilateral agreement proceed.
Moreover, we believe that appropriate mechanisms must exist
to allow for additional industry input, such as from CMA and
other trade associations, into any such negotiations so that all
significant considerations can be addressed prior to any
commitments having been made.
CONCLUSION
CMA believes that, if the issues raised in this paper are
considered by the United States Government before negotiations
with Canada begin and are adequately addressed in any free trade
agreement with Canada, then trade benefits mutually advantageous
to both countries are achievable through such an agreement.

REVIEW OF CMA GROUNDWATER PROGRAM
AMD
PROPOSED POLICY ON GROUNDWATER PROTECTION
1
I
1
This presentation is intended to review the development of CMA's
groundwater program and to request approval of one new element of OiA's evolving
groundwater policy.
Groundwater is an important natural resource. It has many and varied uses
including drinking water supplies, crop irrigation, livestock watering and
industrial water supplies. Approximately 50% of all Americans obtain all or
part of their drinking water from groundwater sources.
Recently groundwater issues have come to the forefront. Many groundwater
issues are or soon will be before Congress, EPA, state legislatures and
regulatory agencies, and on the agendas of environmental groups, industry groups,
and consensus organizations *
o
Senator Durenberger is currently holding oversight hearings
on groundwater. Senator Durenberger will introduce
groundwater legislation in September 1985 which may
significantly affect chemical industry operations (siting,
transportation, product use, waste disposal).
o
In 1985, 135 groundwater related bills were introduced in 25
states. Most bills contain provisions which significantly
impact chemical industry operations. An even greater level
of state activity is expected in 1986.
o
Some states, such as Wisconsin and Florida have enacted
detailed legislation for groundwater management programs.
o
EPA recently developed and is moving to implement a groundwater protection strategy.
o
Consensus groups, such as the Conservation foundation and the
National Water Alliance have formed task groups to address
the issues.
o
other trade associations such as NACA, SOCMA and NEDA are
developing policy statements.
o
Bivironmsntal groups such as NRDC, EDF and EPI (Environmental
Policy Institute) are addressing the issue in various forums.
CMA 038389
CMA Objective
To achieve a beneficial balance between chemical industry operations and
protection of human health and aquatic resources.
Elements and Status of CMA Groundwater Policy
CMA is developing a comprehensive groundwater management policy which
addresses federal and state legislative and regulatory responsibilities. CMA's
position on the federal/state split continues to be that:
o
states should have responsibility for defining. Implementing
and enforcing groundwater management programs.
o
the federal government should provide guidance, technical
transfer and funds to aid states in their efforts.
CMA's groundwater management policy will address all critical aspects of
the groundwater issue. These aspects include groundwater standards, monitoring,
use classification, groundwater protection and product handling. CMA actions t
date are summarized in Table I.
Proposed Groundwater Protection Policy
The proposed groundwater protection policy is before the Board of Directors
for approval. This policy states that groundwater is an important natural
resource that must be protected.
States have the leadership role in protecting and managing this resource,
and should act on these responsibilities by developing and implementing
groundwater management progrmas. Groundwater quality protection programs are an
integral part of broader groundwater management program.
As states develop their protection progrmas, CMA recamends that states
consider instituting requirements for appropriate facility design and operating
practices developed by each facility that will minimise the release of
pollutants (groundwater protection practices).
Also, CMA recognises that states may choose to institute the f llowing
practices as part of a groundwater management prograi a) a groundwater
withdrawal program to protect groundwater quality, b) land use planning in areas
where the potential for adverse imp acts from groundwater contain stion from
future activities are significant} e) a permit progrma for point source
discharges to groundwater where such discharges are not already controlled under
existing regulations*

Description of am Position and Status
Groundwatar Standards
States should maintain groundwater at
existing quality or at a quality necessary
to maintain use, provided that standards
are applied where groundwater is with­
drawn for use* The federal goveriment
should develop use-based criteria s
states can set reasonable standards*
This policy was approved by the Board
of Directors in June 1985.

Groundwater Monitoring
This position addresses when, where and
how to monitor groundwater to- insure
that desired groundwater quality is not
impaired. The position calls for tech­
nically sound methods for monitoring
and requirements for technical
competence of those performing the
monitoring. This policy was approved
by the Board of Directors in June 1985.
Alternative Supplies of
Drinking Water
This policy describes the process a
governmental unit should use to deter­
mine when alternative drinking water
supplies should be provided. This is
an elaboration of current Board
approved Superfund policy.
Sols Source Aquifer
This policy exports restrictions on
activities over sole source aquifers
to prevent groundwater contmnatlon
since the aquifer is the sole source
of drinking water. The current policy
is an elaboration of Board approved
Use Classification
Our current policy states that groundwater should be maintained at a quality
necessary to support current and future
uses. The position was approved by the
Board of Directors in 1982. Re-evalua­
tion and appropriate modification f
the policy is underway.
Product Handling
This policy should address product
handling and distribution procedures to
prevent contamination of groundwater.
Plana for policy development are
underway.

PROPOSED CMA POSITION
PROTECTION OF GROUNDWATER QUALITY
introduction
Groundwater is an important natural resource that must be protsctsd.
CMA
advocates protsction of groundwater quality, through managamant of tha resourca
y- «xiitin9 quality or at a quality nacassary to maintain dasignatad uses.
Groundwater quality should ba dataminad where water is withdrawn for usa.
This document provides concapts for stata groundwitar quality protaction
?cogrsns. Protaction programs ars just ona aspact of ccmprahansiva groundwatar
gjnagamant progrmas. Tha concapts addrassad in this papar apply to a wide
cross-section of private and public activities (industrial, domestic, municipal,
agricultural, etc.) that may affect groundwatar.
tor industrial activities, these recommendations cover manufacturing and
uicillary facilities other than waste disposal operations which have tha
potential to contaminate groundwatar. Waste disposal operations are already
covered by existing state and federal statutes, regulations and programs.
Decisions about managing groundwatar resources have historically and
appropriately been the responsibility of state and local governments. In view
of tha localized nature of groundwatar use and the land use considerations tied
so closely to groundwater management, states continue to be best suited to
develop and implement groundwater management program. Some states have
designed or are in the process of designing programs tailored to meet their
specific needs and considerations. CMA encourages all states to develop such
program.
In developing groundwater quality protection programs, CMA believes that
states should consider instituting performance requirements for each facility
that will minimise the release of pollutants (groundwater protection practices
Also, CMA realizes that statss may choose to institute one or more of the
following practices as part of the groundwater management progrAt a) a
groundwater withdrawal program to protect groundwater quality; b) land use
planning in areas where the potential for adverse Impacts from groundwatar
contamination from future activities are significant; and c) a permit program
for point source discharges to groundwater where such dischargus are not already
controlled under existing regulations.
Sroundwatsr Protection Practices
The institution of requirements for appropriata facility design and
derating practices (GPP's) is an acceptable and appropriate means of protecting
groundwater quality and of minimising the potential for groundwater dischargee
CMA 038392
from ill source*. Such practices should be developed by the affected facility,
be implemented on a facility-specific basis and include the concept of
hydrogeologic vulnerability. Surveillance programs should be instituted, where
necessary, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the specific protection practice.
In, addition, a GPP should include educational and training programs for those
responsible for implementation.
GPP1s should address current and planned activities and should be
documented. They should also include any necessary plots, plans, drawings or
maps. In addition, the GPP plan should be modified whenever changes at a
facility materially increase the potential for significant releases of
pollutants or where actual releases indicate the plan is inadequate.
Where states opt to include GPP‘s as part of their groundwater quality
protection program, such practices could include an inspection provision and
trigger mechanism for more detailed plan review when discharges occur.
The federal government should assist states in developing GPP requirements
by providing guidance and technical assistance and by creating the opportunity
for information exchange. This would assist states in determining the most
effective approaches consistent with their specific needs.
Absent regulatory requirements, groundwater protection practices are still
an appropriate and necessary procedure for those whose land surface activities
could affect groundwater quality.
Other state Considerations
Improper withdrawal of quantities of water can affect groundwater quality
by causing saltwater intrusion, undesirable changes in groundwater flow

are exposed to brake fluids where TGE concentrations range from 60-80% by
volume.
Proposed testing for each ether includes:
1) a 90-day rat dermal
study with satellite neurotoxicity testing; 2) dermal developmental
toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, including a study of behavioral
teratology in the rat; 3) Tier One mutagenicity testing and possibly
higher; 4) dermal rat and mouse oncogenicity studies (triggered by
positive mutagenicity); and, 5) a reproduction study in rats if signs of
reproductive organ toxicity are observed in the subchronic study.
The Glycol Ethers Panel is considering alternative testing proposals
to the EPA program.
The Panel will initiate a dermal limit test study on
the TGEs this month.
An in vitro skin absorption study on the compounds
is also planned.
Hydroquinone.
Results from a developmental toxicity study of rats
exposed to hydroquinone were submitted to EpA.
Testing was conducted at
Eastman Kodak's Health and Environmental Laboratories.
Ketones.
EPA's Office of Toxic Substances has issued a final rule
requiring testing of mesityl oxide under TSCA Section 4(a).
The Agency is

requiring a mutagenicity battery and 90-day subchronic study.
A positive
result in one of the mutagenicity tests would trigger higher-tiered
mutagenicity testing and an oncogenicity study.
All manufacturers,
including manufacturers of MO as a non-isolated intermediate, and
processors are subject to the test rule.
EPA also considers exposure to
MO in pesticide formulation to be a TSCA concern.
Concurrent with the publication of the final rule, EPA issued a
proposed rule on testing guidelines for the research required in the test
rule.
Comments are due to EPA by February 3, 1986.
The Ketones Panel will meet this month to review the final rule and
develop comments in response to the proposed test standards.
Lubricant Additives.
An organizational meeting of companies
interested in forming a Lubricant Additives Program was held at CMA on
October 22, 1985.
Attendees included members of an ad hoc group of
lubricant additives manufacturers who organized under CMA's Distribution
Committee to address forthcoming pollution control regulations by the
International Maritime Organization.
The group’s interests expanded to
discussion of the point where sponsorship of environmental effects testing
to support proper shipping classification of the additives.
CMA has
responded favorably to the request to establish a Special Program.
The
Lubricant Additives Panel will sponsor an aquatic toxicity testing program
and incorporate other activities of the ad hoc group.
Meetings of the
Panel and Environmental Research Task Group are scheduled this month.
Methylenedianlline.
The MDA Panel sponsored a one-day seminar for
MDA user representatives.
The seminar resulted in general support for
expanding the Panel to serve as the central coordination organization for
industry participation in the upcoming regulatory negotiations on MDA.
Several key trade associations with an Interest in MDA decided to join the
Panel;
National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA); Suppliers of
Advanced Composite Materials (SACMA); and The Society of the Plastics
Industry (SPI).
The MDA Panel submitted comments in response to two Federal Register
notices regarding the establishment of a Federal Advisory Committee on
MDA.
The Panel submitted the nominations of Roger Daniels (Dow), Ron Lane
Fensterheim (CMA) to the Committee.
The Panel also
endorsed the nominations submitted by NEMA and SACMA.
The Panel informed OSHA that if all bf the industry nominees cannot
be accommodated, OSHA should not select the industry nominees to the
Advisory Committee.
Rather, OSHA should identify the number of seats to
be filled by MDA producers and users and allow the industry to determine
how the seats will be allocated.
Octylphenol.
CMA signed a contract with ABC Laboratories for conduct

of a chronic effects study of octylphenol in the rainbow trout.
The study
is being conducted as the last part of a TSCA Section 4 negotiated testing
agreement with EPA.
Phosgene.
The Phosgene Panel was given a private tour of the
Department of Energy's new Liquified Gaseous Fuels Spill Test Facility.
The facility, located about 75 miles from Las Vegas, has been established
on a user -fee basis to study the dynamics of accidental releases of
hazardous liquids.
The Panel is exploring the feasibility of sponsoring
research on air dispersion model validation and mitigation devices.
Phthalate Esters.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission released t>e
final report of its Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel (CHAP) on
di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in children's products.
The CHAP report
concluded that while DEHP is an animal carcinogen, it is not genotoxic
(does not damage DMA) and the most likely mechanism of action involves a
threshold phenomenon.
In addition, the CHAP concluded that existing
exposure data are inadequate to permit an accurate estimate of risk.
Finally, the CHAP suggested that additional research is necessary to
accurately assess effects of DEHP on humans.
Following release of the report, the Commission met on December 19,
1985 to consider regulatory action of DEHP in children's products.
The
Toy Manufacturers of America proposed a voluntary standard on DEHP levels
in pacifiers.
The Commission agreed to pursue the voluntary standard and
meet again in March 1986 to review the progress of standard development.
The Phthalate Esters Panel will also participate in the standard
development process.
The Phthalate Esters Panel has formed a new work group, as part of
the Panel's FDA Task Group.
The new Exposure Work Group will develop a
program that will supplement FDA food analysis activities concerning
phthalates.
The Society of the Plastics Industry will actively
participate in this effort.
The FDA is analyzing milk and beer samples to
determine representative DEHP levels.
The Exposure work Group has
proposed a program that will test three food types:
milk, cheese and
meat.
Six locations in the United States will be selected, and six
products in each food type will be collected from every location.
DEHP
levels will be measured in each food sample.
FDA agreed to participate by
identifying the appropriate food brands and locations for collection.
If
FDA concurs totally with the proposal, testing should begin in February
1986.
The Phthalate Esters Panel filed comments on the TSCA Section 4
Proposed Test Rule on butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) which were prepared in
conjunction with the CMA Environmental Management Committee.
Since BBP is
also on EPA's Priority Pollutant List, the Agency is requiring under this
rule all the testing necessary to develop a Water Quality Criteria
Standard,
The Panel commented that the existing data base on BBP "may
Page
51
CMA 0386S6
present an unreasonable risk of injury." The Panel also feels that EPA
cannot use data needs for the Clean Water Act to justify testing under
Section 4 of TSCA.
Finally, the Panel's comments point out that the EPA
requirements for water Quality Criteria are excessive, and that the
standard test battery should be reduced to reflect the state-of-the-art in
environmental testing.
The Panel's comments were also presented to EPA at
a public meeting on the proposed rule on November 22.
The Panel and the
EMC will continue to work with the Water Office to develop a more
appropriate testing approach.
The Phthalate Esters Panel also provided EPA with comments on the
final report on "A Ranking System for 307(a) List of Priority Pollutants."
dated August 1985.
The report will be the basis for potential removal of
chemicals from EPA's Water Priority Pollutant List.
The industry has a
vital interest in the content and eventual application of the report since
any chemical can be listed or delisted as a priority pollutant.
EPA plans to announce its final procedures in May 1986.
Polychlorinated Biphenyls.
The Panel is continuing efforts towards
the development of a national standar4 for addressing PCB spills.
Various
meetings were held with representatives from the National Electrical
Manufacturers Association, the Edison Electric institute, the Natural
Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund.
The Panel has begun developing its strategy for addressing EPA's
initiatives to bring PCB regulations into RCRA.
The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Panel's motion to
intervene in the lawsuit brought against EPA's new regulations on the use
of PCBs in transformers.
The petition was granted despite EPA's motion
opposing the intervention.
Rubber Additives.
The Panel has agreed to conduct a comparative
metabolism study of mercaptobenzothiazole and mercaptobenzothiazole
disulfide.
The study will be conducted at Southern Research Institute.
The Panel is in the process of preparing comments in response to EPA's
proposed TSCA Section 4 test rule on MBT.
Titanium Dioxide.
The Panel last month met with officials from the
National cancer Institute to discuss the Institute's proposed
epidemiologic study of titanium dioxide workers.
NCI will address the
Panel's concerns in the report that it will submit to the Board of
Scientific Counselors for approval of the study.
The NCI Board will meet
in March 1986, and if the approval is granted, the study will begin by the
end of the year.
The TD industry plans to fully cooperate with NCI during
the conduct of the study.
Vinylidene Chloride.

The
Water Additives.
The Panel was formed in late 1985 to evaluate the
National Sanitation Foundation's regulatory program for direct and
indirect potable water additives.
The Panel is preparing a position paper
on organic polyelectrolyte potable water additives.
The Panel will
participate in the January NSF meeting designed to inform the public on
how the regulations will be established.
Zinc Dialkyl Dithiophosphates.
The ZDDP Panel recently decided to
sunset after four years of conducting an active research and advocacy
program.
The ZDDP program was organized in 1981.
Participating companies
sponsored a three-phase research program designed to study the mutagenic
potential and possible reproductive effects associated with exposure to
this class of oil additives.
Seven producers and one user sponsored the
$400,000 program.
Research results from Panel-sponsored research were shared with EPA
and the Interagency Testing Committee (ITC).
These studies were deciding
factors in the ITC decision not to recommend ZDDPs for further health or
environmental effects testing.

A continuing
discussion with the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers
Federations (CEFIC) and the Japan Chemical Industry Association
(JCIA) has resulted in agreement to meet with both JCIA and CEFIC
in the United States during the first six months of 1986.

Grassroots Activities
The Grassroots Program continues to support the Washington based
lobbying efforts on Superfund reauthorizatibn.
Most of this work is being

dona through the network of constitutent contacts developed over the last
two years.
As Superfund legislation moved through the House and Senate, the
Grassroots Program continued to request letters and telephone calls from
constituents to legislators.
The message delivered to the legislators
continued to reflect the latest legislative developments.
The response to request for letters, telephone calls, and visits was
outstanding.
It appears that most companies made every effort to contact
a maximum number of Congressmen.
Follow-up letters thanking those Congressmen who supported CMA were
also requested.
Each Grassroot Manager was given the voting record on the
major amendments debate by the full House.
As needed, the Grassroots Program will lobby Congressmen and Senators
involved in the Conference Committee on Superfund.
In January a letter from the CMA Chairman of the Board George Sella
of American Cyanamid will be sent to each CMA member company requesting
increased and new participation in the Grassroots Program.
There will be a meeting of existing and new Grassroots Managers in
February 1986.
This meeting is designed to introduce all Grassroots
Managers to the Grassroots Program.
Background information on the new
Grassroots issues of the Clean Air Act and Groundwater will also be
discussed.
Following the February meeting, companies' Grassroots Managers will
be asked to identify constituents living in key congressional districts or
states.
These contacts will act as the coordinator of CMA Grassroots
activities in their area.
The Grassroots Program also plans to develop coalition efforts with
other chemical associations, other industry associations, and state
chemical councils wherever possible to lobby on the Clean Air Act and
Groundwater issues.

Insurance.
The Office has hosted a series of meetings with insurance
representatives of several member companies which has culminated in a
proposal to the Executive Committee that CjiA establish a Special Committee
on Insurance,
The two primary purposes of the Special Committee would be
to recommend to the Executive Committee CMA advocacy positions with the
government on insurance specific issues and to host a biannual open forum
for member insurance representatives to share information on the
availability of insurance to the industry.
The Office has also represented the Association at meetings of
various Washington based organizations on the related issues of insurance
availability and liability reform.
Government - Industry - Environmentalists Meeting on Alternatives to
Litigation.
The Office represented the Association at an October meeting
at the Ausable Club in New York, of senior lawyers and other officials of
EPA, the Department of Justice and several environmental organizations and
other individuals knowledgeable about alternatives to litigation.
This
first two-day, exploratory meeting, hosted in part by the Environmental
Law Institute, permitted the attendees to share information on the history
and disposition of their respective organizations to pursue alternatives
to litigation.
Specifically identified as an arena worth the attention of the respective
organizations was litigation alternatives in Superfund generally, and
Superfund enforcement specifically.
A second meeting is scheduled for
January at Belmont House in Maryland where topics for discussion will
include citizen enforcement of the environmental laws and potentials for
negotiated rulemaking.
Communications
A special task group of the Communications Committee met to discuss
the issue of Risk communication and the impact of risk perception on
public demands for government intervention.
The Community Information Programs Task Group conducted an interview
program with the National Association of County Agricultural Agents at its
annual meeting.
Five industry representatives from five member companies
taped 11 hours with 22 newspapers and 39 radio stations with an estimated
audience of more than one million.
The task group placed Charles M.

background
with the promotion of Mr. Raymond J. O'Bryan to the position of
Controller at CMA, it is necessary that Mr. O'Bryan's name replace that
of Mr. Agnew as an authorized signer on the Association's commercial
checking account.
The addition of Mr. Van Vlack, the Corporate
Secretary, as a fourth authorized signer should facilitate processing
and reviewing disbursements while maintaining good internal control.
RECOMMENDATION
That the Association's commercial checking account at National
Savings and Trust (No. 0210-44030) may be drawn on by check signed by
any two of the following:
Robert A. Roland, President; Gary C.
Herrman, Vice President-Treasurer; Charles W. Van Vlack, Corporate
Secretary; or Raymond J. O'Bryan, Controller.
The facsimile signature
of Robert A. Roland may be used to countersign checks drawn by, Robert
A. Roland, Gary C. Herrman, Charles W. Van Vlack or Raymond J. O'Bryan
(not to exceed $10,000 per check).
ACTION REQUESTED
Approval of Recommendation and Resolution A.
BACKGROUND
The current procedures requiring the manual signature of the
President or Treasurer for disbursements from the Association's imprest
payroll account are burdensome and time consuming.
Adequate control
already exists to permit use of a facsimile signature for such
disbursements.
RECOMMENDATION
That the Association's payroll checking account at National
Savings and Trust (NO. 0120-43099) may be drawn on only by check signed
by one of the following:
Robert A. Roland, President; Gary C. Herrman,
vice President-Treasurer; or Robert A. Roland/facsimile.
ACTION REQUESTED
Approval of recommendation and Resolution B.
BACKGROUND
Through recently passed legislation, i.e., the Tax Equity and
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), the Deficit Reduction Act
(DEFRA), and the Retirement Equity Act (REA), congress has imposed
numerous additional requirements for continued tax qualification of
pension and profit-sharing plans.
The IRS has not yet issued regu­
lations implementing all th new legislation and regulations that have
been issued have not yet been finalized,
congress also may enact new
CMA 038661
f
2
legislation changing the requirements for maintenance of tax qualified
status.
Because it is as yet unclear what requirements must be met in
order to maintain tax-qualified status under the new tax laws, irs
may request additional amendments to the Plans during the determination
letter process.
Additional amendments may also be needed to comply
with any future changes in the tax laws.
Accordingly, an expeditious
method of amending the 401(h) Plan and the Pension Plan to maintain tax
qualified status is needed.
At its October 18, 1985 meeting, the CMA Employee Benefits
Committee directed staff and pension counsel to prepare a resolution
for Board approval to expand the authority of the President to make
such changes.
RECOMMENDATION
That the President be granted authority, on advice of pension
counsel, to authorized amendments to CMA's qualified plans to the
1
extent necessary to maintain their qualified status.
Such amendments
would be subsequently, reported to the Employee Benefits Committee and
Board for Review.

PROPOSED MTN POSITION
BACKGROUND
The Administration has moved strongly to counter Congressional
anger about import competition and foreign markets closed to U.S.
exports.
The President proposed on September 23 a long list of things
he will do administratively and requests he will make of the Congress
for legislation.
Among the proposals will be a request for
authorization of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations
(MTN's) under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
Important sections of the business conanunity and the farmers have
been pressuring the Administration for such broad scale bargaining for
several years.
It is essential, they believe, to resolve serious
trade problems they have on a worldwide basis.
In anticipation of
this, the President's Trade Representative has strongly promoted a new
MTN (like the Kennedy Round of the 60's and Tokyo round of the 70's)
with other countries.
It now appears that enough GATT members agree
and the President needs to prove his commitment by obtaining
Congressional approval to proceed.
Key bills in the Senate and House
have an MTN authorization provision.
They will be taken up early in
1986.
RECOMMENDATION
The CMA International Trade Consnittee seeks to emphasize three
issues in a new MTN:
intellectual property rights investment policy
and tariff cutting.
With a position already approved by the Board on
the first two issues, approval of a tariff cutting policy was
requested the Board on September 10.
The proposal was tabled, without
prejudice, to allow the ITC to revise it after reviewing comments by
Board members.
The resulting, proposed policy and statement of principles is
attached.
It calls for a sound U.S.
negotiating policy, a better
GATT dispute settlement procedure, limited tariff cutting, and
resolution of investment and intellectual property rights difficulties
in other countries.
A copy of the full, recosnended ITC policy is a attached.
ACTION REQUIRED - Approval of attached position.

STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES
CONCERNING
UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION IN A
NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS (MTN)
UNDER THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT)
In 1986, the United States and other GATT signatories are expected to
enter into a new Round of MTN in an effort to further expand world
trade.
CMA believes the new Round should address a number of issues which are
crucial to the long range competitive position of the U.S. chemical
industry.
The emphasis should not be on simply cutting tariffs, but
rather on efforts to eliminate existing trade barriers.
These trade
barriers include foreign market access, certain tariffs, trade
distorting foreign investment practices, ineffective protection of
intellectual property rights, and the lack of an effective
international discipline for settling disputes related to
international trading rules.
The attached statement of principles for U.S. participation in the
new Round addresses each of these issues.

STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES
CONCERNING
UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION IN A NEW ROUND
OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS (MTN)
UNDER THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT)
U.S. NEGOTIATING POLICY
The new round of MTN must foster the development of sound trading and
investment practices.
U.S. participation in the MTN should include
as priority objectives the elimination of trade distorting practices
and the expansion of U.S. export opportunities.
The reduction of
U.S. tariff rates should not be among the primary U.S. negotiating
objectives for a new MTN,'
The international trade interests of the United States should be given
consideration at least equal to foreign policy concerns in negotiating
agreements during the MTN.
Foreign policy concerns* other than those
of a national security nature, should not effect decisions on U.S.
trade policy.
Adequate and timely opportunities should be provided for U.S.
chemical industry input and review during the process of establishing
negotiating objectives as well as during the negotiations themselves.
Ample opportunity should also be provided for the private sector to
comment, and for Congress to debate and amend any tentative agreements
made in the negotiating process, before the negotiated agreements are
submitted to the Congress for final’approval.
The MTN authority should not restrict the President from conducting
separate trade negotiations with other countries during the MTN.
In
addition, the Administration should not impair the implementation and
timely and aggressive resolution of actions brought under U.S. trade
remedy laws during the MTN.
GATT DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES
GATT dispute settlement procedures must be improved to include
binding, time-certain requirements for the resolution of disagreements
on issues covered by GATT rules.
Resolution of disputes already taken
to GATT should be the first step in this process.

FOREIGN MARKET ACCESS
GATT signatory countries should be required to grant U.5. exporters
fair access to their markets without unreasonable barriers or
conditions, in exchange for their retaining relatively free access to
TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS
i
Although the emphasis of a new Round should not be on tariff cutting,
the reduction or even elimination of tariffs on certain chemical
products may be appropriate, while reductions of tariffs on certain
other chemical products may impose an undue burden on U.S.
manufacturers.
Any reductions which are proposed should, therefore,
be well-justified.
In the interest of reaching a balanced and equitable trade and tariff
agreement, the United States should negotiate changes in chemical
tariffs only on the basis of request lists, rather than imposing
formula cuts across the board, or automatically eliminating tariffs
below certain levels.
Also, any U.S. plan to reduce or eliminate chemical tariffs should
include provisions enabling affected industries to obtain exceptions
for import sensitive products.
In addition, reduction or elimination of chemical tariffs should not
be offered in exchange for concessions in non-chemical sectors.
These conditions should be included in any legislation authorizing
U.S. participation in the MTN, and specifically in legislative
language providing tariff negotiating authority for a new MTN Round.
FOREIGN INVESTMENT PRACTICES
A GATT code on foreign investment should be negotiated.
Such a code
should be based on national treatment for foreign investments and
should ensure the elimination or substantial reduction of
trade-distorting foreign investment practices, including!
o
prohibitions or restrictions on foreign investment
in certain economic sectors, such as chemicals
i
CMA 038666
o
screening of foreign investment proposals by
government agencies and limitations on the amounts
and percentages of equity that can be owned by
foreigners
o
performance requirements, including mandated local
purchase of equipment, supplies and services, and the
share of production which must be dedicated to exports
o
limitations on royalties and licensing
o
limitations on repatriation of earnings.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
U.S. negotiators should seek binding cosnitments from foreign
governments not to use inadequate intellectual property laws to
distort international trade.
As part of these commitments, agreements
should be negotiated not only to improve the protection afforded
patents, trademarks and copyrights, but also to improve the protection
afforded in practice to proprietary or confidential information and
trade secrets so that foreign nationals operating in other countries
may exercise and obtain enforcement of their intellectual property
rights in those countries.

CMA POSITION ON THE
reauthorization
op
the
hazardous
materials
TRANSPORTATION ACT
problem
The federal government has been losing the strong central authority
to regulate the movement of hazardous materials*
An increasing
number of state and local rules now restrict the free flow of these
commodities.
Such restrictions are manifested in many different
forms, including:
permits, routing, prenotification, equipment
specifications, driver licensing and hazard identification.
In exchange for giving up their right to impose local fees to support state
and local response capabilities to transportation emergencies in­
volving hazardous materials and other operation requirements, state
and local governments are demanding funding to improve their response
to transportation incidents involving hazardous materials.
Qbj active
Strengthen the HMTA to give DOT the ability to quickly review and rule
on local and state ordinances that impede the interstate movement
of goods*
Improve the ability of communities to plan for and
respond to hazardous materials transportation emergencies,
such
improvements should not be funded with a new •transportation
superfund", but rather should take into account private initiatives
such as NCRIC and CAER to respond to state and local needs.
Background
The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA) was originally
passed in 1974, and reauthorized in l$78 and again in 1982.
In the
last round of hearings on the HMTA reauthorisation, industry pressed
for national uniformity of regulations.
This was strongly opposed by
representatives of state and local government unless industry agreed
to address their concerns about local emergency response
capabilities.As a result. Congress refused to take a substantive
position addressing industry's concerns, or those of state/local
government*
Following the 1982 hearings a coalition of industry and
state and local representatives was formed to forge consensus
modifications to the HMTA that preserve the industry's interest in the
free flow of commodities between states and that address the needs of
state/local jurisdictions to respond adequately to hazardous materials
emergencies*
Unfortunately this Coalition adopted the position that a
special fund based on an industry tax should be included in the HMTA
t
pay for training and equipment for state/ local hazardous materials
•a rgency response teams.
The fund was estimated at $20 million
CMA 038668
dollars but chat is unrealistically low if equipment is included in
the fund objectives,
we are concerned that the new taxes would also
be directed at the "deep pockets" rather than the whole hazardous
materials transportation eoanunity*
We are also concerned that soae
states or localities would refuse to accept aoney froa a federal fund
and elect to initiate their own tax on industry.
Currently, the fund concept is supported by this "Uniformity
Coalition", the National Hazardous Materials Technical Advisory
Coaaittee (an advisory coaaittee to DOT), the API, the Aaerican
Trucking Association , the National Association of Towns and Town­
ships and the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The position
taken by shipper and carrier supporters is that a "saall federal
fund" would be better than sany state and local fees.
t
Recommendations
j
t
support reauthorization of the HMTA in this Congress.
The re­
authorization should strengthen the authority of DOT in preempting
local and state ordinances that impede the flow of hazardous
materials through fees, bans, prenotifieation, or unreasonable routing
restrictions.
At the same time we would support efforts to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal government in
providing training for local agencies to respond to hazardous
materials emergencies*
The federal program should recognize the
contribution of voluntary industry efforts.
Oppose the institution of another fund to provide training and
equipment for emergency responders on the basis that the training
is generally available and could be readily augmented by federal
programs in cooperation with expanded industry efforts, if necessary.
Zquipment needs are being net by industry through direct cooperation
in the establishment of local emergency response contingency plans
and mutual aid programs such as CMA's CHZMNZT.

CMA POSITION ON ISSUES
RELATIVE TO THE REAUTHORIZATION OF HMTA
There are generally twelve area* baing considered by tha National
Hazardous Matarials Transportation Advisory Council (an advisory
coasittat to DOT), tha Offica of Technology Assessment, and tha
Hazardous Materials Coalition for amending tha Hazardous Matarials
Transportation Act,
These twelve areas and tha recommended direction
CMA should take on them are as follows:
Hazardous Materials Regulations Must Be Uniform
CMA supports the recommendation that the regulations
governing the transportation of hazardous materials
should be nationally uniform.
Differing regulations
at tha federal, state and local levels for such
transportation are counterproductive to the safe
movement of hazardous materials.
While the existing language of the Hazardous Materials
Transportation Act clearly authorizes the Secretary of
Transportation to preempt inconsistent state and local
regulations, the process for obtaining such a ruling
has not worked to the satisfaction of government, in­
dustry or the public.
DOT 'inconsistency rulings”
should not be overturned by courts unless found to be
arbitrary and capricious.
DOT should consider both the
'inconsistency* criteria and the 'nonpreemption* criteria
in a single ruling.
These changes to the inconsistency
process will reduce the time and expense associated with
determining the lawfulness of state and local restrictions,
to the benefit of DOT, states, localities, industry and
ultimately to the benefit of safety.
CMA agrees with the recommendation that Congress should
clearly define the specific roles of federal, state and
local governments regarding the development of hazardous
materials transportation regulations.
In an effort to
achieve a nationally uniform regulatory scheme the federal
government, through DOT, should be solely responsible for
promulgating hazardous materials transportation regulations
after taking into consideration the input of affected
parties, including industry and other governmental agencies.
State and local regulations should only be promulgated in
areas DOT has not addressed and where states and localities
CMA 038670
have a unique and legitimate need to regulate.
CMA further
believes that state and local government should have the
primary responsibility for enforcing these national
hazardous materials transportation regulations.
(2) Data Base and Regional Flow patterns
CMA agrees with the recommendation that a data base sh uld
be established to determine the regional flow patterns for
hazardous materials.
He further agree that such information
should be limited to what is necessary for determining the
appropriate level and placement of emergency response train­
ing and equipment.
It is important that the information re­
quired for the development of this data base is limited to
those hazard classes and materials that have the greatest
potential for causing problems.
This will eliminate, the
likelihood that government will be saturated with super­
fluous information, and will focus the nation's emergency,
response capabilities to those areas where they are
needed most.
To the extent possible, the party most readily able to
supply the information (whether shipper, carrier, DOT or
state/local authorities) should be the party required to
supply it.
Also, existing sources of information and
sampling techniques (e.g., DOT incident reports, waybill
sample) should be considered before establishing new or
additional Information requirements*
Finally, commercially sensitive information should not
be required.
(3) National Emergency Response Awareness Program
Hhile CMA wholeheartedly agrees that the public must
be aware of their role when an accident occurs involving
hazardous materials, we further believe that there should
be a shared government/industry responsibility to let the
public know what safeguards and mechanisms currently exist
to minimise the potential for problems associated with the
transportation of hazardous materials*
The actual involve­
ment of industry in this area, which is extremely good,
should be conveyed as a part of this public awareness
campaign.
(4) Guidelines for Hazardous Materials Incident Planning,
Training and Equipment
CMA 038671
3
CMA it committed to the development of contingency plans
for responding to eaergencies involving hazardous aaterials.
These plans should eaanate at the local level by bringing
together the resources of eaergeney response officials,
federal, state and local governments, and industry.
CMA
and its aeabership have formally embarked on two major
programs that are designed to meet this objective.
These
programs are the Community Awareness snd Emergency Response
Program (CAER) and the National Chemical Response and
Information Center (NCRIC).
Prom an industry perspective, chemical manufacturers have
been very progressive in assisting emergency response
officials in the development of contingency plans and in
making detailed support information and equipment readily
available.
We intend to continue of efforts in this area,
and we encourage other industries associated with the
movement of hazardous materials to embark on similar safety
initiatives.
Registration program
CMA would not object if DOT, for good cause, decided to
exercise its current statutory authority to establish a
registration program for shippers and carriers of hazardous
materials, as well as manufacturers of containers for
hazardous aaterials.
In determining the need for a regis­
tration program, DOT should focus its emphasis on product
flow identification and enforcement.
As explained below,
a registration program should not be used for the collection
of funds for an Emergency Response Fund.
Establish A Fund
CMA cannot endorse the establishment of a federal emergency
response fund without a clearer understanding of the need
for a fund, the amounts involved, how the fund would be
administered, and how the effectiveness of the fund would
be measured.
CMA does not believe that the needs of state and local
emergency responders have been adequately assessed in terms
of training and equipment*
Dnder issue (2), Data Base and
Regional Flow patterns, DOT may develop Information per­
taining to the movement of hazardous materials.
This
information on where hazardous aaterials are moving should
then be compared to where public and private emergency
response capabilities exist.
Only then can an objective
assessment be made of the needs of the eaergeney response

Further, over 300 states and localities currently have
eaergency response capabilities for hazardous aaterials
spills.
Existing state and local eaergency response
prograas, coupled with voluntary industry assistance,
should be considered by DOT in assessing the overall needs
of the nation in teras of eaergency response assistance.
Pre-notification
CNA does not support the est«blishaent of shipaent-by■hipaent pre-notification requireaents for hazardous
aaterials at the state or local level.
State and local
shipaent-by-shipaent pre-notification requireaents are
counterproductive to the safe transportation of hazardous
aaterials.
They can cause unnecessary delays and aassive
paperwork subaissions that are of questionable value to
anyone.
CNA would not object to prior notification to a
central state authority of generic cheaical flow, although
we believe such notification should not be necessary sore
often than once every twelve aonths.
Further, auch of
this inforaation would have to be supplied by transporters
since they select the routes that are being used based on
their overall shipper/eonsignee geographic distribution.
(8) Local Perait,
Registration and Licensing Fee
As discussed in itea 6, CNA does not believe the need for
an Eaergency Response .fund has been deaonstrated•
As with
the federal eaergency response fund, CNA believes that local
perait, registration and licensing fees should not be peraitted unless unique local circuastances justify their need.
In the assessaent of the need for these local fees, industry
expertise and resources should be accounted for.
Money for enforeeaent of hazardous aaterials regulations
is currently available froa the federal governaent to those
states that have adopted the federal regulations.
CNA
supports this funding approach for enforeeaent.
{$) State and Local Sovernaents Adopt and Enforce Federal
Hazardous Materials Regulations
CMA 038673
5
CHA supports the adoption and anforeaaant of tha fadaral
hazardous materials regulations by stats and local govern­
ments.
We recognize that the federal government does not
have the necessary resources and personnel to adequately
police the hazardous materials shipping and transportation
communities.
Therefore, in order to enhance the safe
transportation of these products, cma believes it is
essential for state and local enforcement personnel to
ensure industry compliance with the national regulatory
scheme.
Good Samaritan Law
CMA supports the recommendation that all states should enact
Good Samaritan legislation to protect the liabilities of
those responding to emergencies involving hazardous
materials.
Enactment of such legislation is essential to
enhance industry response to emergencies involving
hazardous materials.
(11) Technical Assistance
In The Industry
The chemical industry is committed to providing technical
assistance to federal, state and local officials that are
responsible for protecting the welfare of the public.
Programs such as CMA's Community Awareness and Emergency
Response (CAER) and the Rational Chemical Response and
Information Center (NCRIC) are prime examples of this
commitment.
We believe these programs should limit the
need for establishing duplicative federal state and local
emergency response initiatives.
We welcome other sectors
of the hazardous materials transportation community to
contribute their ideas and efforts in building upon these
programs and communicating their availability.
Right To Know
CMA agrees that it is industry's responsibility to provide
product specific Information to emergency response personnel
so they can handle emergencies involving hazardous materials
in a timely and appropriate manner.
CMA currently provides
much of this information through its CHEMTREC system, and
subsequent contact with individual shippers. In addition,
the DOT Emergency Response Guidebook is a valuable source
for initial responders.
Regarding the distribution of general health and safety
Information about chemicals, it is CMA's policy that
member companies will furnish to a central state
CMA 038674
authority Macarial Safety Data Sheets for each product
manufactured in the state.
In addition, our members are
committed to furnishing copies of MSDSs to individuals,
such as transporters, upon request.
Further, CMA's new
Chemical Referral Center will enable callers to obtain
chronic health information from the manufacturer of the
product in question.
With respect to transportation, CNA believes that DOT
should mandate that Emergency Response Guidebooks be
kept at terminals to inform employees about the acute
health hazards associated with the chemicals they are
handling.
In the unlikely event that an employee is
exposed to a chemical that is being transported, contact
with the appropriate shipper or CMA Chemical Referral
Center will produce the necessary chronic health hazard
information.
CMA also would not object to the Guidebook
being carried in each truck cab and rail engine.
Exposure
to hazardous materials in-transit is rare, however, if a
leak should occur acute health hazard information is
essential.

Cobhunications Committee Report
to CMA Board
January 28, 1986
A year ago when John Huasey of Monsanto gave the coaalttee's
report, there wasn't a person in this rooa — or In this industry
— who wasn't shocked by the tragedy that occurred in India in
December of 1984.
To an Industry already under public scrutiny, this shock added
the eleaents of plant safety and operating coapetence to the
public's concerns about us.
To deteraine the extent of the
public's feelings about cheaicals, Caabridge Reports recently
conducted a national opinion survey.
The results of that survey were not encouraging.
Without going into all the details, the public's view of the
cheaical Industry was fairly straightforward:
We are perceived
as the nuaber one environaental risk to society and the nuaber

of Directors, January 28, 1986

two safety risk, with the nuclear power Industry ranked as number
one.
More than 70 percent of those questioned feel that a
Bhopal-type accident Is likely to happen In the U.S.
By
overwhelming majorities, the public supports legislation to
create rlght-to-know laws, mandatory emergency planning, and
buffer zones around chemical plants.
Perhaps one of the more disturbing findings was that 64 percent
of those polled aren't so sure that the benefits they get from
chemicals are worth the risk.
And about 60 percent of the public
wants more regulation of the chemical Industry even if such
regulation results in higher prices for consumer products.
Further, It will cone as no surprise to you that we rank last
among basic Industries in terms of public favorablllty — below
even the nuclear power and alcohol Industries.
However, not everything the Cambridge survey found out was
negative.
As an example, the public Is of mixed emotions as to the role
that perceived corporate greed plays In our environmental
performance.
About 51 percent felt that we're Just out to make a
buck regardless of the environmental consequences.
Yet 42
percent disagreed with that statement.
CMA 038679
3 The beet news is that three quarters of the public feels that the
chemical industry is making at least soae effort to ensure that a
Bhopal-type accident doesn't happen in the U.S.
While that's
hardly great news, it does show that the public is at least
somewhat aware of our excellent safety record and the things
we're doing to improve it even further.
We also learned that while the public is concerned about spills
and leaks and accidents, they feel that It is the long-term
health effects that are most important.
So as we take steps to
ensure against accidents and crises, we should not lose track of
the larger issue — namely, that the public is very concerned
about chronic health effects from exposure and use of chemicals.
In implementing a strategy to rebuild our reputation, we should
realize that there Is little opportunity to do something dramatic
to showcase our efforts.
As H. Clark said in Washington
recently, "We haven't been caught doing good.”
There Is little
we can do of a positive nature that will make page one or the
evening news.
And that's probably good.
With our luck, we'd
have Dan Rather signing off with "and this is the 10th straight
day without a major chemical mishap."
Instead, we must rebuild our reputation the slow way — with a
failsafe operating and safety performance, sincere attention to
the public's concerns, and a credible communications effort.

In responding to Bhopal, the industry wifely steered clear of
progress that would be seen aerely as public relations gestures.
By creating the CAER and MCRIC prograas, CMA has given the
Industry an activist response that involves an operating
coaaitaent by line aanageaent.
These prograas are comprehensive
and directed four-square at the public's aajor concerns about the
Industry.
Mot coincidentally, they also provide an excellent
communications opportunity at the local and state level that we
aust use to our advantage.
The current state of the industry's aedla relations and
cosaunications efforts is one of those good news/bad news
situations.
The good news is that the Intense aedia attention to

relationships with hundreds of media people.
to these people as never before.
We now have access
The bad news, of course, is
that It took some tragic events to bring this about.
When I say Intense media attention, I mean that literally.
The
number of media calls fielded by CMA in 1985 reached 10,000.
That's an 11 percent percent Jump from 1984.
At Amoco we
received 26 percent more media calls about our chemicals business
in 1984-85 than in 1982-83.
I'm sure that each of your companies
would report similar results.
Despite this media attention and despite the negative news items
of 1985, a professional view is that our treatment by the media
could have been a lot worse.
While each member of the
communications committee can recall a few horror stories from
1985, we agree that, on balance, the Industry received fair
treatment.
This occurred as a natural result of increased
personal contact between the media and the members of our
industry.
In many instances, our open and candid response during
these negative incidents helped establish credibility with the
media and showed our concern and our reasonableness.
As a result, we have created relationships with some media people
that will be a major communications asset for us In the future.
CMA 038682
Speaking of wita, our future communications activities will
benefit from the success of the CMA Superfund editorial contact
program.
This program, in which a number of you participated,
was a major communications achievement.
It succeeded because CMA
adopted a responsible and activist position on Superfund and took
that position on the road with great persistence and
thoroughness.
The results — In terms of editorials favorable to
CMA's position — were nothing short of incredible.
The
editorial contact program also proved once again that the
industry's greatest communications assets are the people in this
room and your peers in other CMA member companies.
To those in
the media, you ARE the chemical industry.
So, to answer the question "are things getting better with the
media?", I would have to answer a qualified yes.
established contacts and credibility.
tfe have
Opportunities exist for
substantially improved media coverage of our industry in the
future.
Looking to that future, the communications committee is convinced
that CMA's communications objectives will be best achieved by
concentrating on solving current problems with current resources.
While we are concerned about the industry's long-range goals, we
feel that we can accomplish many of those goals through properly
directed attention to today's problems.
CMA 038683
- 7 s a result, we will concentrate on the following areas In the
near future:
We will focus our support on the CAER/NCRIC programs, especially
now that many of the emergency plans have been prepared and are
ready to take to the public.
Our October open meeting was a CAER .
communications seminar that was very well attended.
We will
continue to recruit individual companies to actively support CAER
communications and we will work with CMA staff and the state
chemical councils in their CAER efforts.
We have set up a pilot program for communications committee
members to help Improve state chemical council communications
programs.
Three states are in our first batch that will begin
this year.
If successful, this approach could be expanded to
additional states in the future.
We will continue to support CMA and the CICs in their legislative
advocacy efforts.
As we've seen, a solid communications program
can help the industry reach its legislative goals.
We will encourage increased activity by chemical company senior
executives in communications activities.
You can expect us to
continue to come to you with media contact opportunities.
And we will promote a rational public dialogue on the subject of
risk perception.
Working with Bob Roland, we recently held a
CMA 038684
8
risk perception seminar for senior communications executives of a
dozen major chemical companies.
The result was an interesting
exchange of views that should encourage a more informed public
discussion of this important subject.
Before closing, I'd like to make two recommendations to you as
senior executives of your individual companies.
The first recommendation relates to the communications revolution
we're seeing in our Industry — the people doing much of the
communicating are not experienced, professional communicators.
The middle ranks in our companies are being subjected to media
attention as never before, particularly your plant managers.
As a result, we must Indemnify plant managers against the risk of
working with the media at the local plant level, especially as
the CAER program is implemented in each community.
Of all the
activities associated with the CAER program, the most difficult
for your plant managers is talking to the press.
Their fear, I
think, is that a slip of the tongue or a misquote will have
negative repercussions at the home office.
If we're serious
about CAER and local communications, we must create a climate
where plant managers can be confident of management support when
they speak out.
I realize that different companies have different policies in
this area.
And ther
are some risks involved:.
But we feel that
CMA 038685
- 9 the risks are greater if plant managers DO NOT work with their
local media, especially where the CASH program is Involved.
A corollary to this recommendation is that the industry's
conaunicatlons people have to ensure that our plant people have
the training and support to handle this eore active
communications role.
As an example, the comaunlcatlons portion
of the CAER handbook was a Joint effort of the conaunicatlons
conaittee and CMA staff.
Our second reconaendation is based on the fact that the public
and soae of the media nake little distinction between one
cheaical company and another.
To the public, we are all part of
the saae industry, for better or worse.
The entire industry
suffers when one of us Bakes page one with an eaergency of soae
sort.
With this in Bind, each cheaical company nust ensure that its
eaergency conaunicatlons procedures are as.up-to-date as its
eaergency operating procedures.
we should reneaber that there is no such thing as a national
cheaical eaergency, only a local incident that develops into a
national story.
If our local conaunicatlons are clear, concise,
and proper when an incident starts, there is a far better chance
that the resulting national news stories will reflect better on
the industry.
And, there's always a chance that if we do our
CMA 038686
10
communications Job right at the local level that the story will
not escalate to the state or national level.
In conclusion, It's clear that we have a lot of work to do and
that we're going to need all the patience we can ouster.
A lot
of positive activity is underway by CMA and the neaber companies
If we just give It time to succeed.
Given our continued coaaitaent to the operating and
coaaunications programs that the Industry is Involved with, the
communications committee is optimistic that over time we will
achieve our goal of regaining the public's confidence.
This Is a
goal worth the best efforts of every individual in our industry.
Thank you

EXHIBIT M
REMARKS TO CMA BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Thomas I. O'Brien
Chairman, Patent and Trademark Committee
January 28, 1986
Patents have long been recognized as an effective
stimulant to ingenuity and technology innovation In the
United States. After decades of benign neglect, patent and
other industrial property rights have again been recognized
as a key asset in maintaining the effectiveness of American
competition both at home and abroad. They have been
receiving increased attention in the government's dealing
with our economy and the competitiveness of U.S. industry
with foreign Industry. During the last ten years much
legislation and other actions, including the establishment
of a federal patent appeals court, have already been
implemented. These actions have strengthened the U.S.
patent system. But much remains to be done. Many of these
actions generally Impact on the chemical industry, and some
are specifically directed to it.
In reviewing 1985, I would initially like to mention
three significant developments in the patent field. The
first is the precedent set in the recent Kodak-Polarold
decision in which the courts refused to stay an injunction
in a patent case during the appeal period. Whether one
agrees with the decision in this particular case or not,
this decision is a major example of the continuing shift In
the judiciary to a pro-patent attitude. The Committee, I
might add, took no action in respect to this litigation, but
the decision Is notable in what it represents.
Secondly, the U.S. government instituted an
investigation under Section 301 of the 1984 Trade Act
against South Korea. The government is looking into the
adequacy of the laws of South Korea governing the protection
of industrial property rights and the effect of such laws on
U.S. trade in that country. Through this action, and
various other recent actions in the International trade
area, the government is demonstrating its concern with
unfair practices in the industrial property field by trading
partners.
The third is the effort initiated in various sectors
toward harmonization of international patent procurement law
CMA 038688
and practice. This represents a concerted effort by
governments and business to modernize, simplify and reduce
the costs of patent procurement throughout the world.
These three developments are ail seen as positive
actions in the general trend towards more effective patent
systems in today's world.
In the legislative area in 1985, there were no Important
If.S. laws enacted in the industrial property field, other
than on government budget matters.
1985 has been a year,
however, in which steady progress has been made in
legislative reform. There are presently pending 9 patent
bills, 4 trademark bills, and 5 other industrial
property-related bills. Efforts continue to change the law
to restore a full patent term for chemicals whose marketing
introduction has been delayed because of regulatory testing
and review by the government. Efforts continue to obtain
patent protection in the United States against Imported
products that have been made in a foreign country with
processes patented in this country. Changes in the law
governing patent licenses are being sought to give licensors
fairer treatment when licensees challenge the validity of
licensed patents. The Committee also developed CMA
positions on legislation on the utilization of federal
laboratory technology and on uniform patent procedures for
government inventions. CKA endorsed the latter legislation
but has concern on the high royalty sharing provision for
government employees In the technology utilization
legislation. Amendments to the Tariff Act have been
proposed to strengthen the rights of patent and trademark
owners in Section 337 actions for the exclusion of imported
products that infringe U.S. patents or otherwise compete
unfairly with domestic Industry.
Additional comments are warranted on some individual
1 terns.
As you may be aware from prior reports, the last
Congress enacted legislation extending the term of drug
patents whose effective term has been eroded by premarketing
regulatory testing and review. Agricultural and TOSCA
chemicals were deleted from that legislation. Bills have
b en Introduced Into the current Congress, and hearings have
been held, on similar patent term extensions for TOSCA and
agricultural chemicals. The CMA Committee had a principal
role in initially drafting this legislation when it was
introduced several years ago. The Committee continues to
yilov and supporc this legislation, albeit today In a
Acondary coordinating role to NACA because of the more
/^mediate concern of this bill to agricultural chemical
/manufacturers.
The Committee Is supporting the pending process patent
legislation. This is of particular significance to the
United States chemical industry. Although not limited to
che chemical industry, the chemical industry would be a
direct beneficiary.
It would give chemical producers
additional protection against foreign competitors who use a
process abroad that is patented in the U.S. and who then
import into the U.S. products made by that process. The
failure of current U.S. law to have such protection is
considered inequitable because most other developed
countries have such a provision and U.S. producers are thus
placed in an unfair competitive position in international
trade. Although some relief is now available against
importation of such products through the International Trade
Commission, that remedy has problems which this patent law
change would obviate.
Industrial property rights are fast becoming a key issue
in the international trade area. The government has
recognized that American companies have a vital interest in
protecting their proprietary positions abroad and that the
government should pay more attention to this element of the
American economy in foreign trade dealings. The government
is now examining the adequacy of intellectual property
protection in the context of the general review of the GSP
(G neral Systems of Preferences) program. The government is
also reviewing whether such inadequacies of a trading
.partner constitute trade barriers within the meaning of the
Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. The Committee has provided,
and will continue to provide, input for the chemical
industry to the U.S. Trade Representative's office on the
inadequacies of the industrial property laws of various
countries. As mentioned earlier, the U.S. Trade
Representative has instituted an investigation under Section
301 of the Trade Act against South Korea. It is understood
that current negotiations with the Korean government may
soon result in a settlement with significant improvements in
Korean patent, trademark and copyright laws.
Additionally in the international area, the Committee
continued to serve as chemical industry advisor to the
government on international conventions and treaties and on
cooperative governmental actions in this field. Efforts by
3
the developing countries to revise the Paris Convention to
permit a country to order forfeiture or compulsory licensing
of a patent if it is not worked within a short time after
grant have been successfully thwarted. The solid opposition
of Group B (developed countries), which has coalesced under
the leadership of the U.S., is the reason for this success.
Indeed, there are no further sessions of the Diplomatic
Conference planned at this time on that issue.
Harmonization of patent procurement law and procedures is
becoming an important and expanding international subject.
Adherence of the United States to Chapter II of the Patent
Cooperation Treaty was reviewed by the Committee, and
Committee members were urged to support passage in this
Congress of this non-controversial legislation. Under
Chapter II U.S. patent applicants will be able to request an
international preliminary examination and delay entering the
national phase on foreign filings for 30 months from the
date of the U.S. filing. The Committee has provided
comments supporting a proposal for an international grace
period for public disclosure of an invention before filing
without loss of rights to patents. Patent application
filing requirements, procedures and time deadlines are
harmonization issues that the Committee expects to review in
1986.
Conclusion
As I stated at the outset, the attitude of the courts is
becoming pro-patent and this has generally followed a
similar shift In attitude within the U.S. government,
especially in the Department of Justice and in the
International trade area. These changes, which are
strengthening industrial property protection, have not
occurred overnight. They represent the fruits of many years
of diligent effort on the part of many associated with
patents. Including the CMA Patent and Trademark Committee.
The time is ripe to finish the job.
In 1986 the CMA Patent
and Trademark Committee will continue to advocate CMA
positions in support of patent reform legislation, sensible
U.S. government patent policies, governmental actions to
improve industrial property protection for U.S. nationals in
international markets and harmonization of patent
procurement law and practice throughout the world.

EXHIBIT P
Superfund Status Report
Legislative Review
By Wells Denyes, Eastman Kodak Company
On December 10, 1983, the House passed its Superfund bill, on a
vote of 391 Co 33. this final action came after three days of floor
debate, including one session that ran past midnight. This followed
nearly a month of discussion and compromise between the principal
committees, who had jurisdiction for this legislation, on how to bring
the differing versions to Che floor for consideration.
On October 10 the House Public Works and Transportation Committee
reported their Superfund bill, but did not file their report until over
a month later. This created delay since it was necessary for the
principal committees, Energy and Commerce, and Public Works and Transportation,
along with Merchant Marine and Fisheries, and Judiciary, to reach agreement
on a compromise package which would be offered for floor debate. This
so-called "mini-conference" consumed most of November, and it was not until
December 4 chat agreement had been reached and all were able to meet with
the Rules Committee.
In October the House Ways and Means Committee agreed upon a funding
package that relied principally upon a Superfund Excise Tax similar
to the one adopted by the Senate. This funding provision became part
of the package adopted for House floor consideration.
During House floor debate, three controversial amendments became the central
focus of debate. The first, an amendment by Congressman Edgar (D-PA), which
'was adopted by a vote of 212 to 211, adds reporting of chronic hazards to
the community right-to-know section. This provision is similar to the
Senate section that was authored by Senator Lautenbcrg (D-NJ).
The second major floor issue was an amendment offered by Congressman
Frank (D-MA) to add a federal cause of action provision. This was defeated
162 to 261. This means that both the Senate and the House have now
rejected a victims compensation or federal cause of action provision co
Superfund.
The third controversial amendment was on funding.
By a vote of 220 to 206
che House adopted an amendment by Congressman Downey (D-NY) as a substitute
for che Ways and Means Committee proposal. Mr. Downey's amendment relies
almost entirely on che chemical and oil Industries for tax revenue to
fund a five year, S10 billion Superfund. The Downey proposal increases
chemical feedstock taxes by about 50%, with che bulk of this Increase being
a nearly tripled tax on inorganic substances. The tax on petroleum is
increased by over ten times, or if the funding for che new oil spill and
underground storage tank programs are Included, petroleum taxes
would increase by nearly twenty times. Also included is a wet waste
management tax which CMA has opposed. The D wney proposal does Include
substantial general revenues. Attached is a cable which summarizes the
revenue provisions in present law and of the Senate and House passed bills.
CMA 038696
The Senate and House have now both passed legislation extending Superfund
for five years. The two bills have significant differences. On the
programmatic side, the Senate bill can be likened to an outline describing
how the implementation of Superfund will be changed, but leaving the details
to the discretion of EPA, The House bill, although similar, fills in that
outline and leaves little discretion to EPA. These differences must be
resolved in conference. The differences in funding are far more substantial.
The Senate bill calls for $7.5 billion, most of which would come from a
broad based tax (SET). The House bill is larger and relies almost entirely
on the chemical and oil industries for its revenues.
During the final week before Congress adjourned on December 20, the
Superfund taxing proposals got caught up in the debate on the budget
reconciliation bill. Senator Packwood (R-OR), Chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, attached the Senate passed Superfund funding proposal
to this reconciliation bill. The House rejected this proposal and for
several days this bill moved back and forth between the Senate and the
House with each party rejecting the Superfund funding proposal of the ocher
on several recorded voces. The net result was chat the budget reconciliation
bill died with adjournment, primarily because of the differences over
Superfund.
When Congress returns on January 21, 1986, the differences in the
programmatic portion should not be difficult, although several are Important
and will require conpromlse. The differences in the funding arc far more
substantive and arc likely to require some significant changes in
position by the parties involved.
Until Congress returns and conferees are appointed. It remains too early
to develop a detailed strategy aimed at reaching an acceptable taxing
mechanism. CMA continues Co advocate (1) a freeze in the feedstock tax,
(2) opposition to the Haste End Tax Included in the House bill, and
(3) support of the need for and the equity of a large broad based
increment of funding.

AIR TOXICS CONTROL POLICY
Mr. Sorgentl and Mr. Berryman outlined the evolution of the proposed
program to address the air toxics issue. Mr. Sorgentl reported on the activities
of the ad hoc Executive Committee group comprised of himself, Messrs. Forney,
McKennon and Street, and representatives of the Environmental Management Committee
which had been appointed to resolve CMA's policy on this issue following the
October Board meeting. Mr. Berryman Introduced the other presenters and their
individual segments.
Mr. Holladay reported on the status of existing federal and state lav
regulating toxic air emissions. He also described various proposals pending or
expected to be introduced In the Congress and the states in 1986.
Mr. Symuleski presented the proposed policy and related Implementation
procedures on air toxics emissions and reviewed in detail what was Intended by
various elements of the proposal.
Mr. Kelley presented an overview of the package of legislative princi­
ples which had been developed to address 37 distinct legislative issues involved
in air toxics. Mr. Marchesanl described how the policy, options/procedures

presented of how the preferred, acceptable and worst case scenarios in the legis­
lative principles are based on the policy and the various implementation
procedures contemplated thereunder.
Mr. Roland presented an overview of the Association's tentative plans
for implementing the policy, including options for a public announcement In March
and concepts for enlisting, supporting and documenting member company participa­
tion. He indicated a work plan was under development and that an interdisci­
plinary team of committee members and staff would be charged with ongoing development and execution of that plan.

Considerable discussion followed concerning the language in the policy
and implementation procedures. Several amendments to the policy and
implementation procedures were made. The importance of being able to document
member companies' performance pursuant to the policy was stressed.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded, It was
VOTED: That the proposed policy on air
toxics control, as amended and set forth In
Exhibit N, be approved.
The Board agreed that it was inappropriate for it to formally vote on
the implementation procedures. However, it was also agreed that the procedures
were an Important document and that the suggestions made by the Board to amend
them should be incorporated and that the document should be subject to review and
updating by the EMC as the program evolved. The implementation procedures, as
amended by the Board, are set forth In Exhibit 0.
On behalf of the Board, Chairman Sella expressed appreciation for the
distinguished efforts of the ad hoc committee and the entire EMC.
SUPERFUND REAUTHORIZATION
Association Activities - Mr. Stover presented an overview of recent
developments and related Association activities and strategies. Mr. Stover
expressed his gratitude to the Dow Chemical Company for the outstanding contribu­
tion made by Mr. Lee Nute in serving as the Superfund project manager during the
past year.
Legislative Status - Mr, Denyes* report is attached as Exhibit P.
He highlighted the likely makeup of the House-Senate Conference Committee and the
^potential areas of conflict, and some possible scenarios for resolution. The
impact of Gramm/Rudman/Rollings and the tax reform debate were also discussed.
Mr. Denyes identified some ongoing areas of CMA activity, including the targeting
of conferees, as well as members of the Senate Finance Committee and the House
Ways and Means Committee. The various funding options being considered by the
Congress were discussed.
Chairman Sella reviewed the program Implemented last October and
November of senior executive visits with members of Congress. He requested chat
the Association's plan continue to Include utilization of Board members and other
senior executives in visits with the conferees and the Administration. Messrs.
Denyes and Stover Indicated that this was part of the work plan and would be
utilized as appropriate. Mr. Sella reiterated his belief that this was an
extremely Important activity which should be aggressively pursued.
Funding Policy - Chairman Sella reported on the Executive Commit­
tee's discussions regarding the Association's policy on Superfund funding. He
indicated, based largely on the input from the Government Relations Committee and
staff, that the Executive Committee agreed that no change in the Association's

Report of the Chemical industry Trade Advisor
to'the Board of Directors
of the
Chemical Manufacturers Association
January 27, 1986
My comments are directed to trade policy - - this morning - and what I believe to be our industry's concerns. Hopefully - - they
will dove-tail with A1 Spilner's CMA International Trade Committee
Report.
I wish my report this morning had better news.
- on trade matters - - we continue to lose ground.
Unfortunately -
our tctal industry sales - - to overseas markets - - and produce
another IS - 20% abroad. As an industry - - we are one of America's
major international traders. Only agriculture - - and electronic
manufacture- compare with our industry - - in international trade
accounts.
In Washington - - Both the executive and legislative branches of
government - - have become mere interested in trade during the past
year. But the resulting patchwork quilt of initiatives is confused - nd - - in some instances - - counterproductive (i.e. tax policy).
Seme bills - - to be sure - - are well-conceived. Others - unfortunately - - run the gamut from political posturing - - to
downright foolish gunslinging. We cannot assume that wisdom - - or
common sense - - will carry the day. Just look at the democratic tax
bill - - as the latest example - - of how badly our industry has been
treated.
Furthermore - - in the marketplace - - we're seeing the emergence
of powerful new competitors - - different competitors than we night
have envisioned only a few years ago.
The gulf states oil producers no longer hold world users on a
short leash. Today they have abundant cheap feedstocks - - new lowcoast production capacity - - and plenty of incentive - - to sell a
lot of value-added petrochemicals in our markets. That incentive
grows daily as the price of that oil barrel drops. We were all too
clearly reminded of this by Saudi planning Minister Hisham Nazir at
CMA's October conference.
If you follow trade statistics - - you know that the U.S. has
had an increasing merchandise trade deficit since 1980. In 1985 - and this is rough because all the numbers haven't been totted up - it looks as if tha trade deficit will be over $140-billion - - up at
CMA 038572
2
least 14% from 1984's deficit. As recently as 1980 - - we had a
manufacturing trade surplus of $5-billion.
Notwithstanding this national disaster - - our chemical industry
still achieved a statistical trade surplus - - estimated to be $7.6billion for 1985. Although we seem to be holding our own in chemical
exports - - an estimated $22.2-billion in 1985 - - chemical imports
have been increasing rapidly - - by about 11% per year since 1980.
They reached a record $14.6-billion last year - - and the USA’s share
of world trade - - declined for the 5th straight year.
In other words - - our industry trade surplus has dropped by
almost $12.2-billion.
Myron Foveaux recently gave his annual public trade
prognostication for 1986. Myron's numbers are based on the forecasts
- - that he obtains from about 45 of our chemical companies. He
forecasts our exports will be flat in 1986 - - despite the weakening
of the dollar - - and that imports will be up about 3.5 percent - to about $15.1 million. That will result in another 7 percent
decline in our trade surplus for the year - - to about $7 billion.
increasing share of our markets at home - - to foreign-based
producers.
Lest we draw consolation from the fact that we have any trade
surplus at all - - let's dissect its meaning. A trade surplus - means that the sales of our exports - - exceed the sales of imported
chemicals sold in the U.S. As you know - - sales alone doesn't mean
much if your pockets are empty at the end of the trading day.
I believe our trade picture - - is alot gloomier than our
projected $7.1 billion surplus suggests. If we had a way to
calculate a trade profitability balance - - the net effect of
chemical exports versus imports - - on our aggregate bottom line - would it still be a surplus? I doubt it.
Cn the export side of the ledger - - I suspect a lot of
companies are exporting near costs - - to preserve or build volume.
Consider the comment by IMC president George Kennedy - - In the New
York Times Last January - - "We've maintained - - or in some cases
of our profitability - - that's another story. We've had to cut them
- - in order to make up for the strong dollar."
Even if the U.S. can sustain a weaker dollar - - our exports
still face a myriad of problems - - High tariffs - - non-tariff
barriers - - subsidized nationalized competitors - - cheaper
feedstocks - - and our own unique brand of legislative impediments - including the burdensome e st of regulation.
CMA 038573
3
"exports." But trade means exports - - and imports. And that
increasing import figure - - should cause our industry to get cur
antenna up.
Are we simply being outgunned in our home markets by better
products and productivity abroad? or - - are we the victim of overt
and covert subsidies - - the largesse of our own GSP system - - our
open markets - - and the adverse effect of an overvalued dollar?
Trade should be a two-way street - - but in many initiatives - - both
traffic lanes seem to be coming our way.
Each of our companies are impacted by foreign competition
problems. Our exports have pretty much stagnated. Imports are
causing price - - and volume ripples - - in many of the domestic
markets. Our own government has negotiated away a piece of our
industry - - bromine products - t to Israel without as ouch as a byyour-leave. The prospect of further concessions - - Canada - Mexico - - and a new round of trade talks - - are not visible on our
horizon.
Some of our executives have stated - - that your companies
cannot tolerate further tariff concessions. Period!
1 believe there is a sense within the industry - - that past
multilateral trade agreements have not always been mutually equitable
- - that our chemical industry has given a lot - - without getting
very much in return. Regardless - - the administration is committed
to a further opening of the u.S. market - - through both the
bilateral and multilateral processes. It's pretty much of a "fait
•accomple" that several key events - - broad free trade negotiations
with Canada - - and a New GATT Round • - will begin within the next
13 months - • and Mexico's current problems can become our industry's
problem very shortly.
Concerning the future Multilateral Trade Negotiations - - I
believe that its not realistic that we oppose an MTN. It will
support the process.
We should be assigning our top international people to help
develop sound industry policy. We need cogent arguments. And we
need allies in other industries - - to ensure that our industry will
be fairly treated - - and not given up as a sacrificial lamb.
Beliave me - - this is a very important exercise - - As U.S. Bromine
producers learned - - During the U.S.-Israel frae trade process.
They were lucky - - to at least avoid a precipitous removal of
bromine tariffs ar.d - - instead - - are experiencing an extended
phase-down.
The CMA Board was presented with an international Trade
Comittee-recommended statement of principles concerning a New GATT
Round. Al Spilnar will discuss the ITC position in more detail.
CMA 038574
These principles art - - of course - ~ general - - but they contain
some important concepts:
- - The elimination of trade distorting practices - - subsidies
precedence over tariff reduction activities. An MTN should be
primarily a tariff-swapping meet.
- - Trade policy should not be subordinated to our foreign
producers are asked to pay the price - - for foreign policy gains.
- - The private sector should not be cut out of the negotiations.
- - The MTN process should not restrict - - the Administration's
bilateral treaty effort.
- - Development of a binding dispute settlement process - - must
be part of a new round. This is important. The GATT will continue
to be a weak sister - - unless it is given sene teeth.
- should be considered on the basis
of foreign requests - - and - - under no circumstances - - should
they volunteered across-the-board.
• - Chemical tariff concessions - - should not be made in
exchange for concessions given to another U.S. industry. He are not
in the business of dispensing charity.
- - We also need an investment agreement - - which will ensure
that we can situate production - - where raw materials availability
or markets dictate. We need to have equal access to local financing
of profits can be repatriated. Foreign National tax policy - - and
investment incentives - - should be granted on a national treatment
basis.
An Intellectual Property Policy - - must be part-and-parcel of
any new agreement. H £ 0 is the strength of our industry - - our
"hold card". If we let it be acquired - - without compensation - by foreign competitors - - we will be giving away a crucial part of
our future.
If you look at these statements in your briefing books - you'll see that each is an important concept - - not just a piece of
blue sky.
Trade legislation is the other key international area - - with
which we should be concerned. When I talk about trade legislation •
• I'm focusing on import-related initiatives - - changing the importremedy laws - - and considering the degree - - torvhich natural
resources subsidies should be countervailed.
CMA 038675
- 5 There are - - of course - - Many export-related areas of law - that affect our trade competitiveness. Seme such as foreign corrupt
practices and anti-boycott - - which were major causes a few years
bach - - are still unresolved.
Realistically - - If we get a single omnibus trade bill - - it
will be an achievement. Congress was in a dither in 1985 and no
clear trade legislation picture emerged. Because 1986 is an election
year - - We have a pretty small window - - perhaps until June for
something to happen.
What that bill would finally look like is anybody's guess. The
elements of such a bill - - will no doubt be drawn from several
proposals - - that were introduced last session and - - possibly - from the administration's own plan. So far - - the administration
has kept its own suggested wording under wraps.
However - - some key points to look for are:
- - General Trade competitiveness - - several proposals have
been made - - to establish a committee or council - - to evaluate the
effectiveness of cur trade laws ar.d agreements - - or to establish
what the general objective or our trade policy should be - - or some
combination of the above. The object would be to elevate trade's

mechanisms - - to prevent exchange rate fluctuations.

Various proposals - - would - - again - - shorten the processing time

specific 0.S. retaliation measures - - against unfair processes. As
with Section 201 - - Congress wants to tighten these remedies - -

making them more usable by business - - and more predictable in their
outcome.
- - intellectual property rights - - several proposals want to
tighten the prosecution of violators - - and ease the process of
uncovering such violations. This is particularly important to
pharmaceuticals - - and pesticide producers.
- * Export Finance - - House Democrats - - favor increased
future funding for direct lending. House Republicans - - on the
other hand - - want treasury and ex-im to have authority to match
mixed credits.
The other major import-re1ated issue - - and this one may end up
in the omnibus trade package - - is the question of whether upstream
subsidies - - should be countervailable. As first proposed by
Representative 5am Gibbons in 1984 - - U.S. Companies would be able
to get relief - - in the form for countervailing duties - - when
imports benefit substantially - - from the use of a natural resource
in the manufacturing country. Benefit would be assumed - - when the
natural resource is available to the foreign manufacturers - - at a
price "lower than the export price - - or fair market value - whichever is appropriate."
This upstream subsidies issue - - is a real corker for the
chemical industry - - We have companies who are strongly on opposite
sides of the issue.
At CMA we have a very active working group - - they met quite a
few times - - during a relatively short period in 1984. That group
was split right down the middle over this provision of the Gibbon's
bill.
At NAM - - the same thing happened - - right down the middle.
The international trade pendulum - - has swung totally in the
opposite direction since 1980. Our main concerns at the beginning of
the decade - - were export oriented - - offensive measures. Now the
issues are primarily import oriented - - defensive measures designed
to protect our domestic markets.
Like the patriots last night - - We have to get our offense
working.
Administration - - that all major legislation initiatives - - must be
considered in light of how they affect our trade competitiveness.
The tax initiative - • Superfund - - Export of Hazardous Substances
balanced against their trade effects - - which translate directly
into jobs.
As The Chemical Industry Trade Advisor - - My role is to be a
focal point - - for the 4 key chemical groups I mentioned earlier -
CMA 038677
t
- and to assure that - - as much as possible - - our industry speaks
as a single voice.
I am occasionally asked to deliver committee testimony - - in
support of a policy recommendation - - that has the blessing of those
groups.
I will also report to you periodically - - on developments about
which you should be aware - - or which require high level industry
action.
need your input - - and your support.
Last September - - CMA's ITC held a 2-day planning conference.
Committee members were asked to bring a copy - - of a public
statement about trade - - made by a senior executive of their
respective cempanies. The ITC
- - that about half the companies present - - had no senior
executive who had spoken out on trade - - no executive to champion
trade policy activities in the company.
A sound trade policy - - for out industry - - requires a long­
term commitment from all members of this Board. If our industry is
to remain internationally competitive - - we must all become involved
- - in convincing the administration - - that the future of
manufacturing - - in this country - - requires the development - - of
an aggressive trade policy initiative.
Each of you has a measure of clout
and key members of Congress. Let's put
'International Trade Committee's efforts
rules - - for our industry's industry's
with the Administration - some of it behind CMA’s
- - to reestablish the ground
international competitiveness.
Thank you.

Market access restrictions often take the form of high tariffs
used to protect relatively inefficient local producers.
Access
is also restricted by lau»s requiring owners of patents in certain
foreign countries to produce the product in that country or lose
exclusive rights to the patent.
In such cases* the patent owner is sometimes prohibited from
importing the patented product into that country when a local
producer decides to make it there* and is also prohibited from
collecting royalties from that producer.
Section 301 of U. S. trade law authorizes the President to
retaliate against the unfair practices of foreign governments or
instrumentalities which harm U. S. exports* but 301 only applies
to non-tar iff barriers which violate international trade
agreements.
At the present time* there are no effectively
enforceable international agreements on intellectual property
rights such as patents.
Nevertheless. CliA is already on record in strong support for the
establishment of such agreements and* where appropriate* has
included statements to that effect in testimony over the last f w
years.
The trend of rising imports might also be due* in part, to the
United States being overly generous in continuing to grant duty­
free entry under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to
imports of eligible products from developing countries whose
producers are now fully competitive with producers in the
industrialized countries.
CMA addressed the GSP issue when renewal legislation was
proposed.
The CMA position advocated stricter standards for
graduation of beneficiary countries from duty-free treatment of
imports under GSP* in cases where preferential access to the U.S.
market is no longer needed.
A two-tiered system of benefits was included in the renewal of
GSP in the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984.
Regulations
implementing the two-tier system will be issued later this year
on completion of the Administration's two-year study to determin
which countries should receive which level of benefits.
The
International Trade Committee will review the regulations to make
sure they are adequate.
In dealing with these and other issues affecting trade* the
Committee's primary concerns are that the U. S. ctremical industry
be treated fairly, and that any trade negotiations result in
increased export and investment opportunities.

for the procttt its If, CliA member companies, acting through
the Trade Committee and then the Board, must first reach

Then CMA must lobby the Congress, the

CMA lobbying will involve not only the International Trade
Committee and QCITA. but also the Government Relations

Depending on the issue, we may even ask that some of
you become involved in the lobbying effort.

Month put it, “CEO's Make the Best Lobbuists."

members were largely responsible for the insertion into the
renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences and into the
Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act ("CBI"> of provisions for
the protection of the intellectual property of U. S. companies in
countries covered by the legislation.
Timing is also important.
For maximum effectiveness, we may need
to prom te CMA positions to the Administration before the
Administration's position has been announced.
Afterwards is
often too late to get anything changed.
With that as background, I will review what the Trade Committee
accomplished in 1989 and what it plans for 1986.
Bilateral and multilateral trade initiatives were the most
important issues taken up by the International Trade Committee in
1989.
The Committee developed, and the Board approved, a CMA position
on bilateral free-trade negotiations between the United States
and Canada.
The CMA position supports the reciprocal elimination
of tariffs on chemicals and related products in U.S. /Canadian
trade, on the condition that the Canadian government eliminate
preferential Canadian chemical feedstock and energy policies and
restrictions on foreign investment in chemicals.
Incidentally, on Friday, I learned that the Board of Directors of
the Canadian Chemical Producer* Association (CCPA) approved a
position on U.S. /Canadian tariff negotiations that is similar to
CMA's position -- that tariffs on all chemicals should be on the
table for negotiation, not just certain chemical subsectors or
groups of products such as CCPA's original list of 26.
A copy of
CCPA's position is on its way to us.
In January, the Board approved a CMA position supporting
publication and implementation of the draft White House policy on
the export of hazardous substances.
CMA 038581
Th _ draft policy is based on tha principla of exchanging
information on regulatory activitias with othar countrias rath tr
than on diract controls such as licansing of exports or
prashipmant notification to tha fortign govarnmant on aach
transaction (movamant of product).
An ad hoc group consisting of CMA mambars and raprasantativas of
thar trada associations concarnad with U.S. policy on tha export
of hazardous substancas was sat up and bagan advocating adoption
of tha draft policy in maatings with tha Administration.
During tha 2nd quarter. tha Unitad Statas and Mexico signad a

Thara ara
just too many diffarancas batwaan tha two countrias for that to

Throughout tha year# tha Administration continuad to promota tha
idaa of a naw Round of Multilataral Trada Nagotiations undar tha

establishment of a coda on foreign investment# and improvement in

Approval

CMA 038582
1989 was also a year of much Congressiona1 debate on trada< but
no significant trade legislation was anactad.
Congressman
introduced a large number of trada bills in frustration over the
growing trada deficit and out of concern that the Administration
lacks a comprehensive policy to deal with trade problems.
However, the number and complexity of the trad* bills proposed,
the lack of strong central Congressional leadership on
international trade and the House Ways and Means Committee's
preoccupation with tax reform prevented passage of broad scope
trade legislation during the year.
Possibly in response to the Congressional activity on trade, in
September. President Reagan announced a new 20 point Trade Policy
Action Plan to pursue U.S. rights and interests in international
commerce.
Under the Action Plan, a Strike Force was established to initiate
or accelerate trade remedy proceedings against unfair trade
practices of other countries.
Several trade remedy proceedings
were initiated by the Administration by year end.
While 1989 was a year of Congressional debate on trade and
Administration preparation for negotiations.
1986 will see more
action.
Congress has stated that international trade will be the next
major issue it will address, once work on tax policy is out of
the way.
The House Ways and Means Committee is planning a
weekend retreat early in the session to initiate its work on
trade problems.
What the result will be is uncertain.
As Dexter mentioned,
getting a single omnibus trade bill out of the many which have
been introduced will be an achievement.
However. Congress, wi11 not pass sector-specific legislation
restricting imports unless the trade deficit continues to grow
unabated and the Strike Force and other elements of the
President's Trade Action Plan are considered ineffective.
Rather, any new trade legislation will focus on strengthening the
President's authority to initiate action against unfair trade
practices of foreign countries, and will encourage the President
to take such action.
New trade legislation may also include limitations on the
President's discretion in granting import relief in "escape
clause" cases once an injury finding has been made.
In addition,
it may include expanded trade adjustment assistance for workers
and assistance for communities whose industries have been hit by
international competition.
Tha Committ a is studying individual provisions of bills that
might hava an impact on tha chamical industry and will davalop
and racommand CMA positions* as naadadi for Board approval.
Tha Unitad Statas and othar GATT signatory countrias will
probably bagin a naw Round of Multilataral Trada Nagotiations
undar GATT.
Onca tha Board approvas a CMA position on tha naw
Round* tha Trada Committaa and tha Govarnmant Ralations Committaa
will plan a combinad affort to promota tha CMA position to both
tha Administration and tha Congrass.
Th
Unitad Statas and Canada will bagin formal nagotiations
toward a fraa-trada araa agraamant batwaan tha two countrias.
Tha Intarnational Trada Committaa has bagun and will continua to

Tha Committaa will complata its work on principlas for bilataral
trada nagotiations batwaan tha Unitad Statas and Maxlco* and will

from tha Association of Southaast Asian Nations* tha Gulf

EXHIBIT C
Remarks to CMA's Board of Directors
Chairman, Health and Safety Committee
January 27, 1986
I am pleased to present to you today tha first annual report of the
Health and Safety Committee.
This Committee was formed by Board action In January 1985 to
provide the Association a central focus for oversight and coordination
of health and safety policy and programs. With public health and safety
concerns being the central driving force behind most recent environ­
mental and chemical control laws and regulations, the Health and Safety
Committee gives CMA the ability to orchestrate a consistently coordinat­
ed advocacy program for public health and safety policy. The Commit­
tee's oversight of health and safety policy facilitates the Integration
of these Issues Into programs and policy developments of the other
committees, resulting in a closer working relationship with the Environ­
mental Management, CommunlcatIons, Engineering Advisory, Distribution,
and State Affairs Committees and the Biomedical and Environmental
Special Programs.
The Committee replaced two standing Committees - the Chemical
Regulations Advisory Committee (CRAC) and the Occupational Safety and
Health Committee (OSH); two Executive Committee Task Groups - the Public
Compensation Task Group and the UAREP Work Group; and reduced the number
of task groups from 36 to 16. This consolidation was accomplished
without disruption of any ongoing activities or significant loss of
relationships with outside groups. This has allowed us to address the
pressing Issues with fever task groups and fever people, reducing the
number of member company representatives Involved, requiring less travel
and fewer meetings.
The restructuring of the Industry and of many CMA member companies
has presented unique challenges In that several of the key Task Group
members, and some of the Committee members have had significant job
changes, resulting in some people turnover and changes in leadership.
Unlike the predecessor committees or task groups, the current Task
Groups no longer have agency-specific responsibility but have functional
responsibility based upon the expertise needed by the group to carry out
its mission. The functional units are risk analysis, risk management,
risk communications, compensation, and external affairs and are shown
schematically on page 31 of the report.
The Committee has 6 major goals that were developed at a planning
meeting shortly after the Committee was formed. We can pick and choose
CMA 038686
2
and appropriate Task Force expertise and resources needed to achieve
successful completion of each goal.
This creates a true matrix organization and allows us to focus
resources on an Issue without redundancy and needless waste of time for
company or staff personnel.
The Committee and most of Its Task Groups have kept busy all of
1985 because of the diversity and complexity of the Issues for which the
Committee Is responsible, the reorganization necessary to consolidate
the ongoing activities without loss of momentum, and the constant demand
for action and reaction as a result of the several chemical releases
which have occurred at Bhopal, Institute, and elsewhere. We Initiated
new programs to improve the public's perception of the chemical Industry
as being responsible. We also have had some less visible but equally
necessary programs which are more basic and behind the scenes. These
activities usually Involve generally working with legislative or regu­
latory contacts on issues vital to the industry.
The remaining time that I have today will be spent discussing some
examples of programs, followed by a brief review of areas which the
Committee anticipates will require priority attention in the future.
Following the Bhopal catastrophe, a special task group, chaired by
Hamilton Hurst and reporting to the Executive Committee, developed the
two new chemical Industry programs - Program and the National Chemical
Response and Information Center (or NCRIC).
The CAER Program was assigned to the Health and Safety Committee
for Implementation and follow-up. It has been well received and contin­
ues to generate favorable reaction from the media and regulators.
Industry reception has also been good. OVer 170 companies have signed
up to participate In the CAER Program and have named an executive as the
company's CAER coordinator. The CAER coordinator Is a critical link
between the company's facilities managers and the Program.
The CAER Task Group has held a series of regional workshops at
which the Program has been described to more than 1,700 chemical Indus­
try managers, and over 1,100 sites have been selected to begin the
process for Implementing CAER. In addition, community coordinating
groups, which usually Include emergency response officials, elected
officials, and representatives of Industry and the public, have been
Initiated, CAER handbooks have been distributed in the U.S., and other
communications materials, Including slide/tape shows, videotapes, and
brochures, have received wide distribution to facilities managers,
emergency response groups, and police and fire fighters. A monthly CAER
newsletter Is prepared and distributed by the Task Group.
CAER has created a consnunlcatlons network for CMA and member
companies to local emergency response groups and to the EPA, Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), other federal agencies, and with
other trade associations.
CMA 038587
3
CAER has helped to prominently portray the industry as being
concerned with public health and safety and has given us the unique
opportunity to build public credibility. We are continuing our efforts
to capitalize upon this initiative. Although CAER has been highly
successful in showing positive actions that industry is taking, we have
some concerns of which you should be aware and that do require atten­
tion. Of the 172 companies that have signed up for the CAER Program, 60
have not submitted either of the 2 milestone reports which are now past
due. This creates concern that ve may not be able to maintain the
credibility of the Program. We need your help, through contacts you may
have in other companies, to continue to emphasize the importance of the
CAER initiative to the current and future credibility of the industry.
Turning now to the less visible programs the Committee and its Task
Groups have conducted. These activities are more numerous than the
up-front, active, visible programs, such as CAER, and have been equally
as effective in supporting CMA's advocacy positions.
In response to public legislative demands following Bhopal, the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) developed their
Special Emphasis Program, designed to target chemical plants for addi­
tional safety and health inspections, irrespective of plant safety
performance. These inspections, were initially designed by OSHA to be
highly technical, in-depth process hazards reviews, rather than routine
OSHA inspections. By working with the Agency, representatives of the
Committee were able to help OSHA recognize its lack of expertise to
carry out such a program and then assisted in redrafting the program to
be one that only serves OSHA's purposes but is consistent with our
companies' process safety management reviews.
Also in the occupational safety and health arena, our Committee
became aware that a representative of the International Textile Workers
Union had chaired a committee which had completely rewritten the Bureau
of Labor Statistics Reporting Guidelines for Occupational Illness and
Injury (BLS 412). This document, which contained very onerous pro­
visions for all of industry, some of which are detailed at the top of
page 18 in your book, had already been approved by the Department of
Labor and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (0MB) for
approval to Implement. By contacting 0MB, we were able to get the
document recalled by the Department of Labor and then rewritten to
present more balanced guidance on reporting occupational illness and
injuries. This has been followed with extensive contacts with BLS,
Including taking the Commissioner and member of her staff to tour plants
in our industry.
Representatives of the Committee have also been very active with
ERA in the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) area and have addressed
many of the concerns that surfaced during congressional hearings regard­
ing assessment and management of chemicals.
A dialogue group, under the umbrella of the Conservation Founda­
tion,- came to agreement on mechanisms for EPA management of new chemi­
cals after Premanufacturing Notification (PMN). This issue is a TSCA
deficiency that was highlighted during congressional testimony.
CMA 038688
4
Representatives of the TSCA Reauthorization Task Group provided the
leadership to bring the industry, public Interest representatives, and
state members of the dialogue group to closure on the Program. The
Program, now called "New Chemical Follow-Up," has been recommended to
EPA for action. The Agency has indicated a willingness to initiate
rulemaking to codify the Program, thus defusing this concern in future
congressional activities.
Another concern during congressional discussions of TSCA was
negotiated testing. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), CMA,
and EPA worked collectively to develop a procedure for negotiating test
agreements and developing test rules under Section 4. The new procedure
was developed under the principle that test rules and negotiated testing
agreements should be equivalent and consent Orders under TSCA Section 4
would be the primary mechanism to satisfy that principle. The Consent
Orders, as the test rules, would Include requirements to ensure adequate
and reliable data, would be enforceable, and would conform to other TSCA
regulatory requirements. In addition, the new procedures would Include
an opportunity for public participating and an expedited schedule for
negotiating and rulemaking. After final agreement by the 2 Involved
parties, EPA will issue the procedures as an interim final rule in
February or March 1986. The result of this successful effort has been
to lower public pressure to amend TSCA, precluding what could be more
onerous testing procedures and timetables. It has also improved working
relationships among the 3 parties involved In the negotiations.
The Committee has also, through the Public Compensation Task Group,
assisted Government Relations In recommending and supporting various
Initiatives in the Superfund reauthorization process. These have
Included recommending public health surveillance as an Integral compo­
nent of Superfund, assisting in preparing lobbying packages opposing
Victimsf Compensation proposals as these were Introduced or discussed,
and communicating the results of the UAREP study of possible health
effects from hazardous waste sites. The Superfund bills before Congress
have no victims' demonstration programs, no federal cause of action, and
much better health studies provisions as a result.
Priority Issues which are anticipated to require significant
attention in the future are the following:
o
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has been
relatively inactive in standards development for the last 4 years.
Few standards have been developed and those that have been devel­
oped have responded to court mandates or intense legislative
pressure. Industry has not had to comply with the new regulations,
but we have missed opportunities to assist in the development of
standards which address workplace needs in a cost-effective way.
OSHA will not be able to continue being unresponsive to its legis­
lative mandate, nor Is it in Industry's best Interest to continue
to miss significant opportunities to assure cost-effective, practi­
cal workplace standards.
Through its National Emphasis Program, OSHA has served notice
that our industry, irrespective of our excellent safety record,
CMA 038589
5
will be more carefully scrutinized for workplace safety and health.
We can anticipate that, in addition t increased standards-setting,
chemical plants will be inspected more frequently by OSHA. The
Health and Safety Committee is prepared to assist OSHA where it is
needed and appropriate, including considering the development of
some forward-looking programs to continue to improve the industry's
image.
o
In the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) area, biotechnology
regulation is relatively quiet now but will likely become more
active in the future. Although it may become a high visibility
issue, we want to keep it separate from other TSCA Issues. We will
continue to monitor work closely with other trade associations and
develop positions as appropriate.
Reauthorization of TSCA has been given a lower priority by
Congress for the last year, largely because their calendar was so
full of other health-related activities. This will not last,
however. We will continue to address the identified concerns and
stand ready to become a player in the debate as soon as it is
rejoined.
A National Research Council (NRC) report stated that the
toxicity data that are available on chemicals in commerce are both
very limited and Inadequate. Many people are now using this report
to show a supposed need for mandatory testing and a minimal test
set. Unfortunately, no readily available body of data exists to
give a better understanding than is given by the NRC report. The
Committee will be evaluating the accuracy of the report and what
can be done to Improve the data base and refute the report. This
is probably a longer term project, however, and not one that lends
itself to relatively early resolution.
o
Legislative activities will continue, especially In the area of the
chemical Industry's effect on the health of the public and our work
force. Occupational illness had drawn several congressional bills
recently and the proponents of such measures have not been success­
ful yet. The Committee Is already actively participating in this
debate and will continue in order to prevent our Industry's opera­
tions and products from being unfairly singled out for legislative
treatment.
Public compensation activities will continue, especially in
the area of product liability, where we are working with the CMA
General Counsel's office, and the Government Relations staff to
address Senator Danforth's bill. The Superfund reauthorization
battle will be rejoined soon and health effects from hazardous
waste sites will continue to be one of the emotional leaders in
this struggle. The Public Compensation Task Group will continue to
play an important role In this area.
The issue of health effects from emissions from operating
facilities will come more to the fore. The Environmental Manage­
ment Committee, assisted by the Health and Safety Committee, has
CMA 038590
6
been developing a position on this. Congress and the regulatory
agencies vlll continue* however* to use public health as the
driving force for more legislation and regulation addressed at the
chemical Industry. The Health and Safety Committee will continue
to develop health policy for the Association and to assist other
committees and departments to respond to Issues in the public
health arena.
The Health and Safety Committee has been conceived, bom, and
nurtured during a very trying time for the chemical Industry. We
believe we he successfully negotiated this traumatic birthing without
losing any momentum, with our goals constantly In front of us and our
eyes on them.
f
One of the hallmarks of the Committee's activities has been to try
to address Issue In there entirety by going to the heart of the problem
and looking at how legislators and regulators decide to take action.
Using this assessment, we have addressed the Issues in depth and pro­
posed long-term fixes, not just treated the obvious symptoms and provid­
ed a cosmetic cure and left the roots of the issue unattended. The
Committee Intends to continue this approach to the health and safety
issues which will be affecting the chemical Industry In the near and
distant future.

I will be glad to answer any questions you may have.

REPORT OF THE
CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF NEW JERSEY
Request for Individual Company Support and Action
Objective
To increase the effectiveness of the Chemical Industry Council of
New Jersey in representing the chemical industry in New Jersey.
Background
Chemical industry Presence in New Jersey
o
Approximately 95,000 workers are employed by New Jersey's
chemical industry (largest chemical workforce in nation)
o
New Jersey's chemical industry is the largest manufacturing
industry in the state
o
New Jersey companies manufacture chemical products valued
at S14.2 billion per year (second in nation)
o
New Jersey's industry produces about 12.50% of the nation's
chemical output
I
CIC Organisation and Programs
CIC/NJ is comprised of 87 member companies (See Attachment 1) from
the chemical, pharmaceutical and allied products industries. The
Council employs two professional and two support staff and has a
budget of approximately $250,000.
Political Climate
The New Jersey legislature is recognized as one of the most active
in the country and is considered anti-industry in the environmental
and health and safety areas. The state has been a "leader" on such
legislative issues ast State Superfund (including funding and
liability standards), worker and community right to know, the Toxic
Catastrophe Prevention Act, and Environmental Cleanup
Responsibility Act (ECRA).
Follow-Up To September State Chemical Organizations Report
At the September CMA Board of Directors meeting, a special report
on the status and programs of the various state chemical
organizations was presented by Mr. Bill Wood of Dupont, who
chaired a special ad hoc work group established to conduct this
CMA 038592
report. The report gave an overview of the status and programs of
the 13 CIC's and made some generic recommendations for CMA and
member company actions to improve the effectiveness of all C1C
programs generally. Although reaction to the report was favorable,
several of the Association's Officers and Directors requested that
more specific requests for action be made to the Board with respect
to individual CIC programs where there are particular problems
and/or needs. At the October Annual Meeting all of the state
chemical organizations, their leaders were asked to identify those
areas where they believed CMA's Directors could uniquely assist
their program. The CIC/NJ is the first to respond.
Recommendations
The leadership of the CIC/NJ, acting pursuant to the opportunity made
available as a result of the September CMA Board meeting, suggests that
the following actions be taken by individual companies at the direction
of members of the CMA Board.
It is the belief of the CIC/NJ leadership
that positive action on these recommendations will result in
significantly increased effectiveness on the part of the CIC/NJ. It is
also their belief that direct action by members of CMA's Board and
other CMA Executive Contacts are essential to accomplish these actions.
Company Participation
I
1. That nominees from CMA member companies to the CIC/NJ's
Board and Executive Advisory Committee represent the most
senior individuals possible from New Jersey operations.
i
2. That CMA member companies support, through organizational
membership and active committee participation, the CIC/NJ's
programs.
Increased Public Relations/Communications Assistance
ft
In order to implement the communications program recently
developed by the CIC/NJ Public Relations Committee, that the
CMA Directors with New Jersey operations provide company
public relations professionals to concentrate on
communications support for such legislative issues as air
toxics and waste site cleanup.
Availability of Company Technical Experts
That the Board of Directors be willing to make available, on
an as-needed basis, nationally recognized company technical
experts in the following areas to assist in legislative and
i
CMA 038593
regulatory advocacy. This would augment the excellent work
being done by many facility based technical personnel.
risk assessment and management
process safety
air toxics
groundwater
cleanup standards
pesticides regulations
Surplus Office Equipment
That companies donate the following surplus (or new) office
equipment:
i
postage machine and mailers
addressograph
letter-quality printer compatible with Digital computers
fils cabinets/bookcases
video recording and camera equipment
surplus desk and conference chairs
Personal CEO/Senior Executive Commitment
That members of the Board of Directors' with facilities or
corporate headquarters in New Jersey commit to appear at
CIC/NJ press conferences, deliver speeches, participate in
media tours, or attend editorial board visits with major
newspapers on the following chemical industry issues in
support of the CIC advocacy program:
abandoned waste site cleanup funding
air toxics
groundwater
CAER program /HMACs
To further chemical industry success on key issues, it is also
requested that CEOs/Senior Executives in New Jersey host
private meetings at company facilities with various state
legislators.
Action Required
Board endorsement of the thrust of the recommendations and subsequent
indications of individual company actions to achieve them.

Remarks to CMA's Board of Directors
By William M. Bellamy, Jr.
Chairman, Tax Policy committee
January 27, 1986
In 1985, Che Tax Policy Committee was very deeply involved in
key legislative issues affecting the chemical industry.
Responding
co the numerous problems raised in both tax reform and Superfund
reauthorization legislation, the Committee effectively handled a wide
range of tax issues that could Increase industry tax costs by more
chan $6 billion annually.
Since November, 1984, the Tax Policy Committee has focused on
che major tax revision issues that are of continuing concern to the
chemical Industry.
These Issues were first raised in the context of
che Treasury Department's 1984 Tax Reform Proposals and later In the
preparation of CMA's testimony on President Reagan's May 28 tax
reform program before the House Committee on Ways and Means.
In general, President Reagan's 1985 tax reform program would
shift almost 8140 billion of the Federal Income tax burdens now borne
by individuals to the business sector.
The President's program would
substantially increase the tax burdens of businesses chat are capital
intensive and that engage in significant international trade.
The specific Issues raised in the President's program are set
out in detail at Tab 6 of our committee report.
For this reason I
will not repeat that discussion except to reiterate why federal tax
issues are so vitally important to the chemical Industry.
First, let me emphasize that for many years the chemical
industry has enjoyed one of the most favorable tax positions among
U.S. industrial sectors.
Both reasonable capital cost recovery
periods and the Investment tax credit have been available for
chemical manufacturing Investments for a number of years.
To some
extent, the principal achievement of the Accelerated Cost Recovery
System (ACRS), adopted as part of President Reagan's 1981 tax
program, was to provide other industries with tax depreciation
comparable to chat which the chemical industry enjoyed.
Beyond its favorable depreciation position, the chemical
industry is unique among capital intensive industries in che extent
to which it can utilize the investment tax credits generated.
In
1985, the chemical industry invested more chan 314 billion In new
plant and equipment, almost 90 percent of chose expenditures
qualified for che Investment tax credit.
In current dollars, the
investment tax credit reduces the annual tax bill of the U.S.
chemical industry by over $1 billion.
Moreover, the chemical industry is far more dependent on
international trade than many other capital intensive industries.
For example, in 1985 che United States exported chemicals and allied
products with a value of $22.2 billion and in chat year imported
$14,6 billion.
With a combined total of approximately $37 billion in
CMA 038695
Ic is clear that CMA has a strong, vital interest in tax reform
legislation that reflects a uniquely chemical industry concern.
We
are organized under a comprehensive work, plan to defend the
industry's interests in taxation.
We are working cooperatively to
implement that plan on Capitol Hill.
We look forward to positive
achievements in the Senate and in any tax legislation that may be
enacted this year.
In closing, let me reiterate what I told you at this time last
year.
The Tax Policy Committee and its members have worked hard this
year; the members of the Committee are true tax professionals who
have devoted a substantial amount of time and effort to achieving the
objectives of the Committee.
Again, I am proud to have served as
Chairman.
While relatively unheralded, CMA's achievements in
taxation, both legislative and regulatory, are unsurpassed in their
contribution to the well-being of our Industry.
We expect
to continue this
record of positive achievement

TAX REFORM ADVOCACY
Background:
The House of Representatives narrowly passed H.R. 3838, the Ways and
Means Committee tax revision legislation, after President Reagan
personally intervened in the Congressional debate. Like President
Reagan's May 28 tax program, H.R. 3838 would provide a massive shift
of Federal income tax burdens now borne by individuals to business
taxpayers, within the business sector, H.R. 3838 would substantially
increase the tax burden of businesses that are capital intensive and
that engage in significant international trade. It is conservatively
estimated that the overall impact of H.R. 3838 as passed by the House
would cost the chemical industry more than $3 billion annually.
CMA Program Development and .Response:
Since November, 1984, the Tax Policy Committee has focused on the
ma}or tax revision issues that are of continuing concern to the
chemical industry. These issues were first raised in the context of
th Treasury Department's 1984 Tax Reform Proposals and later in
preparation of CMA’s testimony before the House Committee on Ways and
Means. In addition, the Committee prepared several one-page specific
legislative issue analyses which the Taxation Task Group of the
Government Relations Comittee has used extensively in our meetings
with Congressional members and staff.
CMA commissioned Price Waterhouse to conduct a study of effective tax
> rates in the chemical industry. The Price Waterhouse study of IS
companies who are primarily engaged in chemical manufacturing shows
that these companies paid an effective tax rate of over 23 percent in
1983, one of the highest effective tax rates paid by any industry
group in that year. The Price Waterhouse study has been distributed
widely and is being used by CMA in its lobbying efforts on both tax
reform and Superfund. The response to the Price Waterhouse study has
been very favorable.
In addition, CMA provided a grant to the Institute for Research in the
Economics of Taxation (IRET) for a study on the impact of selected tax
reform proposals on capital formation in the chemical industry. These
provisions include the repeal of the investment tax credit, reduction
of depreciation benefits, recapture of accelerated depreciation, and
increased alternative minimum tax. In its brief summary, the IRET
study concludes that;
"Major provisions in the President's tax reform proposals
and in the tax reform options under consideration by the
CMA 038598
Committee on Hays and Means would have devastating effects
on the U.S. chemical manufacturing industry. Particularly
damaging would be the proposed changes in depreciation rules
along with the proposed "excess depreciation recapture" and
the alternative minimum taxes. Despite the proposed
reductions in statutory tax rates, these changes would raise
the effective tax rates to which chemical manufacturing
companies are exposed and would, as a result, materially
slow the growth in the industry's production facilities and
employment, cost the industry's employees billions of
dollars in lost real wages, and reduce the industry’s output
substantially below levels that would otherwise prevail.
The competitive position of U.S. chemical manufacturers in
both domestic and foreign markets would be significantly
eroded."
On January 6, the Senate Finance Committee announced that it will hold
hearings on tax reform beginning January 29 emphasizing the
consequences of H.R. 3838 for international trade of U.S.
manufacturers.
In these hearings, CMA is requesting the opportunity
to testify.
The Tax Policy Committee and the Government Relations Committee's
Taxation Task Group have developed a comprehensive legislative
strategy and work plan on tax reform legislation. The Taxation Task
Group has held regular meetings to implement this work plan, to share
intelligence on tax legislation, and to coordinate CMA activities with
allied trade associations. CMA has now been joined by other major
trade associations in the opposition to key tax revision proposals in
H.R. 3838 affecting capital formation and international activities.
He anticipate that there will be much greater concern in the Senate
over the tax impact on those policies than was shown in the House.

REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT
ASSOCIATION PROGRAM AND ISSUE REPORT
ADVOCACY OVERVIEW
Congress
The first session of the 99th Congress was an active one for both
the House and Senate on economic issues, but they did not reauthorize any
of the pending environmental laws.
Congress adopted the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, a law which
requires a balanced budget by fiscal 1991 and requires Presidential
sequestration orders across the board on outlays and budget authority in
order to achieve intermediate deficit targets each year, if Congress and
the President do not meet deficit targets through legislative action each
year.
The House passed a comprehensive tax reform bill. The bill reduces
tax rates for individuals; increases the personal exemption and the
standard deduction for individuals; reduces real estate tax shelters;
repeals the investment tax credit; reduces five corporate brackets to
three and reduces the top corporate rate from 46 to 36 percent; reduces
the deductibility of business entertainment expenses to 80 percent of the
current level; establishes a broad-based 25 percent minimum tax for both
corporations and individuals and establishes less favorable depreciation
schedules.
Two bills in conference would reauthorize the Safe Drinking Water Act
through 1989; and authorize a total of $12 billion for sewage construction
grants and $9 billion for water pollution control through FY 1990.
Bills passed in differing forms by both the House and Senate and now
awaiting conference would reauthorize the Superfund Act. Many
controversial issues remain to be resolved including the funding level,
funding mechanism and program issues.
Congress passed the Textile and Apparel Trade Enforcement Act and
sent it to the President. It was vetoed on December 17, hours before it
would have become law without his signature. The bill was designed to
restrict and regulate textile imports, yet maintain a level of foreign
imports high enough to allow consumer choice.
Page
I
CMA 038606
The 1986 Congressional session is very unpredicatable at this time
because the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law presents Congress
with many new challenges. Add to this the usual uncertainties of an
election year and 1986 will add up to another difficult year for the
Congress.
Federal Regulatory Agencies
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The agency is moving rapidly
to implement legislation under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and the
Research Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
Regulatory activities
under the SDWA are especially vigorous, and RCRA implementation during the
next quarter will be dynamic.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The recent decision by FDA to
classify the risk of cancer from methylene chloride exposure as de minimis
at a risk of one in a million is a major step away from the 2ero risk
concept. The decision is sure to be challenged, but it dramatizes a
growing awareness among federal agency administrators that adhering to
zero risk, even for carcinogens in food, is an unacceptable public policy.
It also adds another case to a growing set that endorses a lifetime risk
of one in a million as a future standard.
OSHA Special Chemical industry Program, on November 4, 1985, OSHA
established a pilot National Emphasis Program for programmed inspections
of chemical industry establishments. The program, which reflects
virtually all of CMA's comments of August 29, appears to represent a sound
approach. During the first year of the pilot program, eighty plant
programs will be inspected by qualified compliance officers who will
examine process safety and emergency response procedures.
Occupational Safety s Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA is also
completing its inspection check sheet for evaluating industry's worker
education and training programs. This program will become effective in
May 1986.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The Commission has
proposed a natural gaa block billing rule that could cost the chemical
industry $600 million a year if not modified.
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The Secretary of Energy, John
Herrington, announced that DOE is developing options for natural gas
legislation that will serve as the basis for a new Administration bill for
deregulation. He indicated that an Administration bill is preferable to
endorsing any of the several gas bills pending, and their bill should be
ready for Congress in January 1986.
Page
2
CMA 038606
The DOE also plana to send National Energy Policy Plan V to Congress
m January. The plans are required every two years as updates of federal
energy policies.
States
Advocacy at any level of government depends on early warning, rapid
response and early involvement. Modern technology, ie. the computer, has
given us the opportunity to greatly enhance our early participation in the
political process. CMA State Affairs Division is now implementing our new
two-way computer communication system called CMA/LINC. Currently there
are 20 member companies and two state chemical industry councils actively
participating.
It should be noted, however, that many of the state CICs will need
additional funding for their effective participa tion in this vital
communications network. Member companies are strongly encouraged to
provide this needed support.
The state advocacy program* including the new CMA/LINC computer
network, will be heavily involved in 1986 in the critical environmental
issues identified by the National Conference of State Legislators, namely,
groundwater and the disposal of hazardous wastes. Of course, other issues
will continue to be of major concern such as state superfunds which are
currently under detailed study by the CMA State Hazardous
Waste/Groundwater Task Group.
State right-to-know action continues to grow and even expand in
scope. New Jersey's "Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act", signed in early
January, not only requires the reporting of information concerning
industry's operations but also allows the state to order risk reduction
measures or even order the cessation of operations. Toxic air will become
even more important at the state level as Federal EPA pushes this issue
along with groundwater to the states. CMA's State Affairs program has
been an active participant in CMA's development of an air toxics policy.
A new, but rapidly growing issue at the state and federal level is
liability insurance and the related issue of tort reform. CMA's State
Affairs program is actively participating in a large coalition of
interested trade associations and individual companies under the auspices
of the American Legislative Exchange Council. Nearly all states are
involved in some aspect of this issue. Of course, hazardous material
transportation, public compensation and chronic health issues will
continue to be active issues as well in 1986.
Media
Page

CMA 038607
The closing months of 1985 saw concentrated media attention on the
subject of air toxics. The first anniversary of Bhopal and related
activities of environmental groups, the EPA hazardous chemicals listing
and, in depth media analysis, made headlines at the same time.
Reauthori2ation of Superfund probably gained more media attention
than expected, primarily because of its intrusion into the budget
reconciliation process. Most of this attention was in the form of news
rather than editorial coverage.
1985 - as might have been anticipated following the December 1984
Bhopal accident - became a year of intense environmental inquiry. Initial
interest was in the potential for acute incidents in the United States.
Stories focused on questions of failure to regulate or inadequacy of
existing law. For the media, the Institute, W.V. release answered the
question "can it happen here?" Attention to "acute" threats accelerated in
their Bhopal retrospective. Media from chemical states such as Texas,
Louisiana, west Virginia, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania were concerned
primarily about this issue — with questions about training, process
safety and design. New Jersey attention included "chronic" issues as well
as "acute," raising the idea of affect on communities, as opposed to
workers.
For the most part our activities relating to Superfund were
proactive. Bhopal/air toxics activities were responsive.
The national media appeared to understand the chemical industry
rationale for a broad based tax and generally referred to that position in
their coverage,
in addition, those reporters who have covered the story
over a period of time agree with the industry contention that a waste
generation tax bears little relationship to hazardous waste sites.
Courts and Agency Decisions
Federal Maritime Commission. A victory I CMA, through briefs and
affidavits, convinced an Administrative Law Judge to decide that two
chemical parcel tankers were "tramps" rather than "ocean conanon carriers”
and thus exempt from antitrust laws. While this decision is likely to be
appealed to the entire Commission, it may serve as a precedent to prevent
chemical parcel tankers from obtaining antitrust exemptions for price
setting and market allocation agreements. Those activities could cost the
chemical industry 200 million dollars per year in increased rates on bulk
chemical exports and imports.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Another victoryl The Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has approved a rule on natural gas
Page
4
CMA 038608
transportation that adopts many CMA recommendations. The rule (Order No.
436) is intended to promote competition in the natural gas market by
facilitating the movement of gas from the producer to the user. When
fully implemented by the pipelines, there will be a substantial cost
savings to industrial users of gas. The annual savings for CMA members is
estimated at $300 to $750 million.
In addition, CMA and its coalition partners successfully argued
against inclusion of a new block billing mechanism in the final rule. CMA
testified that block billing would significantly raise the price of
natural gas for industrial consumers. A study submitted by CMA indicated
that annual cost to the chemical industry would be approximately $660
million. FERC's action is a major victory for CMA and other industrial
users. However, the Commission is continuing its assessment of the
advantages and disadvantages of block billing and further action is still
possible.
II. ISSUES AND PROGRAM STATUS
Hazardous Waste (Superfund)
Congressional Developments and Response
Senate Activity
The Senate passed H.R. 2005 on September 26, the Superfund
reauthorization for five years. The legislation will increase nearly
fivefold the money available to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites
by freezing the feedstock tax and imposing a broad-based excise tax on all
manufacturers.
Senator Robert Packwood (R-OR) and other members of the Finance
Committee put the Superfund funding package in the budget reconciliation
bill which passed the Senate. Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) offered an
amendment to delete the Superfund funding from the budget reconciliation
legislation, but he lost 66 to 32. The Senate, once again, strongly
confirmed its support for a broad-based tax and freezing feedstock to
finance the Superfund cleanup program.
House Activity
The House voted 391-33 on Dec. 10 to reauthorize the Superfund
cleanup program by significantly increasing the tax of chemical feedstocks
and oil. The House narrowly defeated the Ways & Means Committee's
broad-based tax which was opposed by President Reagan, most of the unions,
the environmentalists, and a broad coalition of manufacturers, with this
Page
5
CMA 038609
support, the House passed Representatives Thomas Downey's (D-NY) and Bill
Frenzel's (R-MN) amendment, 220-206, to finance the bulk of the S10.3
billion Superfund from a $2 billion tax on chemical feedstocks, S3.1
billion from a crude oil tax, $2 billion from a waste tax, SI.6 billion
from general revenues and smaller amounts from other sources.
The program provisions were a compromise of the Energy & Commerce and
Public Works & Transportation Committees proposals. They include cleanup
schedules, cleanup standards, citizen suits, settlement procedures and
right-to-know provisions including a requirement that certain companies
report annually their total releases of chemicals that can cause chronic
health hazards. The House defeated an amendment to create a federal cause
of action. Thus, neither the House or Senate bill contains victims
compensation provisions, which was a key CMA priority in Superfund
reauthorization.
The House and Senate conference on Superfund reauthorization could
begin in late January, after the conferees have been appointed. But major
concerns need to be resolved on the funding level, mechanism and program
issues. One of the major program issues to be resolved in conference is
how much discretion to give EPA. The House bill spells out in great
detail what EPA should do and when to do it, where the Senate bill
provides more general guidance.
The Superfund Task Group of CMA's Government Relations Committee will
now focus its attention on the House and Senate conferees. A strategy
will be developed and agressively implemented on the tax and program
issues.
Before Congress adjourned for the year on December 20, they made one
last effort to provide funding for the Superfund program. On December 13
the House and Senate conference on budget reconciliation began to consider
the Superfund funding issues. They agreed on a compromise of the Senate
funding mechanism (freeze feedstocks and a broad-based tax) and the House
funding level of $10 billion over five years. But when the conference
report went back to the House for approval, Represenative Dan Rostenkowski
(D-IL) successfully moved to strike the Superfund provisions because of
the broad-based tax. Until Congress ajoumed December 20 without passing
budget reconciliation, the House continued to delete Superfund and the
Senate kept insisting Superfund be included. This deadlock over the
different funding approaches approved by the House and Senate signals how
difficult the funding issue will be to resolve in 1986.
Regulatory Developments and Response
National Priority List Comments. The EMC's Superfund Implementation
Task Group submitted comments to EPA on proposed amendments to the
National Priority List. The primary CMA concern was EPA's retaining
flexibility in requiring cleanups under Superfund or RCRA. we indicated
Page
6
CMA 038610
that mandating that all cleanups be governed by one statute may be unduly
rigid and, in fact, slow down the cleanup process.
Policy Development, Analytical and Program Activities
National Contingency Plan Litigation. The EMC authorized CMA to
intervene in litigation challenging EPA's revisions to the National
Contingency Plan. CMA's concerns are:
(1) EPA including technology
standards in addition to health-based standards for purposes of
determining what are relevant cleanup standards; (2) EPA establishing
cost-effectiveness criteria inconsistent with the statute; and (3) EPA
incorporating other regulatory Agency standards for purposes of defining
the relevant cleanup standards that go beyond the statute's requirements.
Communications
Nearly all of the News Service Division's efforts and resources were
dedicated to Superfund during the October to December period. Briefings
on Superfund issues for key media continued during the period, and were
concentrated on Washington correspondents for the following newspapers and
news organizations: Associated Press, Dow Jones News Service, Charleston
(W.V.) Daily Mail, Ottaway News Service, Detroit (Mich.) Free Press,
Scripps-Howard News Services, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, Chicago
Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, Cong~-3sional Quarterly, Newhouse News
Service, and Gannett News Service.
During the last eight months of 1985, CMA officers, member-company
representatives and association staff have participated in 133 briefings
on Superfund issues in more than 70 cities.
Television and radio activity increased during the period on
Superfund issues, especially during November and December. CMA made
extensive use of its "alternative TV network," providing specially
targeted newsfeeds to key Congressional districts. Subjects covered in
the newsfeeds included the economic impact of Downey Superfund funding
proposal on chemical producers; propriety of Ways and Means Committee passed version of Superfund funding; and identification of industries
which have contributed waste to Superfund sites - that pay no Superfund
taxes. Targeted TV newsfeeds were distributed in nearly 40 key
Congressional districts. Usage, depending on the subject, ran between 26%
and 75%. Market reach of the targeted newsfeeds ranged from 1.9 million
to 4.5 million people.
Radio newsfeeds were also produced on similar Superfund issues during
the period. Usage averaged nearly 60%.
The department also assisted in preparation of written materials for
the Government Relations Staff for use during House Superfund floor
debates.

CMA 038611
Immediately prior to the House vote on Superfund the department
prepared and placed a full page advertisement in the Washington Post
urging members to vote NO on the Downey Amendment.
EPA is distributing "Cleaning Up" (CMA's waste site cleanup film) to
its regional offices for use in community relations programs. The film
has been distributed to more than 60 television stations. More than 110
prints have been sold to CMA member companies for use in community and
employee relations programs. CMA's Community Information Task Group is
launching a film distribution plan that includes CIC involvement, personal
television contacts, publicity, national platforms for screening and
promoting the film.
Hazardous Waste Management (RCRA)
Regulatory Developments and Response
Land Ban Prohibitions.
In early January, EPA will propose its first
set of rules to prohibit the disposal of many hazardous wastes in or on
the ground. Land disposal will be prohibited unless the level of of the
hazardous constituents in the waste is less than the "health based
standard" EPA will establish for over 350 hazardous constituents, or the
"best available technology" is used to treat the waste to reduce the
hazards. The RCRA Regulations Task Group will prepare comments on this
important and lengthy new rule.
Inorganic Leaching Model. On November 27, 1985, EPA issued a final
rule adopting a model that predicts the leaching, migration and
persistence of inorganic wastes in the land. EPA will use the model to
determine which inorganic materials should be listed/delisted as hazardous
wastes. The model, with some variations, will also be used to determine
which inorganic wastes will be banned from land disposal. The RCRA
Regulations Task Group commented on the proposed rule, and is reviewing
the final rule to determine whether to challenge it in court.
Organic Leaching Model. On November 27, 1985, EPA proposed a model
for predicting the leaching, migration, and persistence or organic wastes.
The methodology and intended use of the organic model is similar to the
inorganic model discussed above. The RCRA regulations Task Group is
preparing comments for filing on January 13, 1985.
Burning of Hazardous Waste in Boilers. CMA will participate in a
Keystone workshop on January 28, 1985 regarding the issue of burning
hazardous waste in boilers. A consensus may emerge that could form the
basis of a rule EPA is developing to regulate this activity. The Boiler
Work Group has prepared a regulatory proposal that CMA will present at the
Page
8
CMA 038612
Workshop. The proposal divides hazardous waste burning into three
categories with greater regulation for fuel that contains the largest
percentage of hazardous waste.
Policy Development, Analytical and Program Activities
1984 Hazardous Waste Survey. The EMC's RCRA Regulations Task Group
has published the results of the 1984 Hazardous Waste Survey of member
companies. The 1984 results show a continuing trend of decreased reliance
on landfills for disposal of hazardous waste, but an increased reliance on
incinerators for disposal. The survey trend analysis compares disposal
practices for the years 1981-1984.
1985 Hazardous Waste Survey. The EMC has authorized the RCRA
Regulations Task Group to conduct a 1985 Hazardous waste Survey of member
companies. The survey to be completed later in 1986, will provide CMA
with the most recent data on the waste disposal practices of the member
companies. The raw data and trends analyses are valuable advocacy tools
for legislative and regulatory matters concerning hazardous waste
management.
RCRA Codification Rule Litigation. The EMC authorized CMA to
intervene in litigation challenging EPA's regulations designed to codify
many of the new requirements of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments
of 1984. These regulations cover the bulk liquid ban, minimum
technological requirements, the continuing releases provision, the interim
small quantity generator provisions, the preconstruction ban, the
labelling requirements for hazardous waste fuels, the recordkeeping
requirements for hazardous waste exports, the waste minimize provisions,
and collection systems and groundwater monitoring provisions. Although
these requirements were supposed to merely codify statutory language, the
final regulations either added provisions and/or deleted certain limiting
factors.
Supreme Court Hazardous Waste Siting Litigation. The EMC has
authorized CMA filing an amicus brief in the U.S. supreme Court’s
consideration of a local ordinance banning all permanent on-site disposal
facilities within the City of Fairmont, w. Va. The questions to be
addressed by the Court are whether RCRA preempts a local ordinance's
prohibition of all disposal of hazardous waste pursuant to a federal
permit and can a locality prohibit all hazardous waste disposal within its
borders. The resolution of this case will have a long-term impact on the
way industry plans/manages its wastes.
Burning in Boilers Position Paper. The EMC approved a revised
position paper concerning regulation of the burning of hazardous wastes in
industrial boilers. The revisions reflect the 1984 Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments. The revised position paper will be used to respond to
EPA's anticipated proposed regulation of the burning of hazardous wastes
Page
9
CMA 038613
in industrial boilers.
In addition, the position paper will be used in a
CMA sponsored Keystone Conference on burning hazardous wastes in
industrial boilers. Industry, government, and environmental
representatives have been invited to participate in this consensus
development conference.
Underground Injection Control Project
EPA Regulatory Issues. The Underground Injection Control Task Group
developed a list of regulatory issues EPA needs to resolve as part of the
regulatory development process for land disposal ban decisions of
hazardous wastes disposed by underground injection. The resolution of
many of these issues may have a direct impact on whether or not certain
wastes will ultimately be allowed to be disposed by underground injection.
The questions address technical, legal, and policy issues.
UIPC Sponsored Regulatory Negotiations. CMA's Underground Injection
Control Group has been invited to participate in a Underground Injection
Practices Council (UIPC) exploratory meeting to determine if the RCRA land
disposal ban applicable to underground injection of hazardous wastes issue
is appropriate for regulatory negotiations. The initial meeting is to
determine if enough regulatory issues exist that are amenable to
meaningful and successful negotiations. A fundamental question to be
resolved at the exploratory meeting is whether all concerned parties are
willing to participate in a negotiation activity.
Litigation and Related Activities
Definition of Solid waste. CMA is challenging in the Court of
Appeals EPA's January 5, 1985 rule defining solid waste to include
materials resulting from a manufacturing process or used in a
manufacturing process that are reclaimed and reused in a "closed-loop"
manner in thd same manufacturing process. This rule would subject to the
panoply of RCRA regulation an estimated 3000 to 5000 tanks used by CMA
members in their manufacturing operations. As part of the litigation, CMA
has convinced EPA to propose an amendment to its rules that would exclude
this "closed-loop" reclamation from EPA jurisdiction. EPA proposed such
an amendment on December 16, 1985 and CMA will file comments supporting
the amendment.
Codification Rule/Corrective Action. CMA has intervened in a
challenge to EPA'S July 15, 1985 rule codifying the 1984 RCRA Amendments.
The challenge involves, among other issues, the question of to what extent
must owners of waste facilities repair the environment damaged by prior
releases. CMA is monitoring the litigation and may participate in
settlement negotiations with EPA aimed at clarifying the rule.
Air

CMA 038614
Congressional Developments and Response
House Activity. The House-passed Superfund legislation contains a
community right-to-know amendment sponsored by Rep. Bob Edgar (D-PA),
including air emissions reporting requirements.
(See further description
under "Right-to-Know".) The Edgar amendment - even if altered in
conference - will affect future air toxics legislation.
Currently the only full-scale air toxics bill is H.R. 2576, which
Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) introduced. Since Waxman held hearings on H.R.
2576 last June, he has been preoccupied with Superfund, and other issues.
In fact Waxman actively supported and worked for the Edgar amendment.
Early in 1986, Waxman reportedly plans to resume efforts toward full
scale air toxics legislation. This could mean additional hearings,
changes in H.R. 2576, or new proposals. In anticipation, Rep. John
Dingell (D-MI) continues to collect information and data from EPA and
other sources regarding air emissions and control.
CMA will address the Edgar amendment in the House and Senate
conference on Superfund, and is preparing for additional air toxics
activity in 1986.
Senate Activity. The Senate-passed Superfund legislation also
contains community right-to-know emission reporting requirements including
air emissions. CMA also will address this provision, sponsored by Senator
Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), in the conference on Superfund.
There have been no Senate hearings or full scale air toxics
proposals; however. Senate hearings on acid rain began in December 1985,
and air toxics may be the next topic in the Environment & Public Works
Committee.
Regulatory Developments and Response
Chromium Comments. The EMC's Process Emission Regulations Task Group
submitted comments to EPA on the Agency's notice of intent to list
chromium and hexavalent chromium as hazardous air pollutants. CMA's
comments focused on the technical adequacy of exposure assessments
conducted by EPA and the use of chromium in cooling towers and the need
for more technical analyses on whether the chromium emissions result in
ambient problems.
Emissions Trading Policy Petition. CMA, in conjunction with other
industry groups, has petitioned EPA to publish an emissions trading policy
more in line with the original intent negotiated between EPA and parties
challenging an earlier EPA air emissions policy. The most recent draft of
Page
11
CMA 038615
an air emissions trading policy appeared to fundamentally change course
and undercut the utility of an emissions trading policy. The goal of the
industry petition is to persuade EPA to publish an emissions trading
policy that facilitates industry growth and protects the environment.
Secondary Emissions Comments. The EMC's Process Qnission Regulations
Task Group submitted comments to EPA on a technical report on developing a
program of air regulations at hazardous waste treatment, storage and
disposal facilities. CMA's comments focused on technical aspects of
estimating air emissions from hazardous waste disposal sites. The
comments are designed to assist in developing better and more accurate
predictive models for estimating air emissions from the units comprising
waste disposal facilities.
Policy Development, Analytical and Program Activities
i
Recommended Air Toxics Legislative Principles. The EMC has approved
recommended principles for addressing federal and state air toxics
legislation. The recommended principles address both routine emissions
and accidental emissions. The principles, if adopted by the Board of
Directors, will be used in developing CMA's air toxics legislative
advocacy programs at the federal and state level.
Proposed Air Toxics Control Policy. The EMC has assisted members of
the Executive Committee in developing a proposed air toxics control
policy. As part of this activity, EMC members drafted initial versions of
the air toxics control policy, and identified various options on how such
a policy could be implemented by CMA member companies.
If approved by
CMA's Board of Directors, the EMC plans a significant education and
technical program to assist the member companies in implementing the air
toxics control policy.
Litigation and Related Activities
Benzene Litigation. CMA has submitted its brief in a court suit
brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.
(NRDC) challenging
EPA's emission standards for benzene under section 112 of the Clean Air
Act. The case revolves around the "ample margin of safety" test of
section 112. NRDC contends that EPA is required to set "zero-risk, zero
emission" standards for all carcinogens. CMA and the American Petroleum
Institute, who also is a party, are arguing in support of EPA's position
that the Agency is authorized to take cost and feasibility into account in
setting emission standards.
Radionuclides Litigation. On January 13, CMA filed its brief in a
case involving emission standards for radionuclides. This case, which
raises issues similar to those in the benzene litigation, focuses on the
"ample margin of safety" test of Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. NRDC
again argues that EPA must set "zero-risk, zero emission" standards for
Page
12
CMA 038616
r

I
all carcinogens. CMA counters that EPA has flexibility under the statute
to consider cost and feasibility in setting emission standards.
Vinyl Chloride Litigation. CMA previously intervened in a court suit
brought by NRDC challenging EPA's emission standards for vinyl chloride.
This case probably will be the first to decide the meaning of the "ample
margin of safety" test in section 112 of the Clean Air Act. All briefs
have been filed and a decision is expected this spring.
Communications
The department prepared a summary and question and answer document on
the Dingell Survey.
Surface Water
Congressional Developments and Response
Conference on Clean Water Act Amendments. Conference on the Senate
and House versions of S. 1128 may occur before conference on Superfund.
The timing depends upon resolution of the controversy over construction
grants funding, which is not an issue of direct concern to CMA.
CMA's five major issues, on which the Clean Water Act Task Group has
begun distributing technical papers and discussing improvements needed by
the conferees, are the following:
o
Compliance Deadlines - CMA supports the House version applying a 3 1/2
years deadline.
o
Penalties - CMA supports the House version providing for administrative
penalty hearing (APA) procedures; fairer size of maximum administrative
civil penalties; citizen suit preclusion relative to administrative
penalties; fairer size of maximum judicial civil penalties; and,
affirmative defense protection against criminal penalties.
o
Fundamentally Different Factors (FDF) Variances - CMA supports the
House version allowing use of FDF compared to the almost totally
restrictive Senate version.
o
Post-Best Available Technology (BAT) Requirements - CMA prefers the
Senate version providing more time and state responsibility.
o
Storm water Permits - CMA supports the House version which better
targets the types of discharges that should be permitted and provides
for a better regulatory program.

OCPSF Effluent Guidelines Comments. EMC's Effluent Guidelines Task
Group developed comprehensive comments on EPA’s proposed revisions to the
organic chemicals, plastics, and synthetic fibers (OCPSF) effluent
guidelines. CMA's comments highlight technical problems in EPA's
regulatory proposals and offer constructive alternatives to achieve the
same environmental results. CMA's comments concentrate on EPA's failure
to reflect the high levels of waste water treatment already in existence
and the enormous additional costs that might be imposed with minimal
environmental benefit to meet the proposed limits. Representatives of CMA
and its member companies met with EPA's Assistant Administrator for water
and discussed CMA's concern with the proposed revisions to the OCPSF
effluent guidelines.
Stormwater Permit Regulations Comments. EMC's Water Permits Task
Group submitted comments to EPA on proposed revisions to the NPDES
stormwater regulations. CMA comments indicate general support for EPA's
"general permit" approach, but offers several modifications to remedy some
industry concerns. CMA representatives discussed our recommedations with
EPA staff during the comment period. Generally, the proposed revisions,
if modified in the final regulations, will be a reasonable stormwater
regulatory requirement.
Priority Pollutant Listing/Delisting Comments. The EMC's Water
Quality Criteria and Standards Task Group, in conjunction with the
Phthalate Esters Panel, has developed comments on EPA's report
establishing a ranking list of Section 307(a) priority pollutants. The
report offers industry an opportunity to delist certain chemicals from the
Section 307(a) priority list and subsequent regulation under various Clean
Water Act provisions. The Phthalate Esters Panel has been actively
involved in this project because the EPA draft technical publication
concerning phthalate esters expressly allowed a delisting procedure.
EPA Biomonitoring Studies Comments. EMC's Water Quality Criteria and
Standards Task Group submitted comments to EPA on a recent biomonitoring
study involving the Kanawah River. CMA's comments addressed several
scientific and technical deficiencies with the study and offered
recommendations on how to cure several of them. The biomonitoring
activity is of special concern to many member companies since EPA regional
offices are incorporating biomonitoring requirements as part of second
round NPDES permits.
Litigation and Related Legal Activities
Stormwater Litigation. On August 29, EPA decided to make a major
change in the deadline for submitting stormwater permit applications under
the Clean Water Act. The original date had been April 26, 1985. However,
CMA and other industry groups mounted a major effort to convince EPA that
the deadline was unreasonable. CMA member companies participated in the
effort by contacting EPA and documenting the practical problems posed by
Page
14
CMA 038618
the deadline. On August 29, EPA agreed with our position, changing the
deadline to December 31, 1986 for industrial (Group I) discharges and June
30, 1987 for other (Group II) discharges. However, the Natural Resources
Defense Council (NRDC) has now filed suit challenging the deadline
extension. Since the extension is very important to industry and rests
substantially upon concerns brought to EPA's attention by industry, CMA
and the other trade associations that have been involved with the
stormwater issue have decided to intervene in NRDC's case, in support of
EPA . we will jointly present the argument that EPA was justified in
extending the deadline in order to remedy serious practical defects in the
original stormwater regulations.
Pesticides Effluent Guidelines Litigation. On October 4, EPA issued
effluent guidelines and standards under the Clean Water Act for the
pesticides industry. Because of the strong connections between the
pesticides and organic chemicals industries, several generic regulatory
issues addressed in the pesticides rules are also important in the ongoing
rulemaking for the organic chemicals, plastics and synthetic fibers
(OCPSF) industry. CMA has therefore decided to participate in litigation
on the pesticide regulations, since any judicial decision on those
questions in the pesticide context will surely serve as precedent for
EPA's regulation of OCPSF plants. In the litigation, CMA will be working
closely with other affected industry groups and companies to coordinate
efforts and, to the extent possible, present a united industry position on
the important issues to be briefed.
Groundwater (Includes Safe Drinking Water Act)
Congressional Developments and Response
JSafe Drinking Water
Congress is expected to give final approval early in 1986 to a Safe
Drinking Water Act reauthorization that would significantly strengthen the
federal law that protects the quality of drinking water.
On May 16, the Senate approved by voice vote a Senate bill (S. 124)
sponsored by Senator Dave Durenberger (R-MN). On June 17, the House by
voice vote approved a House proposal (H.R. 1650) introduced by Rep.
Edward R. Madigan (R-IL). Both bills would set deadlines for the
Environmental Protection Agency to regulate drinking water contaminants,
require monitoring for unregulated contaminants, and establish a
demonstration program for planning to protect aquifers that are the sole
or principal source of a community's drinking water.
After the early action the House and Senate conference was delayed
repeatedly because staff and members were busy with Superfund, clean water
and other issues.
Staffers remain optimistic that differences over
Page
IS
CMA 038619
standard-setting, groundwater, judicial review and funding provisions will
be resolved. The House bill would require states to develop and adopt
plans to protect all present and potential underground sources of drinking
water. Also, the House bill has significantly lower authorization levels.
EPA objects to most of the main provisions of both bills, arguing they
would lessen the agency's discretion and are unnecessary.
CMA has supported the Senate bill over the House version on three
issues: standard setting, no comprehensive groundwater protection
program, and the Senate critical aquifer demonstration program instead of
the House sole source.
Groundwater
Senator Dave Durenberger (R-MN) has held 6 hearings leading toward
the introduction of his groundwater protection bill early in 1986.
Senators George Mitchell (D-ME) and Max Baucus (D-MT) introduced
their groundwater protection bill on November 7, 1985, S. 1836, primarily
to begin the discussions in the groundwater debate. This bill would
require states to have their own groundwater protection programs and to
establish groundwater quality standards, with assistance from the Federal
Government. CMA is currently working on an analysis of the
Mitchell/Baucus bill.
The National Groundwater Policy Forum, led by Gov. Bruce Babbitt of
Arizona, announced its legislative recommendations. These
recommendations, together with Senator Mitchell's and Senator
Durenberger's bills, will likely serve as the initial focal point for the
groundwater legislative debate next year. CMA is in the process of
completing an analysis of the Forum's proposal.
Regulatory Developments and Response
EPA Health Advisories Comments. The EMC's Groundwater Management
Task Group submitted comments to EPA on the Agency's generic approach to
health advisories and detailed comments on 25 chemical-specific health
advisories. CMA's comments identified concerns and deficiencies with
several assumptions, inclusion of some data, and specific health
advisories language. The final health advisories will be used in
developing drinking water criteria that will be used in developing state
drinking water standards.
Policy Development, Analytical and Program Activities
Recommended Maximum Contaminant Levels Litigation. The EMC
authorized CMA to participate in a judicial challenge of EPA's recently
published recommended maximum contaminant levels (RMCL). For several
Page
16
CMA 038620
substances, EPA has set the RMCL at zero. These limits are important
health-based standards that will serve as precedents for regulation of
many chemicals used or manufactured by member companies. The EMC's
Groundwater Management Task Group has identified several serious technical
flaws in EPA's standard setting methodology, and in the Agency's
interpretation and use of scientific information.
Litigation and Related Legal Activities
Safe Drinking Water Act RMCL Litigation. On November 13, EPA
promulgated final Recommended Maximum Containment Levels (RMCL's) under
the Safe Drinking Water Act for eight volatile synthetic organic chemicals
(VOC's). These chemicals are benzene, vinyl chloride, trichlorethylene,
ethylene dichloride, carbon tetrachloride, vinylidene chloride, methyl
chloroform, and p-dichlorbenzene. While the RMCL's are technically only
non-enforceable health goals,•they have critical importance for the
chemical industry, primarily because they are often used as the standards
of acceptable groundwater quality in Superfund cleanups, RCRA permitting
decisions, and state groundwater management programs.
In setting the
eight VOC RMCL's,EPA followed a strategy which resulted in the RMCL's for
five VOC's being set at zero on the basis of finding of "probably
carcinogenicity." Moreover, it appears that EPA misinterpreted scientific
data in reaching several of its conclusions regarding carcinogenicity of
these VOC's. Because of these issues, and the importance of the RMCL's,
CMA has decided to participate in litigation challenging EPA's decisions.
CMA is coordinating its efforts with other industry groups that will also
be involved in the case.
Communications
The department is working with the State Affairs Task Group of the
Groundwater Management Committee to prepare an information brochure on
groundwater for use at the state level.
Regulation of Chemicals (TSCA and related)
Regulatory Developments and Response
Response to TSCA Section 4 Generic Testing issues. Positions on two
generic testing issues were developed by the Hazard Assessment Task
Group, with the intent that the positions be used in CMA discussions with
EPA or as CMA positions on proposed rules or legislative issues related
to tests.
o
Issuet Use of TSCA Section 4 to require the testing of substances
used as inert pesticide ingredients.
Position;
The Task Group concluded that EPA cannot justify
Page
17
CMA 038621
Section 4 test rules solely on the basis of use of a chemical
substance as a pesticide inert. A chemical substance would be
regulated under TSCA only up to the point in its life cycle where
it is incorporated into a pesticide formulation.
Subsequent to
its incorporation, the inert ingredient becomes part of a FIFRA
pesticide formulation and is regulated appropriately under FIFRA.
This CMA position was approved by the Health and Safety Committee
at their November meeting.
o
Issue;
Use of TSCA Section 4 to require monitoring for the
presence of chemical substances.
Position; EPA does not have the authority under Section 4 to
require monitoring or analytical tests because Section 4(a) is
limited to testing of the health and environmental effects of
chemical substances and mixtures.
Recognizing, however, that
reliable human and environmental exposure data may be necessary
for a sound assessment of risks presented by a chemical, CMA will,
as a matter of policy, work with EPA to to develop monitoring and
analytical information when it is needed. This position was
approved by the Health and Safety Conmittee at their December
meeting.
Quality Assurance. At the request of the Hazard Assessment Task
Group, CMA co-sponsored a conference in November with AIHC in Raleigh,
North Carolina, entitled "Managing Conduct and Data Quality of Toxicology
Studies." The conference was a joint industry-government sponsored
venture, and established a dialogue between toxicology testing groups in
government and industry. Quality assurance programs and GLP issues were
discussed. Proceedings will be forthcoming in 1986.
Comprehensive Reporting. On December 20, 1985, CMA filed comments on
the second draft of the form developed for the comprehensive assessment
information rule. Although the form was a, great improvement over the
first draft, CMA reiterated its recommendation that the Agency coordinate
the collection and management of data before implementing this broad
reporting rule. CMA will meet with the Agency as the proposed rule enters
Agency review in February.
New Chemical follow-up. The Conservation Foundation's Toxic
Substances Dialogue Group, of which CMA is a member, has recommended that
EPA implement a new approach to following the commercial development of
new chemicals. The procedure recommended by the Dialogue Group would
allow EPA to more easily follow, and if necessary regulate, changes in
manufacture or use that occur after a new chemical has been through Agency
review of the premanufacture notice and then manufactured for commercial
purposes. CMA and other members of the Dialogue Group will meet with EPA
in January to discuss the proposal.

EPA's Methods for Assessing Occupational Exposure.
The Health and
Safety Committee's Exposure Assessment Task Group reviewed and critiqued
EPA's methods for assessing occupational exposure to chemicals.
The
Exposure Assessment Task Group proposed modifications to dispersion
assessments, particularly in particle aerodynamics, to improve the
accuracy of EPA's assessments.
Evaluation of Exposure Assessment Methods.
The Exposure Assessment
Task Group has begun an evaluation of exposure assessment methods used by
government and industry.
The project will determine the validity and
appropriate uses of the assessment methods, and will improve the accuracy
of exposure assessments done as a part of the regulatory process.
The
evaluation will also highlight critical data gaps and assumptions.
These
can then be targeted as high priority research areas.
The evaluation of
exposure methods will make it less necessary to rely on "worst case"
assumptions in the exposure assessments that form the foundation of many
regulations.
Food and Drug Administration Syn^osium.
The Health and Safety
Committee's Risk Assessment Task Group provided scientific information to
the Food and Drug Administration's symposium on Interspecies Extrapolation
of Carcinogenicity Data.
The symposium identified scientific advances in
extrapolating laboratory experiments to human experience,
information
provided by the Risk Assessment Task Group included qualitative
extrapolation between species, factors that contribute to differences in
response between species, approaches that have been used in the past, and
potentially productive areas for future research.
Health and Safety Reporting.
On November 27, 1985, CMA submitted
comments to EPA on its proposals to amend the requirements for submitting
health and safety data under section 8(d) of TSCA.
CMA agreed that there
are circumstances that will justify extending the period of reporting for
certain chemicals, but objected to EPA's proposal to extend most reporting
from 3 years to 10 years.
CMA also took exceptions to EPA's proposal to
require companies to list studies that have already been submitted to
other offices within EPA.
For studies already submitted to other federal
agencies, we urged EPA to begin implementing the interagency coordination
provisions of section 10 of TSCA to relieve companies of the burden of
duplicative submissions.
Procedural Rules for Negotiated Testing.
In August, 1985, CMA and
the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) jointly submitted to EPA for
official approval a draft procedural rule to allow EPA and manufacturers
to negotiate toxicity testing requirements.
The draft was the product of
several meetings involving CMA, NRDC, and EPA staff.
Senior EPA officials
are now reviewing a final version that copies the draft almost exactly.
The final version is expected to be promulgated in February, 1986.
It
will re-establish negotiations as a legitimate procedure for deciding what
Page
19
CMA 038623
testing needs to be done.
It also represents the occasional value of
direct discussion with a national environmental organization.
Biotechnology Developments.
CMA staff counsel, as well as several
member company representatives, are participating in a Keystone Center
dialogue on the regulation of biotechnology.
The initial meeting at
Keystone occurred in October; others are planned for winter, spring, and
summer of 1986.
In the meantime, on November 14, 1985, the Office of
Science and Technology Policy announced the creation of a Biotechnology
Science Coordinating Committee within OSTP to coordinate among federal
agencies and promote consistent policies.
More recently , Senators
Durenburger (R-MN) and Baucus (D-MT) introduced S.
1967, The Biosafety
Act, which would amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to establish a
permit system for genetically engineered microorganisms and to give a
statutory charter to the Biotechnology Science Coordinating Committee.
International Regulation
U.S./Sweden Consultations.
On October 22-23, 1985, the
International Affairs Group (IAG) participated as industry
advisors to the U.S. Governmental Delegation at bilateral
consultations with the Swedish Government on its "New Act on
Chemical Products in Sweden".
The consultations were held in
Stockholm.
IAG had previously submitted comments on the New
Act to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).
The comments address a number of chemical notification, testing,
confidentiality and labeling issues, as well as suggested
amendments on cheaiical inventory compilation and exemptions from
notification.
Consultations with Japanese on Chemical Testing.
On
November 19, 1985, the IAG met with a Japanese Delegation
(from Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
and the Japan Chemical Industry Assiciation (JCIA)) to
discuss the forthcoming revisions to the Japanese Chemical
Substances Control Law.
The central issue of the agenda was
whether Japan will adopt a base-set (European style) test
requirement or adopt a case-by-case philosophy (TSCA style)
for testing of new chemicals.
The Japanese chemical industry
privately opposes the base-set philosophy but yields to the
Government and the academic proponents of such a requirement.
As a consequence of our meeting, a detailed text was prepared
and submitted formally by members of the Dow Japan staff to MITI,
summarizing IAG's concerns and recommendations against the
adoption of the base set approach in Japan.

European Community Preparations Directive.
The IAG has
submitted its views to the U.S. Government regarding the European
Council's Directive Relating to the Classification, Packaging and
Labeling of Dangerous Preparations.
Aided by counsel, a cooperative
effort between IAG and the Health and Safety Committee has yielded
a set of comments which were submitted to USTR, the Departments of
State and Commerce, and EPA on January 7, 1986.
The comments
relate to confidentiality, labeling and product liability concerns
with the Directive, as well as the economic burdens of compliance
on the chemical industry.
Australian Chemical Law.
The IAG will address new developments
on the Australian Chemical Registration Law which have been under
consideration for several months and appear to be in a nearly
finalized form that should be published within the next three
months.
Public Compensation
(Risk, Health and related issues)
Congressional Developments and Response
House Superfund Activity.
On December 10, the House of
Representatives defeated an amendment to add a federal cause of action to
the Superfund reauthorization bill.
The amendment, offered by
Representative Barney Frank (D-MA), would have allowed claimants to sue in
federal court for health or property damage allegedly caused by exposure
to hazardous wastes.
Companies- sued would have been absolutely liable for
any damages.
The House vote assures that the Superfund reauthorization bill will
not include a public compensation provision.
In considering its version
of a Superfund bill two months earlier, the Senate voted against
establishing a compensation fund as part of a "demonstration program." The
House and Senate votes are a significant victory for CMA, which actively
worked to prevent passage of a costly new compensation program.
Product Liability.
CMA submitted comments on the second draft (Staff
working Draft #2) of the product liability bill circulated by Senate
Commerce Committee Chairman John Danforth (R-MO.) These comments commend
Senator Danforth for seeking product liability reform and for
incorporating many of the suggestions offered to the previous draft.
Nevertheless, Staff Draft #2 remains seriously flawed.
The principle
problem is with causation.
A new presumption (a 30% increase in the
incidence of a disease establishes causation) would impose liability even
though there is only a small chance of actual responsibility.
In
addition, the proposal lacks fundamental due process.
A determination of
causation by a newly created National Toxic Health Effects Panel would be
Page
21
CMA 038625
unreviewable and beyond the challenge of parties on either side.
Hearings
on the draft proposal are expected in late February or early March.
Insurance Issues Developments and Response
Environmental Liability Insurance.
CMA assisted in the preparation
of a report to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)
on environmental liability insurance.
The NAIC is an organization of
state insurance regulatory officials, with active participation by state
insurance commissioners.
The NAIC report deals with the background and history of the
environmental liability insurance problem, outlines the legislative and
judicial developments affecting the marketplace, and assesses current
market conditions.
CMA participation in the NAIC effort assured the
development of a fair and balanced report.
Work is now underway on the second phase of the project, which is to
make appropriate recommendations to the NAIC on how to address the
environmental liability insurance problem.
Occupational and Public Safety
Congressional Developments and Response
Worker Right-to-Know.
Rep. Joe Gaydos' (D-PA) Health and Safety
Subcommittee held additional hearings last October and November on his
High Risk Occupational Disease Notification and Prevention Act, H.R.
1309.
This bill would require the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) to establish a system for identifying, notifying
and preventing illness among workers who are exposed to increased risk of
occupational disease.
Medical experts from the Monsanto Co. and Dow Coming testified on
behalf of CMA October 9.
We supported the general goals of H.R. 1309 but
strongly opposed its specifics, especially its trigger mechanism for
determining "elevated risks" of occupational disease,
other industry
groups and the Administration testified and took a similar approach.
Backed by solid organized labor support, Mr. Gaydos still plans to
mark up the bill and report it from the subcommittee in the Spring of
1986.
A CMA technical task group is developing responsive positions that
can be used to work constructively with subcommittee members and their
staff.
Community Right-to-Know (RTK).
Last September, the Senate passed the
Superfund reauthorization bill, H.R. 2005, including community RTK
amendments sponsored by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ).
CMA and its
Page
22
CMA 038626
member companies worked with Lautenberg to achieve more practical
emergency response provisions generally consistent with our CAER
initiatives.
Also included were somewhat narrower hazardous substance
inventory emissions/discharge reporting requirements, which still need
more improvements in the conference.
On December 10, 1985, the House of Representatives passed its
Superfund reauthorization, H.R. 2817.
The community RTK requirements are
based on material safety data sheets, emergency response provisions are
basically consistent with the CMA CAER/NCRIC programs, and we supported
the essential features of those two provisions.
But a third element was
added:
emissions/discharge reporting.
We succeeded initially in limiting
th list of extremely toxic substances, for which such reporting would be
required, to only those substances so acutely toxic that their release
in any amount would present an imminent and substantial endangerment to
human health.
Also included was language permitting a company to utilize
reasonable estimates rather than expensive direct monitoring for meeting
the reporting requirements.
Eventually however, the list of extremely
toxic substances was broadened by a floor amendment sponsored by
Congressman Robert Edgar (D-PA) to include substances causing adverse
chronic health effects.
CMA has not argued that there is no need for any emissions/discharge
reporting.
However, we did contend that hastily adding"^sticiv-reporting to
Superfund would be premature and detract from the bill's main purpose:
the clean up of hazardous waste sites.
CMA worked with a coalition of
allied industry groups with a small business focus, led by the Synthetic
Organic Chemicals Association (SOCMA) in support of efforts by key
Congressmen John Dingell (D-MI), James Broyhill (R-NC) and Gene Snyder
Despite these efforts, which included state and local officials,
the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the Administration (EPA
and the White House), the Edgar amendment finally prevailed on the House
floor by one vote margin:
211-210.
CMA will be working with the industry coalition to achieve reasonable
reporting criteria in the House/Senate Conference on Superfund.
Policy Development, Analytical and Program Activities
Safety Guides.
In response to requests from member companies, the
Health and Safety Committee, through its Safety Programs Task Group, is
updating CMA's discontinued Safety Guide series.
The revised publications
will assist member companies in addressing certain important safety
questions.
The revised publications will focus on safety techniques.
In
addition to new versions of sixteen of the original "Guides", new
documents on the storage and handling of hazardous substances and site
emergency response are being eagerly anticipated by CAER participants.
Process Safety Seminars.
HSC's Process Safety Analysis Task Group
Page
23
CMA 038627
has conducted two Process Safety Management seminars during the past
years, with the third scheduled for February 13, 1986.
These overviews of
programs and techniques have been uniformly well attended and
enthusiastically received.
The February presentation is being opened to
non-CMA participants; a large turnout of government regulatory agency
personnel is anticipated.
Revision of ANSI Z129.1;
Hazardous Industrial Chemicals Precautionary Labeling.
The Labeling Task Group of the Health and Safety
Committee began its revision of the ANSI Standard on precautionary
labeling in the fall of 1985.
Among the additions to be incorporated in
the voluntary standard are chronic hazard language and symbol
recommendations.
The Projected date of completion is early 1987.
Litigation and Related Legal Activities
New Jersey Right-to-Know Litigation.
On October 11, 1985, the Third
Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision in the appeal of a district
court decision.
The Court held the hazard communication standard
preempted the New Jersey Right-to-Know law as it applied to manufacturers.
In January of 1985, Judge Dickinson Debevoise rendered the preemption
decision in New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce v, Hughey.
The Court of
Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, the district court
decision.
The Court held:
(1) the hazard communication standard preempts the New Jersey law as it
pertains to protection of employee health safety in the manufacturing
sector;
(2) there is no preemption insofar as the New Jersey law applies to
employers outside the manufacturing sector or insofar as it requires
identification and reporting of environmental hazards;
(3) the Court remanded to the district court the question of whether
the environmental hazard labeling requirements are subject to implied
preemption; and
(4) upheld the New Jersey law's trade secret of protection.
The Court said its holding in United Steelworkers v. Auchter compels
a ruling that the hazard communication standard preempts the New Jersey
law with respect to disclosure to employees in the manufacturing sector.
The question left unresolved by the Steelworkers decision is to what
extent the other provisions of the New Jersey law are preempted by the
hazard communication standard.
The Court also said other provisions could be preempted under the
doctrine of implied preemption: (1) if it is impossible to comply with
Page
24
CMA 038628
both federal and state requirements, or (2)
Congressional purpose.
if enforcement will thwart
The questions remanded to the district court have not yet been
answered.
Although parties have held a pretrial conference, a decision on
the issue of environmental labeling requirements is not expected in the
near future.
Community Awareness and Emergency Response
Regulatory Developments and Response
On December 17, 1985, the Environmental Protection Agency officially
released its "Chemical Emergency Preparedness Program Interim Guidance"
Along with the guidance document, EPA released a list of 402
acutely toxic chemicals and chemical profiles.
This voluntary program is
"intended to help local communities become aware of any acutely toxic
chemicals in their area and prepare to respond to any accidental release
of such chemicals into the air." The agency will accept written comments
on the CEPP for a 90 day period.
CMA task groups will review the package
and comment to EPA.
While developing this program, the agency invited comments and advice
from CMA and others.
EPA included many of CMA's suggestions.
The overall
objectives of the program are compatible with CAER and will complement the
chemical industry's efforts by helping us implement our program,
in fact,
the agency guidance document specifically describes the CAER program and
looks to it as the industry's way of improving community contingency
planning.
CMA has distributed the guidance document, list of chemicals
^and chemical profiles to company CAER coordinators.
On November is, 1985, CMA participated in a national teleconference
with EPA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal
agencies.
The purpose of the teleconference was to describe EPA's CEPP,
CMA's CAER and other emergency response programs and to show how they can
work cooperatively.
Policy Development and Program Activity
On November 12, 1985, CMA President Roland sent a letter to executive
contacts of CMA member firms.
Roland asked the executive contacts to
do two things.
First to check with their CAER coordinator to assure that
they have submitted initial milestone reports to CMA.
At that time, only
93 of the 174 participating companies had reported.
Second, he asked the
contacts to support their CAER coordinators and plant managers by making
sure they have the resources to make the program successful.
Also, he
recommended that the executive contacts make CAER a part of their
companies' operating procedures.
To date, 119 companies out of 174
Page
25
CMA 038629
participating in the program have reported.
Those companies have selected
over 1,100 sites to participate in CAER.
Over 50% of those sites have
initiated community coordinating groups.
The CAER Task Group is coordinating the program's implementation with
allied trade associations and others to broaden direct support for CAER.
In addition to meeting with the Council of Chemical Associations,
presentations were made to:
the National Association of Chemical
Distributors, the Chlorine Institute, the Chemical Marketing Research
Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the American Petroleum
Institute.
Future meetings will include the Synthetic Organic Chemical
Manufacturers Association, the Chemical Specialties Manufacturers
Association, the National Paint and Coatings Association, and the National
Association of Towns and Townships.
International Aspects
World Environment Center.
The dialogue between the International
Affairs Group and the World Environment Center continues as to how best to
translate the CAER document into usable texts for Third World country
applications.
The IAG has discussed the possibility of working with Latin
American chemical industry associations to provide a Spanish translation
of CAER for Latin American use.
Outreach Activity
Several state chemical organizations working with CMA have held CAER
workshops;
Florida, California, Ohio and New Jersey have put on workshops
that have focused on local implementation of CAER.
These workshops have
typically included local industry and emergency response officials who
discussed CAER case histories.
The Texas and Michigan chemical industry
councils have scheduled CAER workshops for early 1986.
Communications
The 35-page briefing package, "One Year After Bhopal" , was
distributed to a mailing list of 1000.
The package reviews industry
initiatives to improve process safety, transportation safety, emergency
preparedness and community awareness of chemical risks and hazards.
An update on the progress of the industry on programs announced last
April - CAER and NCRIC - was sent to all editorial board contacts in
anticipation of possible editorials concerning a one year Bhopal
anniversary.
Material went to nearly 200 writers.

Hazardous Materials Transportation.
Reauthorization of the Hazardous
Materials Transportation Act is gaining momentum within Congress.
Several
groups representing shipper, carrier, emergency response, and public
interests are all gearing their activities towards generating significant
changes to the existing legislation.
Three primary groups have emerged:
the Office of Technology Assessment's Hazardous Materials Committee; the
DOT'S Hazardous Materials Transportation Advisory Committee; and the
Hazardous Materials Coalition.
CMA is represented on all three groups.
CMA is concerned about the push to establish a federal fund for
emergency response training and equipment.
Local authorities are
generally the first on the scene of transportation accidents involving
hazardous products.
Their representatives claim that industry funding is
necessary to ensure that they are adequately equipped and trained to
properly respond to such emergencies.
The chemical industry has countered
with extensive voluntary resources to meet this need.
CMA has strongly supported the recommendations calling for regulatory
consistency among federal, state and local authorities over the
transportation of hazardous materials.
This national regulatory
consistency, coupled with increased enforcement, will contribute greatly
towards enhancing hazardous material transportation safety.
It will also
prove economical to industry in that compliance with only a single set of
requirements would be required.
The first reauthorization bill, H.R.
3779, sponsored by
Representative Gonzales, has been referred jointly to the House Committees
on Public works and Transportation, Energy and Commerce, and Ways and
Means.
It represents the worst case scenario.
The bill would establish a
,federal Emergency Response Fund financed by industry, and advanced
notification of shipment, registration and routing.
While referencing
uniformity of regulations, the bill does not explicitly call for uniform
federal, state and local transportation regulations.
CMA is determining
whether this bill will receive favorable consideration in Congress, and
will act accordingly.
Water Resources Development Act.
CMA submitted detailed comments to
Congress on the provisions of the Water Resources Development Act, S.1567,
regarding the imposition of an ad valorem tax on imports and exports.
Specifically, CMA called for Congress to impose a cap on the tax for all
exports and shipments between U.S.
ports.
Further, CMA urged Congress to
avoid double taxation for cargo unloaded and reloaded onto a vessel at the
same harbor
Conrail Acquisition.
CMA formally notified Congress that it supports
the transfer of Conrail to the public sector.
CMA expressed the position
that between the existing sale options, Morgan Stanley and Norfolk
Southern, the public offering advanced by the Morgan Stanley group comes
Page
27
CMA 038631
closest to satisfying the chemical industry's concerns, provided Conrail
operates consistent with the language and spirit of the new Ex Parte 445
rules of the ICC that promote rail-to-rail competition.
CMA explicitly opposed the transfer of Conrail to a major Eastern
Railroad.
Such action would reduce rail-to-rail competition to an
unacceptable level.
Shipping Act of 1984.
CMA is continuing to seek an amendment to the
Shipping Act of 1984 that would exclude all chemical parcel tankers from
the antitrust exemption to set rates and designate markets.
This would
eliminate case-by-case litigation on carrier action as was the case with
the recent decision in Andino/Flota.
(See Chemical Parcel Tankers in
Section J.5)
Cargo Liability Bills.
CMA is developing a position to support
legislation that would modify ocean cargo liability laws.
CMA favors
clarifying liability limits so that they apply to packaged units within a
container, not to the 40-foot container.
CMA also favors legislation
based on the Hamburg Rules since they encourage ship owners to take proper
care of cargo.
Regulatory Developments and Response
HM 196.
A new Work Group has been formed to coordinate efforts in
complying with this final DOT rule pertaining to the transportation of
chemicals that pose poison inhalation hazards.
Specific concerns the Work
Group will address include:
types of packings that can be used to
transport these materials; information required by DOT to obtain approval
for these packagings; short acute toxicity data; and the determination of
which materials need additional toxicity testing.
The work group will
also explore the feasibility of sharing the cost of this testing.
Rail To Rail Competition.
The Interstate Commerce Commission has
published its new rules pertaining to competitive access of railroads to
shipping facilities.
These new rules reflect the major points agreed to
and submitted by CMA and the rail industry.
In the first test of the Commission's new rules, the Midtec Case has
been reopened.
It will address the Use of Terminal Facilities and
Reciprocal Switching arrangements by a competing railroad.
To ensure the
chemical industry's concerns are made a part of the record in this
proceeding, CMA has petitioned the Commission for leave to intervene.
Conrail Acquisition.
Norfolk Southern presented the federal
government with a revised divestiture plan for the Conrail system.
Following careful analysis of this new plan, CMA reaffirmed its support
for the public offering proposal presented by the Morgan Stanley
investment group.
CMA's support for the public offering, as being the
Page
28
CMA 038632
only existing proposal that would maintain rail competition in the
Northeast region of the country, was conveyed to DOT Secretary Dole and
Congress on December 4, 1985.
amendments to Cargo Tank Specifications.
In response to the
Department of Transportation's proposed new specifications for cargo
tanks, CMA has formed a work group to submit an impact statement.
The
proposed requirements call for significant changes in the manufacture,
operation, maintenance, repair and requalification of all specification
cargo tanks used to transport bulk shipments of chemicals and other
hazardous materials by highway.
Brazil Cargo Reservation.
The United States has agreed with Brazil
to renew for one year their bilateral agreement that condones Brazilian
laws requiring nearly 80 percent of U.S.
exports and imports to be
transported on high-priced Brazilian or U.S.
flag vessels.
Some minor
modifications favoring shippers were made to the bilateral agreement.
Most significantly, the U.S.
told the Brazilians that the anticompetitive
nature of the Brazilian cargo reservation laws must be significantly
liberalized or the agreement will not be renewed again next year.
CMA
staff attended the negotiations as a shipper observer.
CMA will continue
to seek liberalization of the cargo reservation system over the next year.
Emergency Response Training and Equipment.
In an effort to develop
detailed information showing the amount of training and equipment the
chemical industry is making available to emergency responders, the
Distribution Committee is developing a member company questionnaire.
This
information will prove particularly useful in the reauthorization hearings
for the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.
Tank Truck Corrosion.
Discussions are continuing with tank truck
operators over the development of an educational program designed to
reduce premature deterioration of tank trucks due to corrosion.
Rates and Compensation
Tank Car Compensation.
The Commission asked the Joint Negotiating
Committee to address three matters with respect to the prescription of a
national tank car mileage allowance system.
These matters were:
the
market sensibility of the proposed system; quantification that the new
formula will reduce the gap in allowances between older and newer cars;
and, a comparison of the allowances paid under the proposed formula, the
1979 formula and the interim formula.
These comments were submitted on
November 4, 1985.
Objection to these comments were expressed by WFIX and
CF Industries.
CMA joined the other car providers and filed a response to
the objections.
CMA is considering supporting the formation of a negotiating group to
represent all the interested car providers.

Litigation and Related Legal Activities
Chemical Parcel Tankers.
CMA recently won a case before an
administrative law judge of the Federal Maritime Commission.
The judge
decided that two carriers in the US/Columbian trade should not be given
antitrust immunity to establish a joint chemical parcel tanker operation.
Assuming the case is not reversed on appeal, it will serve as a strong
precedent that chemical parcel tankers may not collectively set rates or
allocate markets.
CMA, which filed extensive briefs before the
administrative law judge, will file a brief in the appeal in order to
protect the victory.
CMA is also seeking an amendment to the Shipping Act
of 1984 which would prohibit rate setting and market allocation by
chemical parcel tankers.
National Chemical Response and information Center (NCRIC)
All elements of the National Chemical Response and Information Center
were on line by the end of December.
Although much work remains to be
done to insure maximum participation by the membership and use by the
public, the center was completed on schedule.
CHEMTREC
CHEMTREC closed out 1985 with a 17% increase in activity over 1984
levels.
A total of 35,869 calls were handled, of which 7,400 were
emergency related; non-emergency calls totaled 26,619.
Emergency related
calls received averaged 617 per month.
Non-emergency calls received are
in excess of 2,200 per month.
Medical emergencies are showing a slow but steady increase since CMA
officially announced that CHEMTREC would offer assistance to physicians
seeking treatment information.
Referrals to the Chemical Referral Center (CRC) are off to a slow
start since CRC was activated 27 December, but this is expected to
increase significantly as we enter our busy period in early spring.
CHEMNET
The CHEMNET program began operation on November 1, 1985.
At that
time we had a membership of 56.
Since that time we have added another 3
members.
Our current totals are 59 members, of which 35 are participants
and 24 are subscribers.
The participants in the CHEMNET program have designated 121 emergency
response teams to be a part of the system.
The program now includes three
contractors that are available to the membership.
The contractors have 29
Page
30
CMA 038634
teams.
In combination the system has ISO teams that are located in 35
states.
This represents a very significant resource to respond to serious
transportation incidents.
During the months of November and December, we used the CHEMNET system
once.
In that case a contractor, O.H.
Materials, responded to an event
because the shipper could not reach the scene in a reasonable amount of
time.
We expect use of the program to grow as the membership has a better
understanding of the resources it provides.
To expedite that
understanding we have scheduled a workshop on March 12, 1986, in
Washington, D.C., to provide details on the operation to the membership.
Chemical Referral Center
On December 27, 1985, the.Chemical Referral Center (CRC) began
receiving non-emergency health and safety chemical information inquiries
from the public on its "800" toll-free number.
These calls are referred
to the designated contact at the company that manufactures the product in
question.
To date, 118 chemical companies (99 are CMA members) have
provided the CRC with the company contact and product information which
are required for participation in this service.
The Center's chemical
index currently contains profiles on over 20,000 products.
This number
will rapidly increase as participating companies send the CRC the
requested information.
Emergency Response Training
First Responder Training Program.
The videotape training program for
first responders, "First On The Scene", is completed and being
distributed.
The videotape is 31 minutes long and includes a brochure and
discussion guide'.
The following five key points are stressed in the
program:
approach the scene cautiously; identify the hazards; secure the
scene; obtain help in handling the incident; and assure safe site entry.
The objective of the program is to reduce injuries and environmental
damages and to insure that first responders know where to get help in
handling the problem.
There are no restrictions on reproducing the videotape.
copies of the tape or sells them at a cost.
CMA loans
A copy of the training program has been donated to each of the ten
FEMA regions and the National Fire Academy.
Copies are also being
distributed to the State fire and police instructors.
Lending Library.
The lending library of audio-visual training aids
for emergency response personnel has become an extremely successful
Page
31
CMA 038635
program.
Requests to borrow the programs have been received from
emergency response personnel and state agencies from all over the United
States.
10,000 copies of the brochure listing the programs have been
distributed.
Additional copies of some programs purchased were to meet
all requests.
Three new programs have been added to the library.
A new
brochure, being printed, should be available in a few weeks.
Recommended Terms for Personal Protective Equipment.
This technical
bulletin is now available for distribution.
The booklet was developed to
encourage the use of consistent terminology by those who prepare
guidelines for emergency responders and to define these terms for
emergency response personnel.
One of the motivating reasons for preparing the document was the
ambiguous use of commonly used terms such as "Full Protective Clothing”
and "Special Protective Clothing".
Full Protective Clothing could mean
firefighters' bunker gear/turnout gear or encapsulating chemical suits,
depending on who prepared the guidance material.
"Special Protective
Clothing:
could be encapsulating chemical suits or a "splash suit".
Copies of the bulletin have been sent to CMA members urging them to
use these terms when preparing Material Safety Data Sheets or guidance
information for emergency response personnel.
CHEMTREC Workshops.
A CHEMTREC Emergency Response Team Workshop will
be held in Mobile, Alabama on February 25-26, 1986.
This will be the 30th
workshop to be sponsored by CHEMTREC since the first one was presented in
1978.
Nearly 3,700 people from the chemical, carrier and emergency
response communities have received training for on-scene handling of
chemical emergencies through these workshops.
Communications
The Regional Communications Division is producing a leaflet for the
Chemical Referral Center and an overall booklet for NCRIC.
Regional Communications has approved a matching grant to enable the
Ohio Chemical Council to produce a film on first responder training that
will be specific to Ohio.
Media training was provided for member company representatives who
will participate in upcoming media tours on the National Chemical Response
and Information Center.

FERC Order No. 436 On Interstate Natural Gas Transportation.
On
October 9, 1985, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a
rule on interstate natural gas transportation that adopted many CMA
recommendations.
The rule authorizes self-implementing, nondiscriminatory
interstate transportation services.
Both firm and interruptible services
must be offered by participating interstate pipelines.
Also, reservation
fees for firm services are permitted.
The FERC subsequently modified the rule so that pipelines must permit
distribution company customers to reduce their existing sales demand by up
to 25% per year over five years.
The modified rule (FERC Order 436A) also
permitted certain transportation programs to continue until February 15.
Thus far, most pipelines have been unwilling to transport gas under
the new rules.
The Justice Department is investigating complaints that
pipelines have colluded in refusing to carry gas under those terms.
FERC Proposed Rules on Natural Gas Pricing.
CMA and other industrial
consumers urged the FERC not to implement a proposed block billing
mechanism for interstate pipeline sales.
On December 11, 1985, CMA
testified before the FERC and presented results of an economic impact
study on the proposed block billing rule.
CMA said the cost of the rule
to American industry would be $1.8 billion per year, and the annual cost
to the chemical industry alone would be approximately $600 million.
Both the chemical industry and industry in general, rely
substantially on gas purchased directly from producers.
For example, the
chemical industry purchases 58% of its natural gas from sources other than
conventional pipeline system supply.
The study, done for CMA by Foster
Associates, predicts the proposed pricing rule would raise the price of
gas being purchased directly from producers.
Also, industrial users
buying interstate gas could be allocated higher gas costs.
The FERC proposal also restricts pipeline sales of low-cost gas to
existing customers.
This will increase pressure on both local
distribution companies (LDCs) and end-users to purchase gas directly from
producers, leading to a shift away from conventional pipeline system
supply.
The proposed rule nullifies the potential advantages of increased
competition through the expedited certificate process.
It reduces
pipeline-to-pipeline competition, and encourages bypass of traditional
pipeline system supply sources.
The study also indicates the FERC proposal would increase spot sales,
direct purchases, and traditional pipeline purchases.
It would add
pressure on LDCs and end-users to buy directly from producers since
pipeline competition will be restricted to higher-priced gas.
This will
increase the demand for spot or direct-purchase gas.
Page
33
CMA 038637
In addition, CMA noted that since direct-purchase gas is in
competition with system-supply gas, the marginal cost of system-supply gas
will be higher.
The ceiling on direct-purchase prices will be raised by
as much as 82 cents per million Btu.
Proposed Rules on Old Gas Pricing.
The FERC block billing proposal
fails to deal with the basic problem of continuing price controls that
prevent maximum efficient development and use of the lowest cost "old gas"
resource base, and CMA continues to advocate legislation to deregulate
wellhead ceiling prices, and to remove market restraints.
It appears that
some CMA goals may be achieved through regulatory reform proposals offered
recently by the Department of Energy with the support of the Justice
Department.
On November 18, DOE proposed a rule for final action by the
FERC that makes all old gas eligible for a higher "just and reasonable
price", and that would establish incentive prices for old gas.
On December 20, the FERC issues a schedule for the notice of proposed
rulemaking (Docket RM 86-3).
CMA is preparing written comments that are
due February 25.
A public conference will be announced at a later date.
The FERC is requesting comments on:
legal authority to adopt the
proposal, the inter-relationship with the block billing proposal rule, and
the economic and market impacts of raising old-gas prices.
Taxation
Congressional Developments and Response
President Reagan's last minute intervention provided the margin of
victory as the House passed the Hays and Means tax bill H.R. 3838.
Previously, a majority of 223 Republicans and conservative Democrats had
rejected the Committee's efforts to bring the bill to a vote on the House
Floor.
After the President intervened, the House reversed itself on the
rule of procedure 258 to 168, and passed the bill by voice vote.
Although H.R. 3838 differs significantly from the proposal outlined
by President Reagan on May 28, the bill would nonetheless have a serious
and adverse impact on the chemical industry.
Key features of the
House-passed bill include:

It should be noted that House passage of the tax bill was attained
after President Reagan had furnished a letter to Congressman Kemp (R-NY)
in which he promised to veto "unacceptable" tax legislation that does not
increase the individual personal exemption to $2000, provide for business
capital formation, and assure a tax rate structure no higher than the
Administration's original proposal.
Each would significantly increase the
bill's revenue cost and would require substantial additional offsetting
revenue provisions.
Senator Bob Packwood (R-OR) has indicated that the Senate Finance
Committee will begin its review of H.R. 3838 in early February.
Moreover, Senator Packwood has expressed concern over the ability to find
new revenue sources to'offset proposed Administration changes in the
House-passed bill.
Thus, the prospects are doubtful that the Finance
Committee will develop an early alternative to the House bill before the
July 4th Congressional recess.
CMA strongly opposes the provisions of H.R. 3838 that would
substantially increase business tax costs, particularly of capital
intensive industries and of those that engage in significant international
trade.
A number of leading trade organizations have joined in opposition
to these provisions.
CMA has developed an on-going tax legislative work
plan and is coordinating its activities with allied business groups.
Plant Management and Design (Engineering Codes and Standards)
Regulations, Standards, Codes and Technology
Forum on Safety and Reliability Improvement.
The Inspection and
Engineering Advisory Committee's Maintenance Task Group will meet late
January to make further preparations for the CMA forum on safety and
reliability improvement through application of advanced inspection and
maintenance techniques.
This forum will emphasize those techniques that
directly influence safety of plant and community.
Forum on Process Computers.
The EAC Process Control Task Group met
December 11 to refine the program and arrangements for the Fifth CMA*
Process Computer Users Forum to be held May 5-7, 1986.
This forum will
emphasize safety aspects of control systems design and operation.
Codes.
CMA representatives attended the December 1985 National
Electrical Code panel meetings to discuss and vote on actions taken during

the January 1985 panel meetings.
CMA submitted 114 proposals for revision
of the 1984 code during the fall of 1984, and submitted 68 comments during
the public review period.
The Electrical Codes and Standards Task Group
will meet in Atlanta next May to prepare for floor action on the 1987 code
before its adoption at the NFPA Annaul Meeting.
Safety and costs are the
issues involved.
Standards.
The committee prepared CMA positions on 17 API, IEEE,
NEMA, NFPA, and UL standards proposed for adoption as American National
Standards.
These standards cover storage tanks, test procedures,
electrical equipment in hazardous atmospheres, motors, generators,
insulation, conduit, and controls.
As with codes, safety and costs are
the issues involved.
International Trade/International Competitiveness
Congressional Developments and Response
Omnibus Trade Bill.
The last Congress passed the Trade and Tariff Act
of 1984 in October 1984.
Although this act was the first omnibus trade
bill to be passed in five years, it addressed mostly non-controversial
issues of international trade.
Since the passage of the law, the already
large U.S. foreign trade deficit has swelled to record levels and
probably reached 9140 billion in 1985.
The current Congress is making a
concerted effort to address the nation's growing foreign trade problem and
action on a new piece of omnibus trade legislation can be expected early
in the session.
Senator Danforth (R-MO) introduced the Trade Enhancement Act (S.
The bill contains multiple titles which among other topics, deals
'with foreign targeting, changes to trade remedy laws, the protection of
intellectual property rights and authorization for a new round of
multi-lateral trade negotiations.
CMA already has an approved position on
intellectual property rights and the CMA Board is being asked to address
tariff cutting in the MTN at its January 27-28 meeting.
On the House side, the issue of tax reform prevented the House Ways
and Means Committee from addressing the trade issue during the first
session.
It is expected that trade will be one of its top priority issues
for the second session.
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-8-IL) has already sent
a confidential memorandum to all committee members calling for a retreat
early in 1986 to deal with international trade issues.
Such a retreat
was used last fall by the chairman to get the ways and Means Committee
started on its tax reform package.
The House Energy and Commerce
Committee, chaired by Representative John Dingell (D-16-MI), continues to
push for jurisdiction on trade matters and the committee has already
proposed a limited scope trade package.

trade legislation in both houses as it develops.
Wherever possible this
will be done through the OCITA coalition.
International Negotiations/Agreements
Multi-lateral Trade Negotiation
Last January in his State of the
Union Address, President Reagan called for authority to enter into
discussions leading toward a new round of Multi-lateral Trade Negotiations
A request for such authority is provided in Senator Danforth's
The House will consider the same granting of bargaining authority
early in the year.
The CMA International Trade Committee is recommending
that the Board adopt a position on the MTN at its January 27-28 meeting.
The recommended CMA policy consists of a statement of principles to be
considered by the U.S.
negotiators participating in an MTN.
The proposed
position states that an MTN should focus on the issues of foreign market
access, investment, and dispute settlement procedures for violation of
international trading rules.
Chemical tariff cutting: should be done on a
selective basis with import sensitive products exempted where justified.
Policy Development and Economic Analysis
U.S./Canada Bilateral Free Trade Agreement.
The Trade and Tariff
Act (TTA) of 1984 authorizes the President, upon proper notice to the
Congress, to enter into discussions with other countries which could lead
to a bilateral trade agreement.
Much preliminary work has been done over
the last few years both in the United States and Canada in preparation for
such an agreement.
This includes discussions between CMA's International
Trade Committee and the Canadian Chemical Producers Association Trade
Committee as well as studies by appropriate agencies of both countries'
governments.
On December 10, 1985, President Reagan formally notified the Congress
of his intent to enter into negotiations with the Canadian government.
His action came as a result of a request from the Canadian government for
such negotiations which is one of the requirements stipulated by the TTA.
CMA's membership has been informed of all opportunities for input
into the government's hearings and studies on this issue which have
already been conducted.
Also, the CMA Board has approved a position on a
U.S./Canada agreement which has been well received by officials at the
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce.
Developments will be monitored closely and further action taken as
appropriate.

International Regulatory Issues
(Health, Safety and Environment)
International Organizations
ILO Meeting on Industrial Hazards.
On October 15-21, 1985, the
International Affairs Group (IAG) participated in the International Labour
Organization (ILO) "Tripartite Ad Hoc Meeting of Special Consultants on
Methods of Prevention of Major Hazards in Industry." This meeting was held
in Geneva, Switzerland.
The purpose of the meeting was to develop the necessary steps to
improve safety and health in the production and storage of dangerous
substances and to develop guidelines or an international convention
onmajor industrial hazard control and emergency response systems.
European pressure for international adoption of the "Seveso Directive" on
this subject was deflected by U.S.
and Third World participants.
The
meeting did not result in the compilation or adoption of international
guidelines.
However, continued vigilance is necessary to ensure that ILO
follow-upactions do not unduly restrict the foreign operations of the U.S.
chemical industry.
UNCTC/UNEP Seminar on Industrial Process Safety and Hazards.
After
considerable debate, the IAG decided not to participate in the joint U.N.
Centre on Transnational Corporations (UNCTC) and U.N.
Environment
Programme (UNEP) December, 1985, Seminar on Environmental Management of
Industrial Process Safety and Hazards.
We believed that little progress
would be made at the Seminar because of the wide range of complicated
technical, legal, and policy issues raised in the Agenda and Overview
Papers and the anti-industry biases reflected in these documents.
IAG
also objected to the strictly chemical industry focus of the Seminar and
expressed concern about duplication of efforts with other international
organizations.
IAG will, however, follow the post-Seminar developments at
UNCTC/UNEP for their possible impact on the chemical industry.
Subsequent
to our declining to participate, the U.S.
Government, the International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and the European Council of Chemical
Manufacturers' Federations (CEFIC) also refused to attend.
OECD Developments.
In November, 1985, IAG submitted comments to EPA
and the State Department on new developments in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ChemicalsProgramme and on
papers to be considered at Meetings of the OECD Environment Committee and
Chemicals Group/Management Committee.
IAG also commented on proposed

Meeting), anticipated to be held in late 1986or early 1987.

In addition to the examination of the adequacy of
existing chemicals, the OECD plans to examine the need

Consolidated List of Chemicals.
On December 5, 1985, IAG
submitted comments to the State Department on a June, 1985, Paper of the
Secretariat concerning the compilation of the U.N.
"Consolidated
List of Products Whose Consumption And/Or Sale Have Been Banned,
Withdrawn, Severely Restricted or Not Approved by Governments".
IAG
reaffirmed earlier comments in opposition to this U.N.
activity.
However, underunder the assumption that the U.N.
will continue to compile
its List, IAG also recommended changes in the criteria for listing
chemicals andon provisions to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of
confidentialinformation obtained by the U.N.
in conjunction with its
activity.
Legal Support
EC Product Liability Directive.
With the support of Counsel, IAG is
preparing a proposed position paper on the European Cononunity1s(EC) July,
1985, Product Liability Directive.
This Directive includes several
concepts of concern to international business, including those of
developmental risk, financial limitations on liability, strict liability,
and the definition of a defect.
The member countries of the EC have three years in which to implement
the Directive.
However, the direction of this implementation process is
unclear, since governments have been given various optionsby the Directive
on critical aspects such as financial ceilings and developmental risk,
it
is, therefore, to be expected that differing, inconsistent implementing
laws will be adopted by the EC member countries.
This will inevitably
lead to forum shopping by future plaintiffs.
IAG's comments will be coordinated with those of the International
Chamber of Commerce and the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers'
Federations.

Process Patent Legislation.
On December 16, 1985, CMA sent a letter
to the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights and •
Trademarks expressing support for S.1543, the major legislative vehicle on
process patents.
The Subcommittee had held a hearing on this legislation
on October 23, 1985.
S.1543 would give the owner of a process patented in the United States
the right to bring a suit for patent infringement against a party who
imports a product that is manufactured abroad by using the process.
Many
countries that are major trading partners of the United States already
have such laws.
CMA's comments, however, also urge the Subcommittee to address
ancillary issues before acting on S.1543:
the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) implications of this legislation and circumstances under
which a presumption of infringement should arise when the patent owner is
unable to obtain information about the process used to manufacture a
product.
Earlier in 1985, CMA had joined in a coalition with 73 companies and
12 associations in supporting legislation on this subject generally.
This
coalition is led by Intellectual Property Owners, Inc. (IPO).
The Uniform Patent Procedures Act of 1985.
On November 25, 1985, CMA
endorsed S.64, the Uniform Patent Procedures Act of 1985.
This
legislation, introduced by Senator Dole (R.Kan.) on January 3, 1985,
focuses on government patent policy.
It allows all government contractors
to elect to retain title to federally funded inventions.
It expands
existing law, which applies to contractors from small businesses and
nonprofit organizations, to include large business contractors as well.
CMA believes that S.64 is important to eliminate barriers to
industry's development and application of new technology, and to encourage
a climate under which such development and application will be fostered.
Moreover, prompt passage of S.64 would create an atmosphere in which all
industry, not just selected sectors, would be given the necessary
incentives to make necessary financial investments to move new ideas into
the marketplace.
Policy Development/Legal Issues
Section 301 Investigation on Korea.
In November, 1985, the Office of
the U.S, Trade Representative (USTR) initiated an investigation under
Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, into the adequacy of the
laws of the Republic of Korea governing the protection of intellectual
property rights.
Page

CMA 038645
r
CMA submitted preliminary comments on this subject to USTR.
Additional comments are being compiled, especially on those aspects of the
Korean law that are most troublesome and specific examples of instances in
which U.S. trade and investment have been negatively affected.
State Legislative and Regulatory Advocacy
Superfund
In 1986 additional state superfund action is expected in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Washington, California and South Carolina.
In
New Jersey alone the cost to industry could approach one billion dollars
as Senator Ray Lesniak works to expand the fund.
CMA State Hazardous
Wastes/Groundwater Task Group members are working with the appropriate
state trade organizations on this critical issue.
The Task Group is also completing the first phase of their study of
state superfunds which consisted of a survey of 8 key states:
Alabama,
California, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and South
Carolina.
This initial study will result in a better understanding of the
potential cost to the chemical industry and will also lead to an expanded
study to obtain more comprehensive information.
The study addresses the
broad range of state superfunds, industry funding bases, amounts
collected, actual uses of funds, site selection criteria, cleanup
standards and future plans.
i
Public Compensation
Major state activity on public compensation continues to be in the
state of Massachusetts where the Special Legislative Commission on
Liability for Releases of Oil and Hazardous Materials has been
reactivated.
The coimnission will be studying insurance availability,
quantification of need and liability issues.
The state's public
compensation bill was not acted upon in 1985, but it has been refiled for
1986.
Hazardous Waste Management and Regulation
The National Conference of State Legislatures has identified
environmental issues as one of the top three issues facing the states in
1986.
The other two are education and fiscal concerns.
The major
environmental issues are:
groundwater, acid rain and the disposal of
hazardous waste.
f
The siting of hazardous waste facilities, always a major concern, has
become more complicated by the growing liability insurance problem.
Most
sites cannot be licensed without insurance, which is virtually
unavailable.
Page
42
CMA 038646
Some of the action around the states includes California where the
Governor's task force on toxics, waste, and technology will report its
proposed solutions to the states hazardous waste capacity and policy
problems on May 1.
These recommendations will then be considered by the
legislature as the basis for new laws.
Ohio legislators have approved
sharp increases in waste disposal fees ranging up to S20 per ton.
The
same Ohio bill provides funds to local municipalities for equipment and
training for local emergencies involving hazardous waste.
Right-to-Know
Legislation - Following more than a year of intense debate, the
Michigan Legislature reached a compromise on a package of legislation
which has been endorsed by the Michigan Chemical Council.
The package
consists of three bills:
H.B. 4111 addresses worker right-to-know and
adopts the federal OSHA Hazard Communications Standard with expanded
coverage; H.B. 5250 requires emergency response planning through
information sharing with fire chiefs? H.B. 5251 sets community
right-to-know provisions allowing the general public access to MSDS's and
workplace lists of hazardous substances.
The Legislature adjourned the
1985 session without taking final action on these bills, which will carry
over to 1986.
Consideration is expected early in the year.
In Hew Jersey, the Legislature gave final approval to A. 4145, the
"Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act." This bill requires manufacturers and
users of a limited list of chemicals to register with the state and
perform risk assessments of their chemical processes.
The state has the
authority to order risk reduction measures for covered facilities and
could order operations to cease until risks are reduced to an acceptable
The bill is expected to be signed into law by the Governor in the
near future.
Litigation - on December 12, 1985, the U.S. District Court in
Pennsylvania ruled on the relationship between the state's right-to-know
law and the federal OSHA Hazard Communications Standard.
The ruling
followed the precedent set in New Jersey and held that the Pennsylvania
law is preempted by the standard as it applies to the regulation of
employee health and safety in the manufacturing sector.
The ruling also
held that parts of the law applicable to nonmanufacturers are still
operative, thus creating a dual system in the state.
The chemical
industry may seek clarification on some aspects of the ruling.
The Ohio Manufactures Association has filed suit in Federal Court to
overturn the city of Akron's local right-to-know ordinance on the grounds
of federal preemption.
Arguments and filings in that case are expected to
continue through January.
1986 Legislative Sessions - The State Affairs Right-to-Know Tasi:
Page

CMA 038647
Group is developing a list of issues which may become state legislative
initiatives in 1986,
These include:
collecting data on chemical
production and use in a state; mandatory chemical process controls;
mandatory emergency response planning; and regulation of chemical
shipments through communities.
The task group is reviewing CMA policy in
these areas and preparing position papers and other support materials for
use by member companies and state CIC's who may face these issues during
the year.
Groundwater
As mentioned earlier, the National Conference of State Legislatures
(NCSL) identified groundwater contamination as one of the three top
environmental issues of 1986.
CMA's State Hazardous Waste/Groundwater
Task Group'reports that groundwater will be an issue in virtually every
state.
NCSL and the Council of State Governments are developing position
papers and model legislation, and CMA State Affairs is assisting these key
organizations.
Part of this effort will be shared with a new CMA work
group which combines State Affairs representatives with their counterparts
from the technical committees.
All of this activity is primarily a result
EPA delegating most of the groundwater program to the states
combined with the likelihood of the U.S.
Congress not developing related
legislation until 1988.
So most of the groundwater action for at least
the next couple of years will be at the state level.
Hazardous Materials Transportation
A bill has been recommended to the Colorado Legislature that would
require most trucks carrying hazardous materials to get permits and follow
designated routes.
Money from permit sales and fines imposed on violators
would be used to create a hazardous materials safety fund for training
emergency response crews.
The State Department of Public Safety would
determine the routes that hazardous materials trucks could take and would
issue other rules.
While the majority of the states have passed Good Samaritan laws,
some states will be considering the issue in 1986.
The New Jersey
proposal died near the end of 1985, but the New Jersey Chemical Industry
Council has succeeded in having an identical bill introduced this year.
Additional support is needed to assure passage.
The Ohio House passed a
Good Sam bill on the last day of 1985 and the Senate will consider the
issue early in 1986.
Toxic Air
State Regulation - The Connecticut Department of Health has
challenged a major new air toxics control program that was recently
Page
44
CMA 038648
announced by the state's Department of Environmental Control.
The program
would set ambient limits based on TLV's plus a safety factor for 850
chemicals.
The Department of Health is pushing for changes in the program
to take into account actual health effects of the chemicals.
Until the
agencies are able to reach an agreement, the air toxics program approval
process has been put on hold.
Other states which are considering air
toxics control regulations include Maryland, Kentucky, and North Carolina.
Policy Development - The State Affairs Committee is actively
participating in CMA's effort to develop a new Association program for
reducing toxic chemical emissions.
Once the program has been approved,
the committee will assist other CMA departments in disseminating the
program to state interest groups,
Chronic Health
Legislation establishing a new system for identifying and protecting
workers who are deemed to be at "high" risk of contracting occupational
disease is being considered in California.
A.B. 990 is strongly opposed
by the chemical industry because of its burdensome requirements and high
costs.
The industry feels that existing programs in the state already
accomplish the goals of this bill, and new legislation is unnecessary.
The California CIC, along with CMA member companies, is attempting to
amend or defeat this legislation.
10. Insurance/Liability
Almost all of the state legislative bodies are working on some aspect
of this issue.
The most pressing concern is the affordability and
availability of insurance coverage.
Hearings have been scheduled in many
states.
The more basic concerns of tort reform are also being reviewed.
These concerns will take longer to resolve.
They are being worked on by
the National Council of State Legislatures and the American Legislative
Exchange Council among others.

Butadiene.
The Panel filed comments on the risk assessment for
butadiene prepared by EPA's Carcinogen Assessment Group (CAG).
Panel
representative made a presentation on the CAG risk assessment to EPA's
Science Advisory Board (SAB).
The SAB agreed with many of the Panel's
criticisms of the CAG risk assessment aiid recommended several revisions
along lines suggested by the Panel.
Th$ Panel also filed comments on a
risk assessment prepared by the EPA Office of Toxic Substances (OTS) to
support conclusions about occupational exposure to butadiene.
Panel
representatives subsequently met with John Moore, Assistant Administrator
for Pesticides and Toxic Substances, to discuss the risk assessment.
Moore agreed with many of the Panel's concerns.
The Panel's comments will
be provided to OSHA to assist in preparing a risk assessment for
occupational exposure tb butadiene.
The OTS risk assessment is the basis for EPA* s TSCA Section 9(a)
referral to OSHA.
Panel representatives met with the OSHA staff and JACA
Corporation, OSHA's contractor, to discuss the evaluation of butadiene in
response to EPA's referral.
The Panel will track this activity at OSHA.
The Panel also contracted with an expert consultant to review the
mathematical calculations included in the OTS risk assessment on
butadiene.
The consultant's report identified several flaws in EPA's
approach and recomnended alternative procedures.
The report has been
submitted to EPA.
Panel representatives participated in a CMA workshop on
risk assessment and made presentations on the EPA risk assessment on
butadiene.
The Panel sponsored an audit of the mouse study on butadiene
conducted by the National Toxicology Program.
The Panel's audit
documented the quality control problems experienced during the NTP study
and reinforced the Panel's position that the study is unsuitable for use
in quantitative risk modeling.
Panel representatives also met with NTP
and CUT to review ongoing testing programs for butadiene.
In October 1985, EPA published in the Federal Register an "Intent to
List" Butadiene as a Hazardous Air Pollutant under Section 112 of the
Clean Air Act.
Panel representatives met with the staff of EPA's Office
of Air Quality Planning and Standards to review EPA's evaluation of
butadiene for possible regulation.
The Panel is assisting EPA in trying
to realistically determine the emissions of butadiene.
The Panel activities with EPA and OSHA are expected to continue at a
high level in 1986.

Cumene.
EPA announced proposed testing requirements for cumene under
Section 4 of TSCA in a Federal Register notice on November 6, 1985.
Manufacturers and processors of the chemical will be required to conduct
tests for health and environmental effects.
Health effects testing will include:
pharmacokinetics, developmental
toxicity, subchronic toxicity, neurotoxicity, oncogenicity and
reproductive toxicity (if triggered).
To test for environmental effect,
the Agency is proposing acute and chronic aquatic toxicity tests on
saltwater fish and invertebrates, and biodegradation and volatilization
from water.
The Cumene Panel is preparing comments on the proposal.
Of
particular interest are the findings upon which EPA bases the proposed
rule:
a potentially unreasonable risk of mutagenic and oncogenic effects;
and, a potential for substantial human exposure from manufacturing,
processing, use and disposal.
The Panel wi}.l sponsor further mutagenicity
testing to determine if there is sufficient evidence for the first finding
and also is closely examining emissions data to see if there is
justification for the second,
comments are due to EPA by February 20,

The Panel is expecting the final TSCA Section 4 test rule
this March.
In preparation for the rule, the Panel is receiving bids to
perform the toxicology testing.
A final contractor will be selected and
testing will begin once the final rule is issued.
The Panel is also
tracking the EPA Land Disposal Prohibition Regulation.
Cresols are on
the initial list for possible land disposal banning.
Dibenzofurans/Dibenzodioxins.
The Panel is preparing comments in
response to EPA's TSCA Section 4 and 8 proposed rules.
The proposal
requires the conduct of dioxin and dibenzofgran analyses of various
chemical substances.
The Panel filed comments in response to EPA* s RCRA proposal to change
the listing from "acute hazardous" to "toxi4" for incineration residues of
several dioxin wastes.
The comments argued that EPA should raise the
concentration limit for wastes covered by the rule from 10 ppm to 100 ppm.
Ethylene Dibromide.
The Panel is waiting for a long-overdue OSHA

final rule.
The Panel will review the rule once it is published.
Ethylene Dichloride.
The EPA announced last October an "Intent to
List" EDC as a Hazardous Air Pollutant under Section 112 of the Clean Air
Act.
The Panel provided comments on the announcement and is further
evaluating several of the references given in the announcement.
The Panel
will further review the health effects and risk assessment on EDC provided
in the announcement.
Ethylene Oxide.
The Ethylene Oxide Industry Council provided
comments to EPA on its recent "Intent to List" EO as a Potential Hazardous
Air Pollutant.
The EOIC Environmental Task Group is evaluating the EO air
emissions developed by EPA.
The group is providing EPA with information
to realistically estimate EO releases.
The Task Group has also reviewed
the EPA Human Exposure Model which is used in the Agency's Hazardous Air
Pollutant program.
EPA is presently surveying the industry to determine
episodic releases or excursions from the annual average.
Ethylhexanoic Acid.
The Ethylhexaiioic Acid Panel met with EPA to
discuss the proposed test rule for EHA under Section 4 of TSCA (50 Fed.
Reg.
20678).
EPA has speculated that dermal exposure to EHA might occur
during processing, although manufacturers and major processors have
indicated to the Agency that most operations occur under conditions where
exposure is unlikely.
To bolster its no-exposure argument, the Panel
contracted with Temple, Barker and Sloane, Inc.
to conduct a survey of
handling practices among processors of EHA.
The survey responses
indicated that dermal contact with EHA during processing is virtually
non-existent.
Ninety percent of the responders instruct their employees
to wear gloves when they may have contact with EHA, and five percent
distribute EHA without repackaging.
Given these results, the Panel feels
that EPA cannot justify a finding that exposure to EHA in the workplace
"may present an unreasonable risk of injury."
The Panel will continue to work with EPA to document the position
that a No-Test Decision should be made for EHA.
EPA is expected to
publish its conclusion in the Summer of 1986.
Fluorocarbons.
In October 1985 the Fluorocarbon Panel released its
report on the production, use, and emissions of chlorofluorocarbons 11 and
12 through 1984.
Production of CFC-11 increased from 1,427 million pounds
in 1983 to 1,531 million pounds in 1984, according to the Alexander Grant
and Company compilation.
Members of the Panel met in early October with Department of State
and Environmental Protection Agency officials to review upcoming
activities under the United Nations Environment Programme's (UNEP)
Committee for the Protection of Stratospheric Ozone.
Two economic
workshops are being planned for 1986, as well as an EPA/UNEP conference
Page
48
CMA 038652
entitled, "Health and Environmental Effects of Ozone Depletion and Climate
Change."
The Panel submitted comments to EPA on the August 1985 draft of the
Rand Corporation report on "Projected Use, Emissions, and Banks of
Potential Ozone-Depleting Substances" (October 16, 1985).
Retirements and reassignments marked the closing months of 1985.
In
September, long-time Panel member B.
Peter Block of Pennwalt retired.
He
has been replaced both on the Panel and as Chairman of the External
Affairs Task Force by Julius Dohany, Director of Fluorochemicals Research
and Development for Pennwalt.
Hillel Magid of Allied-Signal and Odo Klais
of Hoechst Ag were both reassigned to new duties within their companies in
December.
No plans to replace them have been announced.
Also in
December, Richard B.
ward, representative from E.I.
du Pont and Chairman
of the Panel, was transferred to a new position at DuPont.
Mack McFarland
will replace him as the DuPont representative.
The Panel is facing the
election of a new chairman.
Glycol Ethers.
At an October public course-setting meeting, EPA
announced its intent to require testing of three triethylene glycol
monoethers (TGE) — methyl, ethyl and butyl.
EPA is proceeding with a
single-phase rulemaking.

ANNUAL COMMITTEE REPORTS
Mr. Clark Indicated the chairmen making their annual reports on the
activities and outlook of the various Association committees had been asked to
change the format of their presentations to be shorter and less technical, and more
focused on one or two key issues in the year ahead. He expressed his hope that
this would lead to more dialogue between the committee chairmen and the Board, and
less formal presentations.
DISTRIBUTION COMMITTEE
Mr. Jacobson presented the annual report of the Distribution Committee.
A summary of his report is attached as Exhibit A. Highlights from 1986 in his
report included:
Increase in CHEMTREC activity,
Miamlsburg incident and CMA documentary,
First responder training program and materials.
Development of CMA training videotapes.

Risk management in transportation
International regulation
CMA 038703
CHEMNET REPORT
Mr. Jacobson provided an update (Exhibit B) on the CHEMNET program and
the need to expand participation in the program beyond the 79 companies currently
participating. He indicated that the CHEMNET system had been triggered 41 times in
the past 14 months and those incidents all appeared to be well handled. Although
liability had been a major concern inhibiting the participation of some companies,
the first year's experience did not result in any litigation against a CHEMNET
responder.
Following Mr. Jacobson's presentation, there was general discussion of
the program and the need for more participation. It was agreed that there should
be another solicitation to non-participating companies, indicating the overall
success of the program to date and the endorsement of the Association’s Board for
increased participation.
TEXAS CHEMICAL COUNCIL
Mr. Seay, Chairman of the Texas Chemical Council (TCC), presented an
overview of the TCC; the importance of the chemical industry to the Texas economy;
the importance of Texas' chemical industry to the overall strength nationwide of
the chemical industry; the development of an innovative grassroots program — the
Associated Chemical Industry of Texas (ACIT).
Mr. Vhltworth, President of the TCC, presented a business climate/
legislative outlook for Texas in 1987. Key Issues for the industry in Texas this
year were identified as budget and taxes, tort reform, and cogeneration. General
discussion of Texas Issues and TCC and ACIT activities followed, A copy of the TCC
report is attached as Exhibit C.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded, it was
VOTED: That the following recommendations of the Texas
Chemical Council be endorsed by the Board:
That CMA and its individual member companies provide
support for °
Plant managers in their work with government
relations, public affairs, CAER, etc.
Increased company, supplier and customer support
for the Texas Civil Justice League (tort reform
coalition) and the Associated Chemical Industry
of Texas (a coalition of business in support of
chemical Industry Interests).

2354
HEALTH AND SAFETY COMMITTEE
Mr. Condray presented the annual report of the Health and Safety Commit­
tee. A summary of his report is attached as Exhibit D. He highlighted key activ­
ities from 1986 such as Superfund (emergency preparedness, community right-to-know,
health authorities, etc.), CAER, OSHA and the BLS guidelines. He indicated a major
priority for the next 5-10 years will be worker health and safety issues such as
the adequacy of workplace regulations, inspection mechanisms, chronic disease
detection and compensation mechanisms.
Following Mr. Condray's presentation, there was general discussion of
these Issues with particular attention to OSHA and the enforcement of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS) guidelines for reporting injuries. It was agreed that the
need for all member companies to utilize the BLS guidelines was still critical and
that another communication to the membership on this matter was appropriate. The
advisability of an officer-level visit with the Labor Department/OSHA leadership
was also discussed.
AIR TOXICS SURVEY
Mr. Berryman presented an overview of the Environmental Management
Committee's progress on implementing the Association's air toxics policy.
Mr. Ring presented the interim results (Exhibit E) of the survey on the
status of implementation by the membership of the air policy. His report is
attached as Exhibit E. Through January 9, 71 responses had been received and
follow-up was continuing with the other 100 members. Major needs identified in the
survey were a better understanding of the program and its objectives within the
Industry, and additional support for member companies in the area of communications
with the plant community and the public generally. Smaller companies requested a
prioritization of recommended activities and some sense of what a recommended
company program should be. Mr. King's conclusion from the survey and the ongoing
analysis of the EMC group was that substantial progress had been made but that it
was'not yet sufficient to meet the programs objectives.
Following Mr. King's presentation, there was general discussion regarding
the survey and the overall implementation of the policy.Those Board members
who
had not yet responded to the survey were urged to do so. The importance of a good
response from the membership on the policy's implementation was also stressed. It
was suggested that the responses be portrayed as representing a percentage of the
total sales of the Industry, and staff agreed to explore this approach.
There was
Committee and Board
programs for Issues
agreed to take this
also considerable discussion of the need for the Executive
to discuss and come to agreement on long-range directions and
such as health effects and other strategic areas. The officers
under advisement.
SPECIAL ENERGY ADVISORY GROUP
Mr. Irvine presented the report of the Special Energy Advisory Group. A
summary of his report is attached as Exhibit F. He highlighted key developments
[since the group was formed in the Spring of 1986. He indicated that energy costs
the chemical Industry about $12 billion per year and represents approximately 27X
of product cost. Key Issues in 1986 Included reporting requirements. Federal
CMA 038705
2355
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) action, oil import fee proposals and the
Superfund petroleum tax. For 1987, Mr. Irvine projected oil import fees and FEF.C
actions as the major issues.
SPECIAL PROGRAMS POLICY COMMITTEE
Mr. Corless presented the annual report of the Special Programs Policy
Committee. A summary of this report is attached as Exhibit G. He reported that it
had been a quiet year with no major policy Issues to resolve. He did, however,
raise one Important issue for Board consideration.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded, it was
VOTED: That Executive Contacts of member
companies be encouraged to place their joint
efforts on individual products (Special
Programs) under the aegis of a trade association.
The importance of the trade association umbrella for both Individual
companies and the industry as a whole was stressed. It was agreed that a letter to
Executive Contacts should be sent reinforcing this point.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMITTEE
Mr. Tumlpseed presented the annual report of the International Trade
Committee. A summary of his report is included as Exhibit H. Key Issues addressed
in 1986 were the pending trade legislation and the MTN under GATT, both of which
will carry over into 1987. In addition, the US-Canada free trade negotiations are
also expected to move ahead rapidly this year. He indicated that more companies
should get Involved in CMA's trade activities, because the Association needs their
input on key Issues and because the Association can substantially assist member
companies with their specific trade problems.
REGIONAL EXECUTIVE CONTACT MEETINGS
Chairman Clark made a preliminary report on the six regional Executive
Contact meetings hosted by CMA's officers during December and January in the
following cities: Columbus, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York (2) and Houston. He
indicated that the meeting scheduled for Atlanta on January 22 was snowed out and
would be rescheduled for April. The San Francisco meeting will tentatively be
rescheduled for late August in conjunction with the meeting of the Board in
California. Seventy-five senior Industry executives participated, together with
nineteen representatives from 14 state chemical councils.

Mr. Train, chairman of CSI, presented a comprehensive report on the status
of Clean Sites Inc. and the outlook for its continued viability and utility in the
year ahead. He identified problems which had Initially slowed or Inhibited CSI
involvement and he highlighted a number of major successes. He indicated the
evolution that CSI was undergoing as a result of the recently enacted Superfund
amendments.
Mr. Train concluded by presenting an overview of the financial status and
needs of CSI over the next three years. To meet those needs, he requested continu­
ing financial support from the chemical industry during that period on a reduced
basis from that provided during the initial three years.

bills to be considered by the Congress in 1987. Although this has not been a
critical issue for the chemical industry to date, he indicated that there is the
likelihood for increased use of this Section of the law in the future (potentially
with respect to oil and oil derivatives) and the approved position would be a
useful tool for coalitioning purposes.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded, it was
VOTED: That the proposed international trade
national security Issues policy as set forth
in Exhibit P be approved.
ANSI LABELING STANDARDS
Mr. Condray presented a proposal to endorse the submission of the revised
labeling standard (ANSI Z129,1-1987) for consensus adoption. He indicated the CMA
had been involved in developing voluntary labeling guidelines since 1946 and that
since 1976, CMA has served as the secretariat organization for the ANSI labeling
standard. The most significant new aspect of the revised standard is the inclusion
of labeling for delayed (chronic) hazard and target organ/system hazards.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded, it was
VOTED: That the proposed ANSI submission,
as described in Exhibit Q, be approved.

OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE NOTIFICATION AND PREVENTION
Hr. Condray presented a raport and recommendations for acCion regarding
pending occupaclonal disease notification and prevention legislation introduced by
Senator Metzenbaum and Congressman Gaydos. Although legislation had been proposed
by these two members in the last Congress, Mr, Condray reported they had very
recently reintroduced legislation which contained substantial modifications and
that our analysis of these proposals was still under way. Ha indicated that both
bills reflect the agenda of organized labor and are designed to generate litigation
based on workplace exposures.
In developing the Association's position on this issue and on the partic­
ular bills already Introduced, Mr. Condray proposed that four criteria be followed:
Base the response on credible science, have it conform as nearly as possible to the
proactive practices of CMA's member companies, make it politically viable, and
minimize its Impact on liability and compensation.
The action of the Executive Committee on this Issue the previous day was
reviewed. The Executive Committee had approved the criteria listed above, but
requested that the Health and Safety Committee and the Government Relations Commit­
tee do additional work on the specific legislative alternatives. If policy
approval were required prior to the March Executive Committee meeting, the Execu­
tive Committee recommended that the officers be authorized to provide that policy
oversight.
Considerable discussion followed on the specific provisions In the
egislation and the proposals which had been Included in the meeting materials. Of
articular note was the discussion on whose responsibility it would be to notify
impacted employees — the employer's or the government's. It was the consensus of
the Board that the final legislative principles being drafted by the group should
not be drawn so as to create the impression that CMA was advocating removing all
responsibility for worker notification from the employer. Employers should main­
tain, at a minimum, the right to provide the notification, even if the government
ultimately would be Involved as well. There was also discussion regarding the
delicate nature of CMA's participation in the broad-based business coalition on
this issue, and the necessity for CMA to maintain maximum flexibility for itself as
the legislative debate evolved.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded, it was
VOTED:
That the four criteria for developing the
Association's position on worker notification
legislation, as set forth above, be endorsed
and that the Health and Safety Committee and
Government Relations Committee further pursue
the development of specific legislative
alternatives.
That the officers be authorized to provide
policy oversight if approval of those
alternatives is required prior to the March
Executive Committee meeting.

CLEAN SITES INC,
FUNDING
Following up on Mr. Train's presentation the previous day, Mr. McBrayer
presented a proposal for continued member company voluntary support of Clean Sices.
This proposal had been endorsed the previous day by the Executive Committee. There
was considerable discussion of the proposal, CSI's substantive and financial
performance in its first three years, and various other approaches for CSX to
address its budget and financial needs.
ON MOTION, duly made and seconded, it was
VOTED, (with one abstention) That the following Board
resolution be adopted:
Association members are urged to contribute to CSI for
fiscal year 1987/88 according to a reduced "fair share"
schedule listed below. Continued contributions by member
companies to CSI are endorsed by CMA with the understand­
ing that the total of CMA member company contributions
will be matched by contributions from other sources. It
was also understood that if Clean Sites continues to
develop as planned, the organization will again request
financial support from CMA member companies in fiscal
1988/89 and 1989/90, but at a reduced rate designed to
yield $1.1 million and $.7 million, respectively, com­
pared with the $1.6 million sought for fiscal 1987/88.
These second and third year requests will be reviewed by
the Executive Committee and Board in each year and would
be evaluated at that time based on their merits.

REPORT OF
DISTRIBUTION COMMITTEE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Two primary issues hava surfaced during 1986 relative to the
distribution of chemicals that demand a great deal of attention by the
Distribution Committee. These are chemical transportation risk
management and non-tariff trade barriers affecting the international
distribution of chemicals.
It has become readily apparent that the chemical manufacturing
eoonunity must take a more proactive role in identifying and
compensating for the many variables that influence the safe
transportation of chemicals. State and local officials,
environmentalists, and congressional oversight committees are among the
many groups that have expressed concern over the potential risks
associated with chemical transportation. The Distribution Committee
has Joined forces with representatives from the railroad and trucking
industries to assess the risks of moving different types of chemicals.
During tha upcoming year risk management models will be developed that
individual chemical companies can use to work with their carriers in
identifying the safest possible means of transporting their products.
The past year has also brought on a great deal of activity in the
international regulatory arena which has had a significant impact on
the distribution of chemicals. The Distribution Committee has been
instrumental in tha development of marine pollution requirements that
guard against the dumping of chemical wastes at sea. Fortunately,
because of the Distribution Committee's efforts the international
requirements did not go so far as to curtail international chemical
transportation, or make it so expensive for U.S. shippers that they
would be put at a competitive disadvantage with foreign chemical
companies.
CMA also played a major role in getting U. S. government officials
to intervene in the efforts of foreign governments to reserve cargo to
their nations flag vessels, thus reducing competition and creating a
serious impediment to the safe transportation of chemicals.
The National Chemical Response and Information Center (NCRIC) has
gone beyond the industry's expectations in fulfilling the needs of
emergency responders and the public for chemical related information.
CHEMTREC, which celebrated its fifteenth anniversary, has seen a
significant growth in activities over 1986. Calls rose from 34,000
inquiries in 1985 to 41,000 in 1986, a 231 increase. CHEMTREC also
introduced the Hazard Information Transmission System which enables
emergency responders to access hard copy chemical information via a
computer link. The CHEMNET program, the industry's first all
encompassing mutual aid network, has continued to grow in size and
importance over the past year.
It was recognized by Secretary of
Transportation Elizabeth Dole during the 1986 Spills Conference as a
major industry initiative to assist emergency responders in effectively
handling chemical transportation accidents.
The NCRIC Landing Library has also been tremendously successful.
Over 123,000 emergency responders have had the opportunity to view the •
videos. The chemical industry has received countless praise for this
major effort to train emergency responders on the proper techniques for
handling chemical emergencies.
The Chemical Referral Center responded to over 11,000 inquiries
from the public for non-emergency health and safety information about
chemicals. An index of approximately 110,000 products has been
developed to assist the Chemical Referral Center in quickly identifying
the appropriate companies to refer callers to. This service is
expected to continue to increase in importance over the coming year as
states and local communities implement the right-to-know provisions of
the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act.
While a great deal of the Distribution Committee's energies were
directed at improving the safe transportation of chemicals during 1986,
the Committee continued to promote competition and cost-effective
measures for the distribution of chemicals. The Committee was
successful in getting the Interstate Commerce Commission to overrule
the efforts of a major railfoad to flag out of its common carrier
responsibilities to move certain chemicals. The Committee also played
a key role in helping to shape practical rules for railroad cost
recovery practices. CMA also intervened in a case before the ICC in an
effort to establish a favorable precedent for competitive access
remedies for shippers captive to a single railroad.
The reauthorization of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act
did not occur during 1986 but it is expected to receive considerable
attention in 1987. The Distribution Committee took advantage of this
time to promote the CMA position adopted at last January's Board
meeting. CMA will continue to take a lead role in the development of
reasonable legislation governing the transportation of chemicals.

Report of the
Texas Chemical Council
Objective
Review the status of key issues and present recommendations to improve
overall effectiveness of the chemical industry in Texas.
Background
o
Texas Chemical Council (TCC) has a membership of 84 companies and has
effectively represented chemical industry Interests in Texas for more
than 34 years.
Texas is important to the chemical industry, and the chemical
industry is important to Texas
o
o
Texas leads the chemical industry in value of chemical shipments.
Our industry in Texas is the largest in value added and results in
the employment of 370,000 Texans.
TCC is
nical,
member
though
effective because of the highly competent management, tech­
communications and government relations talent provided by
companies working closely with a respected, exceptionally able
small staff.
Committees are active in safety, health, CAER, environmental
conservation (air, water and solid waste), taxes, energy and
public affairs.
High credibility has allowed TCC to play a prominent role in
influencing legislation and regulations in areas such as Right-toKnow, hazardous waste management, permits and air toxics.
We are unique in our successful development of a broad based grass­
roots support organization consisting of suppliers and service firms
along with manufacturers that are TCC members.
ACIT, the Association of Chemical Industry of Texas, now four
years old with almost 300 member companies, was formed with the
specific objectives of defending the chemical industry and helping
it prosper.
During the Superfund debate ACIT members effectively communicated
chemical industry positions with the Texas delegation, demonstra­
ting its potential for influencing the political process and
impacting public opinion.
CMA 038720
2
o
The business climate in Texas continues to be favorable but is
threatened by the deficit induced search for new taxes.
o
As a result of competitive pressures, Texas chemical industry
employment has declined 20* since 1980.
We have been able to successfully use the jobs issue thus far to
counter the thrust toward higher taxes.
It has been necessary to raise TCC dues (based on employee roll
count) to maintain program effectiveness during period of
declining employment.
Goals for 1987
A. Push for state budgetary restraint with minimum need for new taxes
and equitable basis for those that occur.
Without a tax increase Texas faces a biennium budget deficit of
four to five billion dollars out of a total budget of around 37
billion dollars.
Governor Clements is expected to push for budget cuts consistent
with campaign pledge; Legislature reluctant to make deep cuts
despite fact that increases over last decade are far in excess of
inflation and population growth.
Chemical industry represents a convenient target for new taxes
with several proposals aimed at broadening the sales tax base to
include energy, manufacturing materials, contract labor and
intrastate freight.
Texas Comptroller’s proposal would raise chemical industry taxes
by 210 million dollars per year, which represents a 200* increase
in state taxes.
Lobbying effort has been effectively supported by TCC member
company surveys and publications which dramatize the disastrous
effect such actions would have on our industry, employment and the
state's economy.
In addition to strong grassroots lobbying we are working to
strengthen coalitions among other trade associations, encouraging
the Legislature to free up dedicated funds and seeking to hold the
line on agency budgets and fees.
CMA 038721
B. Gain passage of meaningful tort reform legislation.
Texas Civil Justice League (TCJL) was established with TCC as a
founding member and continuing force to help bring about reform in
state tort laws.
There are over 400 TCJL members including cities, railroads,
engineers, newspapers, chemical companies, hospitals, school
districts, builders, and many other businesses and professions.
Legislative objectives include: (1) initiation of comparative
responsibility in cases of joint and several liability; (2)
limitations on non-economic and punitive damages and disposition
of awards; (3) limitations on lawyer contingency fees; (4) pro­
hibitions against venue shopping; (5) allowance of collateral
source offset and use of periodic payments in lieu of lump sum
awards; (6) exclusion of pre-judgment interest; (7) limitations on
liability of officers and directors of non-profit organizations;
and (8) reduced statute of limitations for minors.
Accomplishing such reforms will be no small task, since passage in
the state senate requires a two-thirds majority vote, and there is
formidable opposition to tort reform by the Texas Trial Lawyers.
Developing grassroots support is critically important to success
and consists of efforts to educate employees and public, formation
of local steering committees, recruiting new TCJL members and
targeting various legislators reluctant to accept tort reforms.
Even with legislative success continuing effort must be made to
elect responsible judges who will honor mandate and preserve
reforms.
C. Gain passage of legislation supporting use of industry cogenerated
power
TCC has fostered formation of a broad based advocacy group called
LECT (Lower Electrical Costs for Texans) to discourage
construction of unnecessary high cost power plants and facilitate
wheeling of lower cost cogenerated power to other areas of state
in need of electricity.
Selling points are lower electrical rates achieved through more
efficient use of energy and avoided construction costs and
preservation of jobs by keeping the manufacturing sector
competitive.
CWA 038722
Utility companies are strongly opposed to any change that affects
their monopolistic control and ability to generate income from new
investments and receive favorable rate base treatment on very
expensive nuclear power plant construction nearing completion.
Willing to discuss issues with utility companies in an effort to
reach reasonable agreement; negotiated or legislative success will
be difficult to achieve and is largely dependent on industry's
resolve to persevere.
D. Other Key objectives
Have Texas emergency response commission appointed on a basis
consistent with CAER utilizing existing working relationship.
Limit control of air toxics to regulations that rely primarily
on responsible self management by industry.
Support implementation of CMA air toxics program and continued
progress of CAER including expansion into transportation area.
Hold chemical risk communication seminar/workshop with media,
agencies, environmentalists and public interest groups as co­
sponsors.
Achieve reasonable State Implementation Plan for ozone attainment
and avoid costly renewable permit provision to be considered by
Legislature.
Satisfactorily settle Sierra Club suit over Texas water quality
standards which TCC is involved in as an intervenor.
Be prepared to deal with possible legislation and further
regulation on groundwater protection and hazardous materials
transportation.
Gain recognition of need for more reasonable agency enforcement
policies.
Assist member companies in complying with new OSHA/BLS
injury/illness recordkeeping guidelines and continue to spearhead
industry efforts to fight drug abuse.
CMA 038723
Recommendations to Improve Chemical Industry Support in Texas
o
Support plant managers in their government relations and public affairs
activities.
Stay in touch with issues.
Acknowledge the importance of Plant Manager's role in state and
public affairs.
Make top executives available to discuss key issues with state
officials.
Provide adequate technical resourcing so that we can maintain
industry credibility and continue to favorably impact
legislation/regulation.
o
Join ACIT and TCJL if not presently involved and encourage local
management to recruit suppliers and customers; consciously evaluate
your company's interest in LECT and act accordingly.
o
Provide increased PAC funds to support election of qualified
conservative, business oriented candidates.
o
Consider making contributions to TCC's PAC - FREEPAC or at least
work with TCC in coordinating effective use of industry wide
funds.
Assist state CIC's in defining industry economic impact of
environmental issues with emphasis on jobs and competitiveness.
Actions Required
Board endorsement of the thrust of these recommendations.

REPORT OF
health and safety committee
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Health and Safety Committee (H5C) developed effective
legislative, regulatory and member services progress that verc highly
successful during 1986. In vorking with other parts of CMA's
organization, the Committee was able to achieve significant improvement
in proposed federal legislation and regulations. It vas also
successful in promoting voluntary Initiatives that enhanced CMA's and
the chemical industry's image among the public.
On the legislative front, the Committee vas able to improve the
health provisions contained in the nev Superfund lav by putting forvard
alternatives better suited to meet the intent of Congress. These
included the community right-to-know, emergency preparedness and
health-related authorities provisions. In general, these conform to
CMA's adopted policies and, in many eases, existing company practices.
Significantly, we made convincing arguments against proposed public
compensation provisions. The Comittee also put forvard defensible
policies on worker notification legislation proposed by Congress and
the State of California, precluding nev legislation.
The Committee responded to proposed regulations under several
health, safety and environmental lavs. Under EPA's TSCA program, for
example, the Committee filed comments on proposed test guidelines,
inventory update, regulation of intermediates, comprehensive assessment
information and EPA penalty policies. Under OSHA, CMA commented on
hazard cotmnunicatlon training standards, laboratory substances
protection and process safety reviev, among others.
This past year, the Committee sought opportunities to Initiate
programs to benefit CMA's members. CAER, for example, made significant
strides to cement the program throughout our Industry and many other
chemical user industries. We worked to ensure thac EPA and state
agencies and organizations recognized and endorsed CAER as the
principal alternative for chemical Industry emergency preparedness. In
addition to overseeing the CAER program, BSC worked closely with OSHA
and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to adopt uniform guidelines for
reporting occupational injuries and illnesses. The Committee's efforts
proved largely successful in dealing with OSHA's nev citation and
penalty policy.
In 1986, the Committee also held numerous workshops to keep CMA
members Informed on important health and safety Issues. A quarterly
newsletter was started to supplement specific communications to CMA's
membership.
For 1987, a strong emphasis on health and compensation programs
will be the focus of the Health and Safety Committee's activities. To
manage the many health Issues facing our industry, the Committee will
need strong member company support and involvement of company health
professionals in its programs.
CMA 038725
1
XI. PROGRAM OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK
This report marks the second year chac Che Health and Safety
Committee has reported to CMA's Board of Directors since January 1985,
when the Board consolidated two standing committees and two special
Executive Committee task groups into this standing committee.
Considerable effort was made in last year's report to describe the
functional matrix adopted by HSC organization chat was put in place to
handle the diverse kinds of health, safety and compensation issues chac
confront the chemical Industry today. The issues we saw this past year
tested the organization, and our positive results indicate that It
functioned well.
In 1986. the Health and Safety Committee was faced with
significant legislative threats contained In the federal Superfund and
worker notification bills. Both proposed requirements that would
dramatically change the future course of chemical companies' health,
safety and compensation programs. The Superfund bills drafted In early
1986 would have required specific process safety systems In chemical
plants, extensive reporting of chemical mass balance Information, and
broad expensive health programs for people with little or no
significant exposure. In addition, a federal compensation system with
changes to state tort lavs was proposed. It would have greatly
expanded companies' liability potential.
The Superfund amendments signed into lav reflect marked
improvements, in part due to CMA's substituting a more sound
alternative. This approach typifies the committee's method of
advocating chemical company positions before Congress and elsewhere.
The Title III requirements that ultimately passed has narrower
reporting requirements, builds on the OSHA Hazard Communication
Standard, and embodies CMA's Community Awareness and Emergency Response
(CAER) program. It leaves existing tort lav intact, does not provide
for a new administrative compensation program, and creates a
health-based assessment program consistent with sound chemical Industry
practices used today. All in all, the results of the committee's
priority attention and its approach to these portions of Superfund
reauthorization yielded significant benefits results to our Industry.
Legislation to classify workers in high health-risk groups was
successfully postponed during 1986. The Gaydos and Metzenbaum worker
notification bills were not taken up by the 99th Congress for final
consideration. The Health and Safety Conmlttee articulated flaws In
the bills' approaches and Impacts on workplace health programs, and
argued for expanding existing requirements of OSHA's Hazard
Communication Standard instead.
Success In postponing these two legislative initiatives resulted
from strong teamwork among the Committee’s task groups, but equally
important, among the members of other departments and committees.
Close coordination with Government Relations, Legal and Communications
Department staffs and company representatives was essential in the
success of our program alternatives in the legislative debate.
CMA 038726
1
2
While the Committee gave legislative Initiatives a high priority
in 1986, it devoted most of Its effort to responding to government
regulatory programs. Here too, the Health and Safety Committee
employed a strategy of recommending better alternatives to proposed
regulations to Improve the final outcomes. With the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, for example, the Conaittee worked
closely with the agency to develop better occupational injury and
illness reporting guidelines. It was also able to work with OSHA to
improve its records inspection program and citation policy through a
collaborative CMA/OSHA educational program on recordkeeping for CMA
members. By working with the agency to identify its program needs and
concerns and advocating our members* Interest, the Couittee was able to
defuse the troubling OSHA policy on recordkeeping finss that began with
the unprecedented $1.3 million fine at Institute, West Virginia.
At E?A, the CooiBlctee focused on the agency's unbending conviction
that chemical substances, in general, have insufficient toxicological
testing to evaluate their risk to health and the environment. The
Agency also believed that the regulatory process under the Toxic
Substances Control Act (TSCA) was too blow and cumbersome to address
adequately the problem. Environmental Interest groups concurred with
E?A. In evaluating this situation, HSC looked at how it might resolve
basic concerns about the TSCA program without unfavorable Congressional
changes to the law. It concluded that participating in an informal
dialogue group with all interested parties could successfully lower the
concern. The approach worked, resulting in consensus agreements on
negotiated testing and follow-up reporting for new"chemicals. In
addition, the process of informal discussion allowed traditional
chemical industry antagonists to gain a better understanding of our
concerns and needs. It has opened communication channels further with
the environmental Interest groups and EPA staff. Informal dialogue
with traditional opposing parties remains an Important Committee
advocacy tool.
While the Conaittee sought to gain understanding from Interest
groups and agency staff, it spent considerable effort in communicating
to CMA members. It initiated a.quarterly newsletter on health and
safety Issues, which has quickly become "must” reading for corporate
regulatory affairs managers. Periodic informational meetings,
including a program at the annual Chemical Industry Conference, are
also supported strongly by BSC. In addition, the Committee
significantly increased the number of workshops, seminars and
roundtables that it sponsored. Topics included CAER Implementation,
process safety analysis, and drug control programs for the workplace.
About a dozen such meetings gave CMA members invaluable information
about governmental programs, member company practices, methods for
protecting workers and the conanmlty, and operating facilities safely.
Meeting program needs of other parts of CMA's organization has
also been a Committee priority. Close ties with the Distribution and
Environmental Management Consittees, for example, is essential for
maintaining consistency in our health and safety policies for the
industry. Many of the challenges facing these committees are driven by
the public's concern about health effects from exposure to substances
chat we transport or release into the environment. HSC believes it is
essential that we avoid Inconsistency in our health policy that could
CMA 038727
3
undermine CMA's credibility and effectiveness as the chief chemical
Industry trade association. It. therefore, is diligent in
collaborating closely with its CMA counterparts and ensuring that
positions on both federal and state regulatory initiatives are
consistent. Coordination with CMA's state affairs program is monitored
routinely as a result.
A survey of last year's Committee activities and programs and a
look at what lies ahead indicates the Health and Safety Comittee will
likely direct a majority of its efforts at addressing health concerns.
To help answer comunity concerns, the Comittee will place high
priority on the CAER program. The program has become even more
important to the chemical industry with Superfund reauthorization,
since emergency preparedness programs in consunltles are now required
by lav. CAER serves as a vehicle for community compliance with the new
Title III (emergency response) requirements. It also has created a
useful communications network for companies' response to ocher local
concerns, such as health impacts of environmental releases. The CAER
network, therefore, will play an important role in implementing CMA's
Air Toxics Control Program at the local level during 1987.
Health concerns about employees', exposure to chemicals in the
workplace has already surfaced as a key issue for the coming year. Two
bills introduced the first day of the new 100th Congress will sharpen
the Congress' oversight on worker notification and medical
surveillance, and could result in new legislation to address workplace
health concerns. The comittee will, as a result, spend significant
effort in developing and recomending legislative policy on
occupational disease assessment control, and compensation. It will
also look for opportunities to recomend the initiation of appropriate
worker health programs that could serve as models for members of the
chemical industry, or that regulatory agencies have envisioned for the
future. Health concerns will likely be the focus of the debate in TSCA
reauthorization this year as well, which will also require HSC's
priority attention.
As has been the case traditionally, the bulk of HSC's resources
will be directed toward regulatory response. New authority provided to
EPA and to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
in the reauthorized Superfund law will greatly expand the Comittee's
workload. Much work will be needed to ensure that Implementing
regulations are reasonable, effective, and not excessively costly.
Commencing on regulations under TSCA and OHSA Is likely to represent
the remaining bulk of the comittee's regulatory activities. Both
agencies have Indicated their intent to step up the pace of their
regulatory programs.
The Comittee is confident that it is organized well to meet the
challenges facing it in 1987. As with most organizations, resources
will play an important role in whether it can successfully carry out
its programs. Especially critical to the Comittee's success is active
participation of company experts, particularly vlth health science and
health policy expertise. The recent new legislation, plus continued
expansion of existing agency programs, will require, more than ever
before, added CMA member company support for involving its health
professionals in the Health and Safety Comittee's programs.

commitment by CMA member companies to operate facilities in a
safe and responsible manner.
Since the policy was adopted, the Association has taken
significant steps to assist members in their implementation of
the policy and to prepare for legislative advocacy on the issue.
At its September 1986 meeting, the CMA Board of Directors
approved a survey of the membership to evaluate where we stand
on the implementation of the policy, identify additional needs
of members and prepare for the 1987-88 legislative debates.
Survey
The survey document was sent on October 31, 1986 by Mr. Roland
to the members' executive contacts asking that the information
be returned by November 26, 1986.
responses have been received with approximately 100 members not
responding.
Individual contacts were made with those firms not
responding, and a second letter from Mr. Roland is scheduled to
be mailed early this month requesting a prompt response.
The preliminary results of the survey indicate that
o
Most responders have a program that tracks the CMA
policy and most of those programs existed before the
policy was adopted.
The programs have been
strengthened since the policy was adopted.
o
The programs of most responders currently are in place
or are underway for all facilities which, in the
aggregate, represent over 850 facilities in all states
except North and South Dakota.
Sixteen states have 20
or more facilities representing 95% of the total.
o
Almost all respondents use modeling or engineering
techniques to conduct impact assessments. Very few
conduct actual measurements.
o
Most respondents indicated that a variety of
activities are underway to reduce emissions with most
of these activities being strengthened as opposed to
initiated in the last two years.
CMA 038729

o
There is a strong correlation of the accidental
release activities under the policy to the CAER
program.
o
Communications with outside groups are evident in the
accidental release area with less or no communication
to date for process emissions.
o
Most company programs do not address transportation
activities.
o
The evaluation of CMA performance in implementing the
policy is rated by the respondents at 3 to 4 with the
highest possible rating being 5.
E'uture Needs
The survey responses indicate the need for support or
opportunities for improvement in two principle categories —
first, education and training support (seminars, workshops,
additional material, etc.) and second, communications (better
understanding of program goals and needs and assistance on
communication techniques).
Th re have been some fundamental issues raised in responses.
Small r firms have asked for a system to prioritize their
efforts and address what they perceive as "small quantity —
low risk" situations.
In addition, there is a recurring theme
of "t 11 me what I must do to comply." CMA has not provided
such details in the past and none are currently planned in this
program.
Conclusion
The preliminary results indicate that there is a significant
amount of activity underway by members in the area covered by
the policy.
A more complete response is needed to assess the
ov rail impact of the policy upon the chemical industry.
As soon as the final survey results are available, they will be
provided to the Board and the membership as well as
incorporated into our advocacy programs.
Identified needs are
currently being evaluated and incorporated in planned
activities.
Action Requested

SPECIAL ENERGY ADVISORY GROUP
INTERIM REPORT ON ACTIVITIES AND STATUS OF
ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL FEEDSTOCK ISSUES
Background
On April 1, 1986, the CMA Board approved the Finance and Executive
Committees' recommendation to sunset the Energy Committee and related
program expenses as of May 31, 1986. To continue to monitor and
evaluate energy and related petrochemical feedstock issues affecting
the entire chemical industry, the Executive Committee authorized
formation of the Special Energy Advisory Group (SEAG).
It was to
operate without any significant dues-funded resources of CMA. The SEAG
is hereby presenting an interim report on its activities and the status
of energy and petrochemical feedstock issues. As part of the Finance
Committee's review of program priorities for the 1987/88 budget, the
Finance Committee will review the activities of the group and the
status of energy issues and make a recommendation to the Executive
Committee to either continue, expand or sunset the SEAG for the 1987/88
fiscal year.
1986 Structure and Accomplishments
Because most SEAG members have long been involved with
energy/feedstock/economic impact matters, the cadre of sixteen
experienced individuals, operating as a committee of the whole (see
appendix), were able to deal rapidly and effectively with key issues.
SEAG issue leaders are responsible for identifying specific energy
legislative or regulatory initiatives having potential for significant
economic impact on the chemical industry. SEAG also has provided
support for Government Relations action on legislative matters.
To determine the economic impact of changes in energy policy, SEAG
calculated chemical industry oil and gas cost at third quarter 1986
market prices to be $11 billion/year. Proposed oil import taxes in
several bills introduced in 1986 would support crude oil at $22/barrel
and thereby Increase chemical industry oil and gas costs by $5
billion/year. While this would impact unfavorably on all manufacturing
industries, the chemical industry would be the most affected. A
Wharton study shows that oil and gas costs are more than 25% of final
chemical product costs, the highest of all manufacturing sectors.
By way of comparison, a 55/barrel import tax on crude oil and imported
petroleum products would increase chemical industry costs almost five
times as much as the proposed Superfund feedstock chemical tax
increases which CMA worked so hard and successfully to avoid in 1986.
In mid-1986, congressmen from oil producing states introduced oil
import tax proposals. These proposals were opposed categorically by
the Administration. As the year progressed, political pressure in oil
producing states led the Administration to initiate an energy security
study that considered a $5 and 510/barrel oil import tax. SEAG
prepared an analysis of the unfavorable impact of such a tax on the
chemical industry. The analysis showed a possible increase in
CMA 038731
petrochemical imports from 14% to as high as 90%. CMA submitted the
analysis to the Administration and SEAG members explained its content
in visits with members of the President's task force. Although no
softening of the Administration's opposition to an oil import tax was
evident in these visits, release of the energy security study was
delayed for two months to consider additional input, implying a
possible shift in emphasis.
In addition to work on energy taxes, SEAG also accomplished the
following:
At the request of the Executive Committee, prepared a study of
the (Waxman) acid rain bill. This study showed a potential $1
billion/year cost increase to the chemical industry for steam,
process energy and electricity. This study was used by CMA in the
congressional debate on acid rain legislation;
Developed materials for CMA's successful effort to eliminate
duplicative energy reporting;
Addressed proposed fuel use and natural gas legislative issues;
and,
Responded to FERC dockets dealing with access to competitive
natural gas transportation and preferential treatment of
interstate pipeline marketing affiliates.
1987 Outlook
Increase in Energy Activity.
In 1987 energy issues will be more
active in both legislative and regulatory arenas. This increase in
activity is expected for the following reasons:
. The recent change in Congressional leadership;
. The high priority of energy-related environmental
issues, (such as acid rain);
. Increasing U.S. dependency on foreign energy sources;
. Deterioration of the U.S. trade balance and,
. Continuing budget deficits.
Key Issues. As mentioned earlier, oil and gas costs are more than
25% of final chemical product costs, which is the highest of all
manufacturing sectors. Any actions that raise oil and gas costs by
such a level have a great impact on the chemical industry. As an
example, if crude oil is supported at 522/barrel by oil import taxes,
then oil and gas costs would Increase $5 billion/year. Key Issues that
may affect energy and petrochemical feedstock costs are listed below:
. Oil Import Taxes and Energy Security. The primary energy
issue will be oil import taxes and energy security measures.
CMA 038732
Relative changes in domestic and foreign oil and gas costs are
vitally important to international competitiveness of the U.S.
chemical industry.
. Energy Cost Impact of Environmental Regulation. Energy cost
is also a major consideration in determining the economic
impact of environmental legislation and regulation. There is
a need to evaluate the energy cost implications of environmental
controls.
. Natural Gas Issues. Regulatory changes affecting cost,
supply and access to transportation of natural gas will continue
to effect chemical industry costs. CMA needs to respond to
those initiatives or propose more appropriate initiatives
geared to making gas markets more competitive in 1987.
. Energy Productivity. Finally, there exists continued concern
on Capitol Hill and in the Administration that energy
productivity is being lost with lower current energy costs.
CMA needs to be prepared to show that the industrial energy
conservation ethic has not been lost even though 1986
legislation has eliminated the industrial energy conservation
reporting program.
. Competitiveness Issue*. CMA members have a vital interest in
government policies affecting energy and petrochemical
feedstocks because they are of substantial economic significance
and determine the competitiveness and long term viability of our
industry. Proposed trade legislation and regulations must be
reviewed by SEAG (in coordination with CMA*s International Trade
Committee) to assess the economic impact of energy cost changes
related to those bills.
SEAG Operation and Resources.
In 1986, SEAG operated with minimal
staff assistance and no funding for additional economic studies or
other outside support, SEAG has operated efficiently, but in view of
renewed Congressional interest in energy taxes and other energy issues,
the current CMA resources will likely not be adequate to meet the needs
of the industry.
In addition, the group effort has been tied to
economic impact studies prepared in 1985 and 1986. These studies must
be updated to be relevant in the 1987 energy debate.
Action Required. None at this time - for information only.
Issue
information and potential resource requirements will be submitted to
the Finance Committee for its consideration with respect to the 1987/88
operations of SEAG,

REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN
Special Programs Policy Committee
to the
CMA Board of Directors
January 26,
1987
The Special Programs Policy Committee was chartered
by the Board of Directors in 1985.
On behalf of the Executive
Committee and Board, and in conjunction with CMA standing
committees, SPPC helps ensure that all Special Programs are
conducted in a manner consistent with Association policy and
with the Special Programs Guidelines.
It also counsels with
Special Programs regarding the appropriateness of current
policy provisions; and reviews reports and recommendations from
the Special Programs Division staff regarding new and revised
operating procedures.
SPPC recommendations for changes of
policy are reported to the Executive Committee and Board of
Directors, via the President,, for final approval and action.
In the past year, SPPC has received no requests from
Special Program panel chairmen to review current policy.
To
ensure that the views of chairmen are obtained, and in keeping
with its mandate, SPPC plans to meet in the next few months
with a representative group of panel chairmen.
The purpose of
the meeting will be to solicit the chairmen's views on adequacy
and appropriateness of current policy provisions.
In the past year, no conflicts between conduct of
Special Programs and Association policy have been noted by
SPPC.
In our opinion. Program actions and CMA policy remain
in concert.
Based on these observations, we conclude that the
safeguards implicit in the SPPC process are adequately serving
the Special Programs and the Association, We recommend contin­
uation of this oversight mechanism.
In keeping with this recommendation, we also wish to
remind the Board of its suggestion in 1980, that all single
product consortia be chartered under the umbrella cTf a trade
association.
The reason given for this suggestion was that
ad hoc groups' actions may, "... adversely affect the contin­
uity, consistency of position, and long-term litigation plans
of CMA or allied organizations." Just as importantly, affilia­
tion with a trade association more effectively shields consortia
from implications of antitrust violations than does ad hoc status,
and thereby helps protect member companies,
while most single
product consortia now affiliate with a trade association, there
remain a few that do not. Membership in each of these
hoc
croups includes CMA member companies.
We ask that you evaluate
ycur company's participation in these groups and take steps to
bring the aa hoc consortia into an association.

International Trade Committee
Annual Report to CMA Board of Directors
January 26, 1987
The competitive position of the U.S, chemical Industry In world markets
is Increasingly affected by policies of both U.S. and foreign governments.
CMA's International Trade Committee (ITC) devotes the majority of Its efforts
to analyzing issues affecting trade related matters, alerting CMA members to
these issues, and developing position papers for CMA Board approval that will
help Influence government trade and investment policies which affect the
international competitiveness of the U.S. chemical Industry. Both the
Administration and the Congress have indicated that, during 1987, much
attention and emphasis is going to be placed on the competitiveness of all
domestic industries in the international marketplace. This emphasis will
probably translate into changes in current U.S. laws, policies and practices
in areas including trade. Investment, fiscal and monetary, worker education,
third world debt and others that may be adversely affecting the international
competitiveness of many domestic companies faced with increasing U.S. imports
and decreasing U.S. exports. The ITC plans to continue efforts in helping CMA
to favorably influence the effect of such changes on the U.S. chemical
industry.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE HIGHLIGHTS AN*D MAJOR COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES IX 1986
Trade Highlights
The 99eh United States Congress and the Administration were widely
divided on most major trade issues In 1986. As a result of this division (and
more politically pressing matters like elections and tax reform), no new major
trade legislation or reform was enacted. There was a lot of Congressional
Committee and Staff work on H.&. 4300 and S. 1860, including a number of
Committee Hearings, but only the House passed an omnibus Trade Bill (H.R.
4800). The Senate Finance Committee did not act on H.R. 4800, but used
S. 1860 and a later Committee Staff draft for purposes of some 9 separate
hearings. The Senate Finance Committee did narrowly approve negotiating
authority for the USTR. to negotiate with Canada on a proposed Bilateral Free
Trade Agreement. Ocher relevant trade highlights and initiatives taken during
1986 Included:
U.S. trade deficit for 1986 is at about $165 billion, a $15 billion
increase from the $150 billion deficit in 1985.
U.S. chemical industry trade surplus is estimated to be up about 5Z,
the first increase in surplus since 1980. There had been 5 years of
declining surplus from $12.1 billion surplus in 1980 to $7,2 billion
in 1985. Estimates for 1986 indicate a 1986 chemical trade surplus of

legislation very early. The House has indicated that the new Omnibus Trade
Bill will be almost the same as H.R. 4800 and has tentatively been assigned
bill number H.R. 3 in Che 100th Congress. The Senate Finance Committee, under
its new chairman* Senator Bencsen* and the Trade Subcommittee under its new
chairman, Senator Spark Matsunaga, have also given indications that new Senate
trade legislation will basically take the form of their old bill, S. 1860, as
modified by the Committee Staff draft in late 1986, and will be introduced in
January, 1987. Senator Bentsen has already announced that the Finance

OUTLOOK FOR INTERNATIONA! TRADE ACTIVITIES IN 1987
Focus of Committee Activities
The ITC will continue to concentrate Its primary efforts on the trade
initiatives already Identified by the Congress and the Administration as
priorities for 1987. Clearly, a major impact on the chemical industry in 1987
could be the short and long term implications of a FTA with Canada being
negotiated and legislatively authorized for implementation. A failure on the
part of the U.S. and Canada to get a mutually beneficial FTA negotiated in
1987 could have a significant adverse effect on a meaningful start to MTN
negotiations in the Uruguay Round.
As both the U.S.-Canada FTA and Uruguay Round negotiations begin in 1987,
the ITC will continue development of position papers (trade modules) to
recommend for CMA approval and advocacy on trade issues chat may affect the
chemical industry. Each of the trade modules we have, and will continue to
develop, are primarily intended to provide CMA with appropriate responses to
trade issue position inquiries. These inquiries have, and are likely to
continue to come from Che Congress and the Administration on important issues
that are surely to be contained in Che U.S.-Canada FTA and MTN Uruguay Round,
heparately, the chemical.industry may also have significant interest in some
Mi the current U.S. trade law revisions that may be introduced as trade reform
legislation ir. the 100th Congress. The trade-related issues, as trade modules
or trade lav revisions, chat the ITC is currently developing include:

REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT
ASSOCIATION PROGRAM AND ISSUE REPORT
ADVOCACY OVERVIEW
A. Congress
Since January, 1981, Democrats have controlled the House, and
Republicans the Presidency and the Senate. As the 100th Congress
prepares to convene on January 6th, we will return to a more familiar
type of government -- a Republican White House and a Democrat controlled Congress.
Amid the changes wrought by a shift in control of the Senate,
both Republicans and Democrats moved quickly to reelect their current
leaders for another two years. Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd
(D-WV) has stated that after Congress convenes, Senate Democrats will
begin legislative work January 12, breaking with recent Congressional
tradition of waiting until after the President's State of the Union
address, scheduled for January 27.
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-TX) has said that Congress could
within a month clear legislation reauthorizing the Clean Water Act,
which President Reagan killed by pocket veto last year.
It is also
anticipated that Congress will move quickly to authorize special
committees to investigate the Iran arms-contra aid affair, introduce
trade legislation and begin tackling the Administration's record $1.02
trillion 1988 budget proposal. The Administration has estimated the
deficit at about $150 billion, while the Congressional Budget Office
and other analysts have estimated it at closer to $170 billion. House
Budget Committee Chairman William H. Gray III (D-PA) has said that to
meet deficit goals, Congress may be forced to consider tax increases,
citing, as examples, "without touching personal income tax", changing
the nation's tariff system and increasing surcharges on some imported
products.
Other Issues that will confront the 100th Congress and which are
of particular concern to the chemical industry include pesticide and
acid rain legislation, product liability, and emphasis on work place
concerns - an area where labor shows signs of greater political
activity. Trade reform legislation, another priority of the new
Congress, will most likely be protectionist and CMA is prepared to
take an active role in the forthcoming debate with positions on
numerous facets of existing trade law.
With the current agenda and the usual uncertainties of a new
session, 1987 will be another busy and difficult year for the Congress.

Environmental Protection Agency fEPA). The Agency has
announced Its intention to use Superfund monies to fund Right-to-Know
activities required by Title III of the Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act of 1986. CMA, key members of Congress and some
press reporters have already spoken out against bleeding the Superfund
to carry out activities required by other statutes. Title III is in
fact a separate Act from CERCLA, much like the Clean Air Act or Clean
Water Act. EPA's difficulty lies in the fact that Congress created
deadlines under Title III, but failed to provide any funds to conduct
those programs.

House and Senate leaders insist they will have a trade bill to
the President by May. With control of the Senate now held by the
Democrats, the commitment seems firm. Even though the House passed a
bill last year and the Senate almost did, there are some
uncertainties. New and tougher actions against imports are certain to
be included. The textlie/apparel bill vetoed by the President last
year (sustained) may be Included. Senator Bentsen, now chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee, says he will likely include an oil
import tax.
The President says he wants nothing in a trade bill except
authority to negotiate the Multilateral Trade Negotiations (Min).
Whether he can, or whether he will, work with the Congress on an
acceptable bill is not known now. There is almost no common ground
for the White House and Congress and the result may be a veto battle.
Bargaining in the MTN has started with all the usual fighting for
position by participants. Not much progress can be announced in the
early months but much groundwork will be laid. The chemical industry
wants no tariff cuts on products proved to be import sensitive.
Attempts to get legislative language to this effect are underway.
The U.S./Canada negotiations toward a free trade arrangement is
moving along though with difficulties constantly appearing. Canadian
officials are hard-pressed by opponents of an agreement. Pressure
grows for settlement by late in 1987 to beat the President's
bargaining authorization limit of January 3, 1988. There is
considerable doubt this deadline can be met.
Preliminary data shows that the 41 percent decline of the
chemical trade balance in the period 1980-1985 has reversed. The
estimate is for a 7.6 billion dollar balance, a 5 percent increase
over the year before. Most of the credit goes to a weaker dollar.
The International Affairs Group (IAG) has undertaken an effort to
ensure greater cooperation among chemical trade associations
worldwide. Several foreign trade associations have expressed interest
in maintaining closer contact with CMA, and the new effort will
2
CMA 038744
attempt to increase the IAG's visibility as a contact and advocate for
the U.S. chemical industry on an international scale. The IAG
believes that interaction with our foreign counterparts may profitably
be made on the emerging global issues affecting health, safety and the
environment.
States
During the last two months of 1986, less than six state
legislatures were in session. However, there were a few significant
state government activities of major significance to the chemical
industry.
Without doubt, the most significant event was the passage of the
California Toxic Initiative or Proposition 65. Despite a major public
relations campaign by industry, the initiative was approved 63% to
37%. The industry coalition will remain intact to address the
implementation of the new law. The first deadline is March 1, 1987,
when the Governor must publish a list of affected chemicals. On
March 1, 1988 the warning provisions go into effect and on November 1,
1989 the discharge prohibitions become effective. After a thorough
legal review of all possible options, the coalition decided to delay
any legal attempts to postpone or to alter the law until after its
implementation has begun.
The CMA State Affairs Committee has established a special ad hoc
group to help develop a response to this law in California as well as
its potential spread to other states.
State legislative action will reach a peak in the next couple of
months, as all but a couple of states will be in session. Tort
Reform/Iiiability Insurance will continue to be a major issue among the
states in 1987. While some sort of tort reform legislation was passed
in 35 states in 1986, injuries involving hazardous substances were
partially, or in some cases, completely excluded from some of the
significant reforms.
Following the Third Circuit Court's decision to essentially
uphold the Pennsylvania Right-To-Know Law, there was an appeal to the
United States Supreme Court. Until the court decides whether or not
to accept the case, there is an injunction against the implementation
of the law as it applies to manufacturers.
Thanks in part to the efforts of the New Jersey Chemical Industry
Council, the Council of State Governments (CSG) deferred action on the
possible adoption of the New Jersey Environmental Responsibility
Cleanup Act (ECRA) as model legislation. However, some form of ECRA
model legislation will be adopted by CSG in 1987 and CMA's ECRA Work
Group continues to work towards a favorable model.
Chemical plant safety will al3s continue to be a major issue
among the states in 1987 and the CMA State Affairs/ Environmental
Management Work Group has developed an issue analysis document that
was recently distributed to member companies and state CICs.
3
In summary, 1987 should be a very active year for the chemical
industry at the state level.
In the November elections, the public
again spoke strongly for increased environmental protection by state
government. They also elected a majority of Democrats to the extent
that 67 out 98 state houses are now controlled by Democrats. This
will be an increasingly formidable task this year in light of member
company state affairs staff reductions.
Media
Beginning in November media coverage of business news increased
substantially -- accounting for nearly 12 percent of the news in major
national newspapers and on network television. Recent Iran/Contra
coverage has interrupted the growth in business news but it remains a
substantial part of coverage.
Over the past several years coverage of business news was
essentially positive. Business was seen as offering an alternative to
governmental problem solving.
Recently, however, nearly 50 percent of coverage has been
negative, setting a dark background for legislative and regulatory
activities. Issues like insider trading, chemical spills, ozone
depletion, water contamination, and charges of poor management have
led the charge. The rush of year-end takeovers accelerated the level
of nervousness in coverage.
Ivan Boesky, and the fallout from the SEC investigation,
confirmed for many Americans deep suspicions about Wall Street and, by
extension, about business ethics. Even a baby food manufacturer was
charged with dilution of its product. Several members of the chemical
industry were charged with illegal product formulation.
Add a lack of trust in the President's handling of Iran and
Contra aid and public bad feelings about big government and big
business have again surfaced.
Although water issues have been slow to develop in the U.S., the
h avy coverage of contamination problems in Switzerland have raised
public awareness. Even a minor event in this country could bring
extensive coverage and perhaps force earlier consideration of water
issues in Congress.
Finally, even though editorial opinion in California newspapers
was overwhelmingly opposed to Proposition 65 (29 no, 1 yes), popular
press coverage was just as overwhelmingly in support of it. The
Hollywood stars' press caravan organized by Jane Fonda offered
interviews and media events and worked well in gaining popular votes.
The same tactic will be less usable in other states.
The latest public opinion polls show most Americans today believe
companies are more concerned than they used to be about waste
disposal, but by a two-thirds majority they say they don't see enough
action to solve the problems. By the highest record in the
4
CMA 038746
Cambridge Reports history 60 percent of Americans are calling for
more environmental regulation, even though they do not see
environmental conditions getting worse. They're just tired of waiting
for action.
ISSUES AND PROGRAM STATUS
Regulation of Chemicals fTSCA and related)
1. Congressional Developments and Response
TSCA Reauthorization.
The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was signed into law in
1976. Since then, its chemical control provisions have not been
significantly amended, other than the asbestos in schools requirements
recently adopted in the 99th Congress.
Its administration by the
Environmental Protection Agency continues to evolve and mature.
While other various legislative changes have been proposed in
past years, none have been acted upon by Congress. Expenditures under
the Act have not been reauthorized since FY 1983, as the Agency has
relied upon the appropriations process for funding. Consequently,
TSCA reauthorization hearings may be ahead of us in 1987. However, it
is too early to predict whether and when. Congressman Jim Florio's
(D-NJ) staff has indicated TSCA will be on his priority list, but his
Subcommittee and its jurisdiction must be confirmed in
January-February, 1987, before he can go to work on legislation.
Oversight hearings and possible biotechnology amendments are also a
realistic possibility in the new Congress.
2. Regulatory Developments and Response
Regulation of Biotechnology.
In June Federal policies
governing biotechnology regulation were issued by the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy and five federal agencies.
CMA's Biotechnology Task Group submitted comments to EPA concerning
its regulation of biotechnology under the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA) and the Federal Insecticide Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA). CMA's comments stated that adequate authority exists under
TSCA and FIFRA to control the commercial uses of biotechnology, and
included recommendations for avoiding unreasonable burdens on
biotechnology producers. CMA expressed its concern that certain
aspects of EPA's approach are overly stringent and depart from prior
precedents under TSCA.
EPA's current schedule is to publish proposed rules under the
framework in late 1987. The Biotechnology Task Group will continue to
monitor the development of the proposed rules and comments as
appropriate.
Management of Information at EPA. Members of the Information
Management Task Group (IMTG) met with EPA staff from the
5
CMA 038747
Administration and Resources Management; Policy, Planning and
Evaluation; and Pesticides and Toxic Substances Divisions to discuss
the Agency's collection and management of health and environmental
data in chemicals.
IMTG's recommendations for improved information management at the
Agency include:
The EPA Administrator should mandate an Agencywide policy
stressing its commitment to information management and
dissemination.
A high-level, clearly designated focal point within the
Agency should be created to administer such a policy.
A separate line item for information management should be
created in the Agency's budget.
The IMTG will work with EPA staft during 1987 on the issues of
redundancy of information requests by the Agency; promoting the use of
TOSCATS (EPA computer data, base) by industry; sharing of expertise
about information management; and Confidential Business Information.
The IMTG will meet again with EPA staff on the broader information
management issues.
Communication with EPA and OSHA. Members of the HSC External
Affairs Task Group (EXATG) met with industry liaison staff at EPA and
OSHA to discuss the chemical industry's communications with the
agencies, and key issues of importance to industry and the agencies.
The EXATG will identify the issues, and CMA representatives and agency
representatives working on the issues will increase one-on-one
communication at all working levels during the rulemaking process.
Testing Consent Agreements Under TSCA. The first meeting of a
joint industry/govemment/environment group took place on November 20,
1986, to discuss procedures governing testing consent agreements under
Section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (51 Fed. Reg.
23706, et seq.. June 30, 1986). The group was formed as a result of
a CMA meeting with Dr. John A. Moore, EPA Assistant Administrator for
Pesticides and Toxic Substances, in late October, 1986, on
implementation of testing consent agreements. Participants at the
November 20 meeting agreed that industry and EPA could achieve better
cooperative planning when specific chemicals are recommended for
testing. Joint industry/EPA meetings to resolve issues relevant to
testing consent agreements will continue in 1987.
3. Policy Development, Analytical and Program Activities
Risk Evaluation of New Chemicals. The Health and Safety
Committee/Notification and Reporting Task Group has developed a
guideline for evaluating the potential risks of new chemicals. The
guideline is intended to promote sound risk evaluations and to
encourage companies to submit risk evaluation to EPA with their
6
premanufacture notices. CMA will promote the guideline in a workshop
with EPA to be held in the first quarter of 1987,
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IAKO.
IARC
Monograph meetings were held in December, 1986, in Lyon to evaluate
the genetic activity of 200+ chemicals/exposures. CMA was represented
by Dale W. Matheson, Ph.D., of Stauffer Chemical Company. Richard H.
McKee, Ph.D., of Exxon Biomedical Sciences was chosen as Dr. Matheson's
alternate.
In a report to the CMA IARC Work Group that has managed
the U.S. industry/IARC interface during 1986, Dr. Matheson noted
IARC's favorable reception of industry positions, and adherence to
sound scientific concepts and objectivity in technical discussions at
the meetings.
In March, 1987, IARC plans to hold another series of Monograph
meetings at which the same group of chemicals will be evaluated for
their overall carcinogenicity. Robert J. Moolenaar, Ph.D., of Dow
Chemical Company, has been designated as the CMA Observer at these
meetings. Dr. McKee of Exxon will again serve as the alternate. The
CMA Hazard Assessment Task Group is preparing Drs. Moolenaar and McKee
for the meetings by assembling and consolidating member company
reviews on specific chemicals.
The paper entitled "Review and Recommendations For the Revision
of the Preamble and Criteria of the IARC Monographs"
(CMA/AIHC/API/NACA/PMA; July 31, 1986) has been widely announced and
distributed among author association memberships, scientific contacts,
and other interested groups. The document was prepared to provide
IARC with critical scientific comments on the criteria used to make
carcinogenicity evaluations.
Developmental Toxicity Testing. A paper entitled "A Tier
System for Developmental Toxicity Evaluations Based on Considerations
of Exposure and Effect Relationships," by E. Marshall Johnson, Ph.D.,
of Jefferson Medical College, has been accepted for publication in
Teratology. CMA's Health and Safety Committee commissioned the
paper to help establish reasonable, scientific guidelines for priority
setting in developmental toxicity testing. The Hazard Assessment Task
Group has distributed the manuscript to member companies for review.
Occupational and Public Safety
1. Congressional Developments and Response
Occupational Disease Notification.
In the 99th Congress, H.R.
1309 passed Rep. Gaydos' (D-PA) Subcommittee with only one dissenting
vote.
It was reported out of the full Education and Labor Committee
by 20-8 (all the Committee Democrats and one Republican voting for
It did not reach the House floor in part because of our
business community efforts to educate Members of the House as to the
flaws in the measure, and in part because of a crowded end-of-session
calendar. Senator Howard Metzenbaum's (D-OH) S. 2050 received one day
of hearing in the Subcommittee of the Labor & Human Resources
Committee.

CMA 038749
Louisiana, in fact, has already set up a state planning commission and
the Louisiana Chemical Association (LCA) is a member of the planning
commission with Mr. Fred Loy, President of the LCA, serving as
Chairman of the commission.
The Council of Chemical Association Executives (CCAE), which
represents about 50 industry trade groups, recently expanded the role
of its CAER Task Group. The task group, chaired by CMA, was set up to
assist the CCAE participants in implementing CAER with their
memberships. Now the task group has the additional responsibility of
coordinating the emergency planning and community right-to-know issues
of Title III for the CCAE. The task group is focusing on setting up
joint CCAE workshops on Title III and, as necessary, coordinating an
industry approach to EPA rulemaking under this Act.
2. Policy Development, Analytical and Program Activities
On December 12, 1986, Mr. Edward L. Mahoney, President of the
Adhesives Manufacturers Association (AMA), wrote to Mr. Roland stating
the following, "It is my pleasure on behalf of the members of the
Adhesives Manufacturers Association to formerly endorse and express
our strong support for the Community Awareness and Emergency Response
(CAER) program as developed by the Chemical Manufacturers
Association. AMA's decision to endorse the CAER program was
unanimously adopted during a recent meeting of the board of
directors. You and your staff are to be commended for your initiative
and professional implementation of this concept which will be of
significant benefit to the impacted communities and their citizens as
well as the chemical industry. The CAER program becomes even more
relevent in view of the recent Suporfund amendments, particularly the
Title III notification requirements."
3. International Aspects
ABIQUIM officials (the Brazilian chemical manufacturers
association) have invited CMA representatives to meet with them on
February 3, 1987, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. CMA officials are also
working to arrange meetings at that time with local Brazilian agency
officials. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss the CAER and
NCRIC initiatives.
4. Outreach Activity
Through letters to CMA executive contacts, company CAER
coordinators, and local communities, CMA unveiled the CAER recognition
program. This program helps communities participating in CAER-type
programs to receive recognition for their planning efforts. The
program consists of two awards. The level one award, which is a
hand-lettered and framed certificate, is awarded to communities that
can show they have formed a CAER planning committee. The level two
award, which is an oak and bronze plaque, is awarded to communitias
that have completed the CAER milestones.
9
caught the attention of Members of Congress with its use of the new
cleanup standards at a Superfund site. EPA is attempting to provide
some flexibility in the cleanup standards, but Congressional critics
contend the new law does not allow that flexibility. We can expect
that Congress will conduct oversight hearings on this issue. Also,
there have been reports that EPA may be using Superfund money for the
implementation of Title III, the Right-to-Know section.
In passing
Superfund, Congress specifically made Title III separate from
Superfund and said that it should receive funding through the
appropriation process. This was intended to mean that the Superfund
trust fund money would not be used for Title III. CMA sent a letter
(December 31, 1986) to EPA Administrator Lee Thomas expressing our
concern with his attempt to use Superfund money to implement Title
III.
The Government Relations Committee's Superfund Task Group will be
following very closely these two issues and others that develop during
the Superfund implementation process.
Regulatory Developments and Response
Section 313 Notification Form. CMA submitted comments on an
EPA draft of a notification form to implement the reporting
requirements of Section 313 of the Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization. The final notification form will be the basis for
formal reporting requirements under Title III. CMA's comments
generally supported the concepts for reporting outlined in the draft
form. CMA did raise concerns with the disclosure of estimate
calculations, the need for da minimus concentrations, trade secret
provisions, removal efficiency provisions, and chemical use
designation.
3. Policy Development, Analytical and Program Activities
Superfund Implementation Workshop. CMA has developed a two-day
workshop that focuses on the important new requirements of the new
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986. The workshop to
be held on January 28 and 29, 1987, in New Orleans, LA, will address
the amended clean up provisions and the new Title III -- Emergency
Planning and Community Rlght-To-Know company responsibilities. The
workshop ia designed to provide an overview of the new legal
provisions, outline the new requirements for companies, and highlight
the activities companies should be planning for or doing now.
4. Litigation and Related Legal Activities
Insurance Litigation Activities. Following up on discussions
at the first meeting of the ad hoc group on Superfund/insurance
issues, the Office of General Counsel has filed amicus briefs in two
Important Insurance coverage cases. The issues in these cases concern
when an "occurrence" occurs for purposes of environmental liabilities
under comprehensive general liability (CGL) policies and whether
Superfund cleanup costs can be considered as "damages" under CGL
policies.
Both issues will have an important impact on whether member
11
CMA 038753
companies can seek coverage for Superfund liabilities under CGL
policies. The insurance industry has apparently formed a corporation
to act as the funding source and coordinating body to pursue its
activities in key insurance cases.
In response, the Office of General
Counsel is seeking the participation of other interested associations
to organize to respond on behalf of insured companies in some of these
cases.
Regulatory Litigation. The Office of General Counsel is
currently engaged in two key court actions challenging regulations in
the Superfund area.
In the National Contingency Plan (NCP)
litigation, CMA and the other petitioners are meeting with the
government to discuss possible resolution of the challenge in light of
Superfund reauthorization and the forthcoming revision of the NCP
required by that statute.
In the other suit, CMA has challenged the
final natural resource damage assessment regulations promulgated by
the Department of Interior. Several states and one environmental
group have also challenged the regulations. The litigation is in a
preliminary stage, pending consolidation of the eases and the setting
of a briefing schedule by the court.
Superfund Implementation Activities. As part of its Superfund
implementation effort, the Office of General counsel will be working
with the Ad Hoc Superfund Counsel Group to pursue ways to improve the
settlement process under Superfund. This group includes Superfund
lawyers from member companies who are interested in sharing concerns
arising out of their Superfund case experiences. As part of its
activities, the group will be looking at EPA and Department of Justice
enforcement and settlement policies and can serve as a resource for
CMA advocacy activities in these areas.
5. Communications
The department wrote an article for the EPA Journal on the
potential effects of the amended RCRA and the reauthorized Superfund
laws on waste-disposing industries.
Hazardous Waste Management fRCRA)
1. Congressional Developments and Response
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act is scheduled to be
reauthorized in 1988. Throughout 1987, Congress will be closely
evaluate Environmental Protection Agency's implementation progress.
The CMA RCRA Regulations Task Groups continue to be very active
in reviewing the RCRA regulations and providing guidance for their
implementation.
In preparation for the 100th Congress, both the
Technical and Government Relations Task Groups have been discussing
issues that they believe need to be addressed in the RCRA
reauthorization debate. The task groups have identified a number of
issues of potential concern to the chemical Industry. These issues
will be used as a starting point for discussion of possible
legislative changes.
12
CMA 038764
CMA is actively communicating with members of Congress and Hill
staff who will be working on RCRA issues in the next Congress.
Oversight hearings will be held throughout 1987/88 on various aspects
of RCRA.
The RCRA task group will he conducting two important activities
early in 1987. First, they will conduct a seminar/briefing for CMA
Washington representatives on the 1984 RCRA amendments implementation
and the outlook for legislative changes in 1987/88.
The second task group activity would be a briefing by CMA for key
Hill staff on RCRA implementation and its impact on the chemical
industry. This would create an opportunity to discuss with key Hill
staff some of the technical problems the chemical industry faces and
how we perceive implementation of the 1984 RCRA Amendments.
RCRA oversight hearings can be anticipated throughout 1987/88.
In the Senate, Senator Max Baucus (D-MT) will be taking the lead in
the RCRA reauthorization.
In the House, we expect Congressman John
Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Jim Florio (D-NJ) to be the most active
in RCRA oversight hearings.
The RCRA debate will evolve slowly, with the oversight hearings
focusing on EPA's implementation of the 1984 Amendments. CMA will
continue to provide information to key members of Congress and their
staff.
Waste Minimization Program.
The Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA) requires that companies establish voluntary waste
minimization programs for their operations and certify their actions.
In 1988, RCRA is scheduled to be reauthorized. At that time.
Congress will closely evaluate the progress that has been made in the
waste minimization program. If progress is inadequate. Congress will
seriously consider legislating mandatory waste reduction requirements.
Many CMA member companies have a well-established waste
minimization program in place; the companies have generally not
communicated this activity and its results to the public and Congress.
CMA's waste minimization work group is developing a plan for
communicating with member companies, the Congress and EPA, and the
general public. CMA has been meeting with congressional staff to
discuss this issue. At this point, it appears that waste minimization
will be a priority issue over the next few years.
It is very
important that CMA member companies focus on this issue now. Although
very little activity is expected in the first part of 1987, waste
minimization will be an emerging issue over the next two years.
Underground Inlection Committee. The 1984 RCRA amendments
require EPA to determine whether underground injection should remain
an option for the disposal of hazardous waste. Several environmental
groups, led by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), have made
the elimination of underground injection one of their major
13
CMA 038755
priorities. An EPA ban on new legislation prohibiting underground
injection would directly affect the chemical industry, which is the
major user of underground injection for the disposal of hazardous
waste.
In an effort to answer the NRDC opposition to underground
injection, the CMA Underground Injection Control Task Group has been
contacting Congressmen who have disposal wells in their districts to
reassure them about the safety of the technology. These contacts are
expected to continue on a regular basis as long as environmentalist
opposition to underground injection persists.
Although no hearings will be held specifically on underground
injection in early 1987, we expect the issue to be addressed in RCRA
oversight hearings throughout the year. The introduction of any
groundwater legislation may also touch upon the practice of
underground injection.
CMA will continue to comnunicata with Congress on underground
injection. The issue will begin to receive more attention when
Congress returns in January 1987.
2. Regulatory Developments and Response
Land Disposal Prohibition Comments. CMA submitted comments on
EPA's announcement of the availability of data and request for
comments on proposed land disposal restrictions. The final rule will
address the treatment requirements for disposing of specified
hazardous wastes in landfills. CMA's comments address the variability
factor calculation, the outlier test, data base modifications, and
variance from a treatment standard.
3. Policy Development, Analytical and Program Activities
RCRA Regulations Workshop. CMA sponsored a RCRA Regulations
Workshop on December 11-12, 1986. Approximately 170 member company
representatives participated in the two-day workshop. CMA and EPA
representatives addressed a wide spectrum of RCRA implementation
issues, i.e., land disposal ban provisions, organic toxicity proposal,
EPA hazardous waste strategy, minimum technology and retrofit
requirements, closure requirements, hazardous waste tank rules, and
corrective action requirements.
4. Litigation and Related Activities
CMA v. EPA (Closure rulel. CMA is challenging EPA's final
closure rule that could severely limit the useful life of an
impoundment or landfill to receive nonhazardous waste after it stops
receiving hazardous waste. The rule requires the unit to be closed
within 180 days of the final receipt of hazardous waste. As such, the
unit could not be used for the disposal of nonhazardous waste. EPA
has agreed to enter into settlement negotiations, with the briefing
schedule stayed for ninety days. CMA has proposed alternatives other
than retrofitting impoundments with double liners and leachate
collection systems.
14
CMA 038756
Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. EPA (Land Disposal
Rastrlctions). CMA has intervened in a challenge by the Hazardous
Waste Treatment Council to EPA's November 7, 1986, final rule
restricting the land disposal of solvents and dioxins. CMA will
support EPA's rule that if there is insufficient capacity to treat a
waste, the waste can be placed in an existing unit that is not
double-lined for up to two years while capacity is being developed.
CMA plans to challenge other aspects of EPA's final rule.
Specifically, CMA will challenge the fact that the treatment levels
required for solvents and dioxins are set at concentrations that are
even below the concentrations EPA proposes to use for considering such
compounds to be hazardous wastes. CMA will also challenge EPA's
limitation of "no migration" petitions to individual wastes at
individual units. "No migration" petitions seek an exception from the
ban on land disposal. Finally, CMA may challenge EPA's requirement to
use a zero headspace extractor (ZHE) for volatiles when assessing the
concentration of wastes to determine if they can be landfilled. The
variability of the ZHE is excessive.
Organic Leachate Model. CMA has petitioned for review of the
Agency's November 13, 1986, rule adopting the organic leachate model
for delisting organic wastes in landfills. CMA will challenge EPA's
refusal to adopt criteria for considering site-specific factors when
deciding to delist hazardous waste. Non-consideration of
site-specific factors will lead to too many wastes being listed as
hazardous wastes and too few being delisted.
Groundwater (Includes Safe Drinking Water Act)
l. Congressional Developments And Response
For some time, CMA has been developing its advocacy position on
federal groundwater legislation. CMA continues to believe groundwater
protection is an important issue. Federal legislation could establish
new concepts for groundwater protection or remediation activities
which will likely result in significant costs to the industry.
It
could also impose use restrictions on certain products, such as
pesticides, detergents, solvents, and others.
It may also result in
new concepts concerning product liability, including federal causes of
action, victims compensation and new taxing mechanisms.
CMA has been a major participant in groundwater issues to date.
CMA took an active role in EPA's development of its National
Groundwater Policy, which was released in August, 1984. CMA has
worked with several state legislatures, an area that has been
particularly active in recent years. Congressional testimony was
presented on four occasions, addressing both groundwater provisions in
the Safe Drinking Water Act and, most recently in October, 1985,
directly on groundwater protection issues.
The Government Relations Committee's Groundwater Task Group has
already begun educating key Congressional staff on some of the
fundamental policy issues. For example, CMA has long felt that
states, and not the Federal Government, should have primary
15
CMA 038767
3. Litigation and Related Legal Activities
RMCL Litigation. Briefing is now completed in the D.C. Circuit
case challenging EPA's Recommended Maximum Contaminant Levels (RMCLs)
for eight synthetic organic substances. EPA has filed its response to
the briefs filed by CMA and the American Petroleum Institute (API)
(jointly), the Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance (HSIA), and the
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). On October 20, 1986, the
challenging parties filed their additional briefs replying to the EPA
position. CMA and API filed separate reply briefs, API concentrating
on the "zero RMCL" issue and CMA briefing the issue, raised by NRDC,
of whether EPA must regulate a substance as a carcinogen if there is
anv evidence of carcinogenicity. Oral argument will be held on
February 27, 1987. A decision is expected in late summer or fall,
1987.
Surface Water
1. Congressional Developments and Response
The 99th Congress unanimously passed the Water Quality Act of
1986 (S. 1128) just prior to adjournment. On October 28, CMA sent a
letter to President Reagan urging him to sign the compromise bill
based upon the programmatic content. The President vetoed the bill on
Novembar 7, citing the SIR Milton price tag for the construction
grants program.
In the 100th Congress, House and Senate leaders have vowed to
introduce the same bill, as H.R. 1 and S. 1. They plan to avoid
referral of the bill to committee and to seek House and Senate
passage, despite threats of floor amendments and another presidential
veto. While committee and subcommittee chairmen responsible for clean
water have changed in both the Senate and the House, the new leaders
say that they are equally committed to passage of the same bill.
CMA continues to be generally supportive of legislation identical
to the former S. 1128, and is working to make certain that the
valuable floor statements that supplemented S. 1128 are repeated and
not compromised by opponents' statements. CMA maintains communication
with other industry and municipal groups regarding clean water
legislation, but continues to serve as the industry leader on its
primary issues.
2. Litigation and Related Legal Activities
Pesticides Effluent Guidelines Litigation. On December 15,
1986, EPA published a notice in the Federal Register removing the
pesticides effluent guidelines from the Code of Federal Regulations
and announcing that those rules "have not been effective as of July
25, 1986." This action was taken as a result of the CMA/NACA lawsuit
challenging the pesticide rules. EPA has informed CMA and NACA that
the Agency plans to "start fresh" in developing the next set of
effluent guidelines for the pesticides industry. EPA will undertake a
17

new data collection effort and will also reevaluate policy and
technical aspects of the methodology used to develop the previous
effluent guidelines. EPA does not expect to issue a new set of final
rules before June, 1991.
Removal Credits Litigation. The Federal Government has decided
not to file an appeal of the Third Circuit's removal credits
decision.
Instead, on December 18, 1936, the government filed a brief
with the Supreme Court responding to the petitions filed by CMA and by
a group of affected parties from Chicago. The government agreed with
CMA that the Third Circuit ruled incorrectly on the sludge issue, and
agreed with CMA that the case would have major impacts on industry.
Nevertheless, the government recommended that the Court not hear the
case, because the government "does not believe that the legal issues
presented warrant further review.” NRDC's response to CMA's petition
was due January 16.
Air
1. Congressional Developments and Response
When the 99th Congress adjourned, all of the acid rain bills —
House and Senate -- had been hindered by interregional conflict and
slowed by opposition from electricity producers and users including
the chemical industry. The only legislation that passed pertaining to
clean air was Title III of Superfund Amendments Reauthorization Act
covering emissions reporting, emergency planning and community
right-to-know.
Early in 1987, the Clean Air Act amendments debate is likely to
resume with focus on acid rain control legislation. Thus, there
probably will be time to consider other amendments to the Clean Air
Act. Three major issues are the 1987 non-attainment deadlines for
ozone and carbon monoxide, air toxics control and fluorocarbon control.
By Spring 1987, clean air hearings probably will be underway in
both the House and Senate. The change in Senate leadership does not
affect the Environment and Public Vorks Committee's agenda for air
legislation. But it does put new Majority Deader Robert Byrd (D-WVA)
in a unique position to influence the outcome of any air legislation
that contains an onerous acid rain control provision.
In the House, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell
(D-MI) remains opposed to onerous acid rain control legislation;
however, ranking minority member Norman Lent (R-N.Y.) was a co-sponsor
f the major Houae acid rain control bill in the 99th Congress. Until
all members of the Committee and of the Health and Environment
Subcommittee are selected, it is difficult to assess potential votes.
. CMA is a major participant in the inter-Industry coalition on
clean air. CMA provides the leadership on the hazardous air
pollutants control issue, but maintains strong input on other
stationary source issues including acid rain.
18
2. Air Toxica Policy Imp lamentation
Air Toxica Resource Manual. CMA has published a comprehensive
resource manual to assist members in implementing the air toxics
control policy. The resource manual was mailed to each member
company's air toxics coordinator. Additional copies are available at
reproduction cost upon request. The manual provides valuable
information to assist member companies in designing appropriate
programs to minimize accidental releases and to control process
emissions. Copies of the resource manual are being provided to EPA,
state agencies, and other concerned parties.
Workshop on Emission Imrentorles and Assessments. CMA has
developed a two-day workshop to provide emissions inventory and
assessments information that will assist member companies in the
implementation of an Air Toxics Control Program. The workshop, held
on January 13-14, 1987, highlights included:
o
o
o
o
o
o
emission inventory techniques,
updated fugitive emissions procedures,
notification and reporting requirements,
modeling for accidental releases,
screening methodologies, and
modeling for routine releases.
An EPA spokesman will address EPA's publication, "Implementing the EPA
Air Toxics Policy", and D. E. Wenger of the University of Delaware
Disaster Research Center will address "Human Response During Crisis".
Communications Workshop - Air Toxics Control Policy. CMA has
developed a workshop in response to many member companies requests for
assistance in how to communicate air toxics issues. The workshop,
held on January 20, 1987, addressed risk issues and how to build on
existing CAER networks. The workshop used a "hands-on” approach with
individual participants working through the steps needed to develop
communications messages and action plans for their own facilities.
State Accidental Release Prevention and Control Issue Analysis.
The Environmental Management Committee has developed, for use by the
State Affairs Committee, an Issue Analysis on Accidental Release
prevention and control. The document develops guidance that is
consistent with existing CMA policy that is readily usable by CMA
member companies in state activities. The objective is to obtain
relatively uniform and rational state and local regulations that
upgrade control of all sources handling significant quantities of
highly toxic materials without penalizing sources already performing
to good industry practices.
3. Grassroots Activities
Congressional Liaison Representatives (CLRs) are establishing
district coalitions of chemical company representatives and other
parties with an interest in air toxics legislation. These coalitions
are meeting to review the issue and tailor a specific message around
19
CMA 038761
CMA general principles on air toxics. Meetings between the coalitions
and key legislators will be held during the spring and summer to
educate legislators on industry operations and CMA's positions.
Members of Congress have been identified as key members on air
toxics on the basis of membership on the congressional committees of
jurisdiction as well as a large industry constituent presence in their
districts. The list of members so identified for activity in the
Grassroots Program will be reviewed as new congressional committee
assignments are made, and revised, accordingly.
4. Regulatory Developments and Response
Industrial Boilers New Source Performance Standards. CMA
submitted comments on EPA's proposed standards of performance for new
stationary sources, lndustrial-commcrcial-institutional steam
generating units. CMA criticized the 90% reduction requirement as
neither practical nor cost effective for small boilers. CMA
recommended that the Agency set emission limits that can be met by
either fuel election, pre-cleaning, or scrubbing whichever is most
cost effective.
In addition, CMA noted that the proposed NSPS is inconsistent
with other important national goals.
In this regard, it contradicts
U.S. energy policy by discouraging the use of coal, our most abundant
energy resource. Additionally, the effects of the proposed regulation
could run counter to the intent of the Clean Air Act in reducing
emissions. The unrealistic requirement for SO. emission reductions
could encourage continued operation of existing, less efficient
boilers. CMA urged EPA to reconsider its proposal and issue a less
onerous standard which would not deter the use of coal and would be
cost effective.
5. Litigation and Related Activities
Vinvl Chloride Litigation. CMA won a major victory in a case
involving Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The decision provides EPA
with more discretion in setting reasonable clean air standards. CMA
participated in this esse, supporting EPA's position that the Agency
can consider cost and technological feasibility in setting emission
standards.
The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) argued that Section
112 permits only the consideration of health-based factors.
Therefore, in their view, EPA could not take into account cost and
technological feasibility.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, however, held
that EPA has some discretion in setting emission standards.
Its
November 4, 1986, decision affirmed that EPA had acted reasonably in
withdrawing proposed amendments on vinyl chloride after considering
the cost to industry and the technological feasibility of compliance.
20
CMA 038762
NRDC has asked for a rehearing of the case.
If the decision is
upheld, it is expected to affect similar litigation involving benzene
and radionuclides standards.
Benzene and Radionuclides Litigation. On November 20, 1986,
CMA filed supplemental briefs in the benzene and the radionuclides
litigation with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The
briefs were requested by the court to help assess the impact of the
recent vinyl chloride decision on these two cases. Both involve an
issue similar to that in the vinyl chloride case: whether EPA may
consider cost and technological feasibility in setting emission
standards. Oral argument has been scheduled for May 26, 1987.
6. Communications
Communications Department is producing an issues book for the Ad
Hoc Accidental Release Prevention and Control Group. Distribution is
targeted for mid-January. The book will describe legislative and
regulatory issues focused on prevention and control of accidental
releases from chemical facilities.
A seminar on air toxics policy communication was conducted for an
expected 150 attendees in Houston. The seminar targeted for plant
managers, was designed to assist those attending develop site specific
communication plans.
With the support of the Communications Committee and CMA's
communications staff, the Louisiana Chemical Association is developing
plans to implement an air toxics communication plan. Their experience
will be shared with other state organizations.
Chemical Product Distribution Advocacy
1. Congressional Developments and Response
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.
The Hazardous
Materials Transportation Act (HMTA) was scheduled to be considered for
reauthorization in the 99th Congress. With the exception of one day
of hearings before a subcommittee, no action was taken on the matter.
Funding to continue the activities which the Act regulates was
included in the continuing resolution which Congress passed just prior
to adjournment. As the Act contains no sunset provisions, officials
at the Department of Transportation are satisfied that, for the time
being, this congressional action was sufficient to maintain the
programs covered by the Act.
Nevertheless, it is anticipated that there are a number of
Congressmen who would like to see the Act reopened for additional
amendments. Accordingly, extensive activity on HMTA is expected in
the 100th Congress.
CMA plans to take the position paper approved by the Board last
January and draft proposed legislative language which could be used
for the Act's reauthorization. The Government Relations Committee’s
21
CMA 038763
Transportation Task Group will visit key Congressmen during the first
part of the year seeking sponsors for CMA's suggested revisions to the
existing law.
Driver Licensing. The Drug Bill which passed the Congress at
the end of the last session included provisions dealing with the
commercial licensing of truck drivers. Currently, there are no
national standards. The new law would still allow drivers to be
licensed by individual states, but will establish a system which will
not allow multiple state licenses as is now the case. The new
standards must be in effect by 1992. CMA has been in favor of
requirements which would require only a single commercial license for
drivers.
Incident Reporting.
In the closing days of the last Congress,
a law was enacted to reauthorize Superfund. Under the right-to-know
provisions of Title III of the law reauthorizing Superfund, some
additional requirements have been added on the reporting of spills of
hazardous materials.
In addition to the current requirements that
incidents must be reported to the National Response Center, the
incident must now also be reported to the local emergency responder.
Requests for comments on proposed rule-making in this area are
currently being solicited and CMA plans to file comments.
2. Regulatory Developments and Response
Shipping Act Review. The Federal Maritime Administration, with
CMA's cooperation, has begun to receive input from chemical shippers
on the favorable, as well as unfavorable, aspects of the Shipping Act
of 1984. The Distribution Committee has prioritized its advocacy
plans. High priority items include: prohibit ocean carrier
conferences; deregulate authority over service contracts; continue
mandatory right of independent action; and, prohibit cargo reservation
bilaterals.
MARPOL Annex II. CMA filed comments with the U.S. Coast Guard
on its proposed rules implementing the MARPOL Annex II provisions for
the international bulk, shipment of chemicals by vessels. Much of the
CMA comments focused on the procedures for cleaning cargo ships and
disposal of residue.
MARPOL Annex III. CMA provided the U.S. Coast Guard with
technical comments on a position paper the Coast Guard plans to
introduce before the UN International Maritime Organization. The
paper focuses on the expansion of the international requirements for
packaged chemical shipments to additional classes of materials. CMA
convinced Coast Guard to modify its position paper.
District of Columbia Hazardous Materials Study Commission. CMA
is represented on a special commission established by the District of
Columbia to assess the potential risks posed by the transportation of
hazardous materials, and to form the District's policies towards
controlling these risks.
22
Tank Car Allowance System. CMA joined with other tank car
providers in submitting comments to the Interstate Commerce Commission
in reply to the railroad's petition for clarification on the tank car
allowance system. CMA supported the Commission's interpretation of
how the rules should be applied. CMA noted that the parties to the
negotiated agreement, which was subsequently adopted by the
Commission, decided to leave for future resolution the evidence that
would be relevant in the investigation of a departure from the
national tank car allowance system.
Railroad Cost Recovery Procedures. The Supreme Court has
denied the railroad's last ditch effort to obtain a stay of the ICC's
decision served October 17 in Ex Parte 290 (Sub. No. 2), railroad cost
recovery procedures. CMA had already filed a reply with the
Commission opposing the railroad's request for a stay. The effeet of
the cancellation will be to roll back set recovery based rates to the
December, 1985, level.
Peru Cargo Reservation. CMA sent comments to the Federal
Maritime Commission urging them to seek an injunction of the equal
access agreements regarding U.S./Peru trade. CMA noted that such
agreements would institutionalize cargo reservation in the U.S./Peru
trade, and would subsequently pose severe limitations on the
competitive service of third-flag carriers that have previously been
offering the most frequent and reliable service.
Brazil Bilateral. CMA sent a letter to the Department of
Transportation urging nonrenewal of the U.S./Brazilian bilateral
agreement on cargo reservation. The bilateral condones Brazil's cargo
reservation laws which require U.S. exporters to ship approximately 90
percent of their tonnage on U.S. or Brazilian flag vessels. CMA noted
that U.S. chemical exporters/shippers arc seriously hampered by these
requirements. Notwithstanding CMA's urging, the U.S. signed a threeyear agreement that would continue cargo reservation in the trade.
One bright spot is that the agreement does not condone the reservation
of bulk cargo.
Hazardous Substances. CMA furnished the Department of
Transportation with comments outlining problems the chemical industry
will have in trying to comply with the provisions of the Superfund
Amendments and Reauthorization Act calling for the regulation of
hazardous substances for transportation.
3. Policy Development, Analytical and Program Activities
Transportation Risk Management. Work is continuing on the
development of a chemical transportation risk management system.
Individual company programs are being analyzed for generic features
that can be used industrywide to further safeguard against the
accidental release of chemicals. CMA and the Association of American
Railroads have jointly reviewed several systems with the intent to
develop a rail chemical transportation risk management model.
Individual shippers and carriers could use this model to assess the
relative risk of various routes and containers.
23
CMA 038765
Warehouse Safety Program. The Distribution and Health and
Safety Committees have formed a joint working group to develop a
program to enhance the safe storage of chemicals in warehouses. This
group has reviewed several existing chemical company programs, and is
now developing a general package that companies can use when reviewing
the safety programs of individual warehouses.
Distribution Outreach Activities. The Distribution Committee's
Outreach Task Group is currently revising the CMA publication
"Transporting Chemicals Safely." This will be used as part of the
Committee's efforts to communicate the positive steps the chemical
industry has taken to reduce the probability of an accidental release
during transportation.
Expansion of the CAER Program to Transportation. The
Distribution Committee and the Health and Safety Committee have joined
forces to promote the expansion of the Community Awareness and
Emergency Response program to the transportation community. Local
communities that are exposed to the transportation of chemicals should
have emergency response contingency plans in place. CMA is working
with representatives of the trucking industry to reach these
communities with the CAER program.
National Chemical Response and Information Center (NCRIC)
1. CHEMTREC
CHEMTREC ended 1986 with a record number of calls -- for the
first time, emergency reports received exceeded 4,000 (4,239 actual)
in a year's time. Over 1985, call volume increased 23%; included in
this increase was a surge in medical emergencies and other
nontransportation emergencies and a modest increase in transportation
emergencies.
CHEMTREC now has two communicators on duty from 7:30 a.m.11:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. To accommodate this change,
CHEMTREC adopted a 42-day shift rotation work schedule versus the
28-day rotation in use since 1971. The new shift schedule offers
several distinct advantages, namely, fewer night shifts to work (8
versus 13), and a doubling of weekends off (25 versus 12). The new
schedule should go a long way toward reducing job-related stress and
increase morale.
A total of 1,947 chemical records are now loaded in the chemical
database. There are now 238 generic guides for the CHEMTREC Emergency
Response Guide library.
CHEMTREC has provided CAER with its requirements for
participating in community-wide emergency drills for hazardous
materials, and has been involved in two CAER-related drills.
Interest in the Hazard Information Transmission (HIT) program
continues apace. Since the last report, there have been 128 inquiries
about the program (HIT brochures have been mailed, to each). Currently
24
CMA 038766
there are 84 active participants located in 26 states, and 30
applicants being processed.
The Salvage Drum Cooperative program has 156 members as of
November, 1986, with drum locations in 47 states, 2 Canadian
territories, and Puerto Rico. The program is currently being updated
and a new printing will be issued in February, 1987.
In December, CHEMTREC responded to three incidents involving
either foreign producers or shippers. On December 14, the Suffren,
New York Fire Department was called to an apparent fire in a Japanese
restaurant.
It turned out that a fumigant was being used to kill
insects. Firefighters were exposed to the fumes. Label markings on
the container were in Japanese with the only clue in English being the
word "Chugai" which, it turns out, means "bug". An overseas call to
the Japanese producer did not yield results, but the manufacturer's
phone number was passed to the fire department for product
identification at a later time.
2. CHEMNET
The CHEMNET program now has 79 members, 39 participants and 40
subscribers. Vhen subsidiaries of members are included, companies
covered by the program total 122.
The CHEMTREC/CHEMNET Work Group is now in the process of
reviewing membership applications from for-hire contractors. Four
applications have been recommended to the group. The selection
process should be completed by the end of January.
3. Chemical Referral Center
Working from a computer database that now contains product
profiles on 103,000 chemicals, the Chemical Referral Center (CRC)
continues to assist approximately 900 callers per month. Between
December, 1985, and December, 1986, the CRC responded to over 11,800
requests from the general public for nonemergency health and safety
information on chemicals.
The CRC staff have been working on a report describing the
Center's activities during its first year of operation. This document
will be distributed to the 280 chemical companies currently
participating in the CRC.
Emergency Response Training
Lending Library. In fifteen months of operation the Lending
Library has loaned more than 2,400 training programs to emergency
response personnel in the public sector. These programs have been
shown to more than 128,000 emergency responders. There are fourteen
programs in the library and we have identified several new programs
that will be added.
25
CMA 038767
First Responder Training Programs. The most popular training
program in the library is still "First on the Scene," the first
responder training videotape produced by CMA. More than a thousand
copies have been borrowed from the library and over 3,200 copies have
been distributed free or sold at the cost of reproducing the tape.
The Canadian Center for Occupational Safety and Health is planning to
convert the tape into French and distribute it in Canada.
The new videotape training program, "Teamwork -- Safe Handling of
a Hazardous Materials Incident" should be ready for distribution at
the end of January. This program stresses the need for preplanning;
establishing who is in charge and the various roles of the responders;
identifying sources of assistance, and how to activate them; the need
to work with the media and the importance of a post-incident
critique. These points are demonstrated in a scenario involving an
overturned tank truck that is leaking a flammable poisonous material.
The scenario takes you through each phase of the incident from the
time it happened through cleanup and the critique. It will be an
excellent sequel to "First on the Scene."
The second Standard Phraseology Manual, on all types of
packagings used to transport chemicals, is in the final review
process. The manual should be available for distribution in the
Spring of 1987.
K. International Regulatory Issues (Health. Safety and Environment^
1. International Organizations
United Nations. CMA staff met recently with Dr. Noel Brown,
Director of the New York office of the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP). Early next year UNEP will propose three
international conventions aimed at avoiding chemical accidents (such
as the recent Rhein incident) and improving hazard communication to
the public. Mr. Roland has communicated with Dr. Mostafa Tolba,
Executive Director of UNEP, outlining CMA's CAER program and CMA's
expertise in crafting workable community awareness programs.
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The International Affairs Group (IAG) has been working with the U.S.
Council for International Business/Business and Industry Advisory
Committee to the OECD (USCIB/BIAC) in preparing comments on agenda
items for the March, 1987, OECD Third High Level Meeting. The Meeting
will include ministerial level participants (e.g., EPA Administrator
Lee Thomas) and will focus on regulatory programs for existing
chemicals, chemical risk management and risk assessment. The IAG will
provide additional comments on the High Level Meeting documents in
January.
2. International Regulations
Labeling. The U.S. Trade Representative will host the second
bilateral technical discussions between the Commission of the European
Community and the U.S. Government January 20-21 in Washington. The
26
discussions will be on the proposed European Community (EC) General
Preparations Directive (GPD). CMA has prepared comments for the IAG,
supplementing CMA's objections to the GPD voiced in January, 1986.
The additional comments highlight industry's continuing problems with
the restrictive labeling requirements of the GPD.
The joint IAG, Canadian Chemical Producers Association (CCPA),
and European Council of Chemical Manufacturers Federations (CEFIC)
paper on The Identification and Classification of Carcinogens,
Mutagens and Teratogens will be published in the March, 1987, issue of
Regulatory Pharmacology and Toxicology. The criteria paper is
gaining international acceptance as the appropriate methodology for
classification of potential health hazards. The revised ANSI labeling
standard, now being updated by CMA's Health and Safety Committee, will
contain the criteria paper as an appendix.
Inventory. CMA recently prepared for IAG submission a letter
to the U.S. Department of State reiterating industry's problems with
the United Nations so-called "Consolidated List" of banned or severely
restricted chemical substances. The list compiles regulatory
information and commercial data on specific chemicals, and has been
shown to contain significant errors. The mistakes may well result in
the boycott of the products of U.S. firms. The letter urged the
Department of State to ensure that the criteria for identifying
chemicals to be included on the List is consistently and accurately
applied.
International Trade/International Competitiveness
1. Congressional Developments and Response
Omnibus Trade Law. Leaders of both Houses of Congress say
that a trade bill will be ready for the President's signature by May,
1987. That may be a very ambitious goal. Extensive hearings were
held in the House of Representatives during the last Congress,
producing an equally extensive trade bill (H.R. 4800) which the
Administration promised to veto. While the hearings on the Senate
side were also numerous, the Finance Committee failed to report a
bill. The Finance Committee, of course, has a new look in the current
Congress with control of the Senate back to the Democratic Party.
Senator Bentsen plans to introduce a bill which is unlikely to be
either like the bill considered previously by the Senate (S. 1860) or
Over the last year, CMA's International Trade Committee (ITC) has
been providing the Board of Directors with suggested positions on
needed modifications to a number of elements of existing trade law.
Consequently, CMA is in an excellent position to react to legislative
overtures on any proposal for a new omnibus trade bill.
CMA is continuing its lobbying efforts on trade matters through
the Covemment Relations Committee'a Trade Task Group and through the
coalition known as the Office of the Chemical Industry Trade Advisor
(0CITA). OCITA's primary focus is on assuring that any new trade
27
CMA 038769
legislation contains language which would exempt import sensitive
items from tariff reduction considerations.
In addition to the failure of the previous Congress to pass any
omnibus trade bill, it also failed to give final passage to the
numerous miscellaneous trade and tariff measures which provide for
temporary reductions or suspensions of duty on specified items.
SOCMA, also a member of OCITA, is attempting to have legislation
introduced which would allow for temporary duty suspension matters to
proceed administratively. The ITC is currently examining this issue
to determine whether to recommend that the CMA endorse the SOCMA
initiative.
2. International Negotiations/Agreements
Tariff Negotiations. The next round of multilateral trade
n gotiations (MTN) which will be known as the Uruguay Round, has
g tten underway. When the Ministers of the General Agreement on Trade
and Tariffs (GATT) met in Uruguay in September, 1986, they agreed with
great difficulty on an agenda for the negotiations. The last MTN,
known as the Tokyo Round, resulted in staged reductions of tariffs
which concluded with the last reduction occurring on January 1, 1987.
While there is no certainty on how long the negotiations will
continue, the United States is hopeful that some agreements can be
reached within the next few years.
The possibility of such a rapid agreement may be optimistic.
Traditionally, MTN rounds have been extremely lengthy processes.
Because of the protracted nature of the discussions, CMA members face
the danger of losing interest in a process which will profoundly
affect their daily operations. The International Trade Committee
(ITC) is fully committed to keeping industry activity at an
appropriate level.
CMA has already hosted a seminar to inform its members of both
the process of the negotiations and the expected agendas that the
major GATT participants will bring to the discussions. The CMA ITC is
currently contemplating the formation of a list of chemicals that the
govememnt should investigate to determine the product's degree of
import sensitivity.
In addition, a list of objectives sought by the
industry is also being considered. Both activities are in response to
overtures made to the industry by the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative and the Department of Conanerce.
3. Legal
Pre-Shipment Inspection and Customs Valuation Procedures
Conducted by Private Companies on Behalf of Foreign Governments. In
September, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) reviewed
a Section 301 trade remedy petition filed by representatives of U.S.
industry. This petition contested the quality, quantity, and price
inspections conducted in the United States by private pre-shipment
inspection companies that act as agents for governments of
twenty-three developing countries.
28
CMA 038770
Inspection companies have been known arbitrarily to reject a U.S.
exporter's price and change the value of the goods for Customs
purposes in the importing country before clearing them for shipment.
Moreover, in conducting their product and price comparisons, the
inspection companies request confidential business information from
exporters, often with inadequate assurances for protection from
disclosure. Many U.S. exporters, including U.S. chemical companies
(the majority of negative comments received by USTR on this subject
came from U.S. chemical and pharmaceutical companies), are having
difficulty meeting contractual delivery requirements in countries
which require such pre-shipment clearance, and financial settlements
are being delayed. These practices also arguably violate a number of
international agreements.
In late October, USTR decided not to initiate a formal Section
301 trade investigation.
Instead, it is negotiating bilaterally with
each of the twenty-three governments involved on an expedited basis.
In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) has
initiated a study on the impact of these pre-shipment inspection
companies on U.S. industry trade. As part of this study,
questionnaires are being sent to U.S. companies, including CMA member
companies. It is important that these questionnaires be filled out
and returned, so that the USITC can have an accurate reading of the
burdens put on industry by these pre-shipment practices. CMA is
working in an informal industry coalition to ensure that the chemical
industry's concerns are addressed in the USTR negotiations and USITC
study.
4. Communieations
The department coordinated activities for CMA's annual economic
news briefing, including development of materials for the briefing,
collateral distribution of the briefing materials and arrangements for
one-on-one interviews with key CMA staff.
Taxation
1. Congressional Developments and Response
The size, complexity and mistakes of the 1986 Tax Reform Act are
strong reasons to believe Congress will again consider major tax
legislation in 1987.
In addition, many related legislative areas
(such as trade legislation) which are high on the 1987 Congressional
agenda may contain important tax provisions, for example, changes in
foreign tax treatment. For these reasons CMA again anticipates
substantial regulatory and legislative tax activity in the coming year.
The Tax Policy Committee has established a Tax Reform
Implementation Task Group to identify legislative and regulatory
Issues arising from the 1986 legislation. The Task Group has divided
its assignments among five working groups that are now developing
written materials on specific subject areas. The Tax Policy Committee
and the Government Relations Committee will develop a comprehensive
tax legislative work plan as more detail of the Congressional agenda
29
CMA 038771
unfolds. Although the 100th Congress will not convene until
mid-January, the CMA tax program for the new year Is well underway.
Patents and Protection of Technology
1. Congress
Patent Term Restoration.
Patent Term Restoration (PTR)
legislation was amended to the reauthorization of the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) which failed to be
accepted by the Senate in the final days of the 99th Congress. The
agrichemicals industry became involved in negotiating changes to FIFRA
largely because a group of environmentalists objected to PTR
legislation in the 98th Congress. The environmentalists lobbied
Congress and said that so long as the industry refused to cooperate in
a rewrite of FIFRA, the environmental groups would actively oppose any
legislation to extend the patents on pesticides.
In September, 1986, the House passed FIFRA, and Patent Term
Restoration was reported out of the House Judiciary Subcommittee and
the full Committee.
In contrast to the opposition in the 98th
Congress, PTR moved through the subcommittee and the full committee
without a single Member speaking in opposition to the measure.
In
early October, 1986, the House passed PTR and again, no one spoke in
opposition to PTR.
In addition, the FIFRA package was amended to
PTR. The House passed FIFRA and PTR again in a different form and
sent it back to the Senate where it eventually died.
It is expected that PTR legislation will be introduced early in
the 100th Congress. Based on information from House Judiciary
Subcommittee staff, it is likely that the Subcommittee will move
expeditiously to report out PTR legislation. In the Senate, with the
retirement of Senator Mathias (R-MD), it is not yet certain who will
be the lead person on this issue. CMA will continue to work with the
industry coalition and play a supportive role to the National
Agricultural Chemicals Association's efforts on this issue. The
prospects for passage of PTR in 1987 will hinge on the satisfactory,
resolution of conflicts among the industry, consumer/environmental
groups and the generic producers on amendments to FIFRA.
Process Patent Legislation. This legislation would have
expanded the definition of patent infringement to cover importation
into the United States and use and sale in this country of products
made abroad by processes patented in the U.S. Two versions of this
legislation passed the House and one version passed the Senate during
the final days of the 99th Congress. Negotiations continued until the
day Congress adjourned without final approval.
The industry coalition which had been involved in negotiating the
compromise legislation in the last Congress will be active on this
issue in the 100th Congress. The group is looking to Senator Frank R.
Lautenberg (D-NJ) to revive this issue, hopefully early in the new
session. CMA will continue to support prompt passage of process
patent protection legislation. The current evasion of our patent law
30
CMA 038772
is costly, not only in actual revenue lost but also to the number of
U.S. jobs that are actually lost to foreign manufacturers.
Liability Reform and Insurance
1. Congressional Developments and Response
The product liability reform legislation was passed out of the
Senate Commerce Committee and considered on the Senate floor in the
99th Congress.
It did not pass the Senate nor was it considered in
the House.
The 100th Congress has the Democrats in control of the House and
the Senate which will change the agenda for the product liability
issue.
Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC) will now be the chairman of the
Commerce Connittee. Hollings has long been a strong opponent of far
reaching Federal product liability legislation. Thus, we will have to
wait and see what his agenda will be for the Coasserce Committee. On
the House side the ad hoc bi-partisan product liability study group is
looking at the issue and may make legislative recommendations.
State Legislative and Regulatory Advocacy
1. Liability Reform, Insurance and Public Compensation
Approximately 35 states passed some tort reform legislation in
1986. Many of these laws dealt with single areas, such as day-care
centers or municipal liability. Only a few states, such as Colorado,
Connecticut, Washington and Florida, passed comprehensive reform
bills. The issues that saw the most activity in 1986 were:
- modification or elimination of joint and several liability
- caps on non-economic damages
- collateral source rules to deal with the problem of double
payments.
In most cases the chemical industry has shared in the benefits of
general tort reform. However, injuries involving hazardous substances
were partially or, in some cases, completely excluded from some of the
significant reforms, particularly the limitation on joint and several
liability.
The American Legislative Exchange Council, a national
organization of approximately 2000 conservative state legislators,
adopted proposed legislative language on tort reform issues for
inclusion in the recently published "Source Book of American State
Legislation, 1987-88." CMA's tort reform issues resource book was
utilized in the development of this language.
The continued concern over insurance availability is likely to
generate significant activity in 1987.
31
CMA 038773
2. Hazardous Vasts Management and Regulation
At the December meeting of the Council of State Governments (CSG)
Subcommittee on Suggested State Legislation, the New Jersey
Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act (ECRA) was again considered
as a possible model for other states. This law seriously limits the
transfer of property until site contamination studies and cleanup have
been completed.
CMA's State Affairs Special ECRA Work Group is managing this
issue in conjunction with the New Jersey CIC. The CIC has been
working directly with state officials to amend the law. As a result
primarily of the CIC's work, CSG subcommittee voted in December to
defer consideration until the state of New Jersey verifies the needed
changes. These changes will reportedly occur in the first half of
1987 and probably in time for the final vote by CSG on model
legislation during their summer meeting. Some form of an ECRA law
will more than likely be considered at that meeting.
3. Right-to-Know
The decision in the lawsuit brought by Pennsylvania
manufacturers regarding the application of the state's right-to-know
law has been appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Under a
lower court decision issued at the end of 1986, chemical manufacturers
could be required to prepare separate labels and MSDS's for their
products shipped into or used in Pennsylvania. The industry's appeal
to the Supreme Court seeks to uphold and clarify the preemption of the
OSHA Hazard Communication Standard over state right-to-know lsw3. An
injunction against the implementation of the state law, as it applies
to manufacturers, is in effect until the court decides whether or not
it will accept the case.
4. Chemical Plant Safety
A top priority for the new Chemical Safety Task Group is to
address state legislation that would regulate chemical plant
processes. Several states considered laws in 1986 and New Jersey
enacted a comprehensive statute which requires risk assessments and
risk management plans for certain facilities. An issues analysis
document has been developed by a combined State Affairs/EMC work group
and will be distributed to member company state affairs contacts and
state CIC's in January.
The new task group is also working with the CAER Task Group to
promote the CAER program as a method for states to implement the
emergency response requirements of Title III of the new Superfund Law.
5. Groundwater
The California Initiative on Safe Drinking Water and Toxics
Enforcement Act of 1986 passed by the voters in November by a margin
of 63 to 37, or roughly 2 to 1. Early in the summer, the odds were as
high as 10 to 1 in favor of the Proposition.
So the public relations
32
CMA 038774
program> developed and implemented by the industry coalition, had a
significant impact on the public's perception of this issue, however,
it obviously was not enough to change the outcome. There are some who
believe that if the PR program had been started sooner, i.e., funding
obtained earlier, our chances for success would have been greater.
Proposition 65 is now in the hands of the administration and the
legislature. The first major implementation date is March 1, 1987,
when the Governor must publish a list of effected chemicals. A year
later, on March 1, 1988, the warning provisions go into effect and on
November 1, 1989 the discharge prohibitions become effective.
The industry coalition will continue to work with the
administration to implement the law with as little damage to the
California's economy as possible. Hopefully, it will be able to work
with the legislature to cleanup some of the provisions in the
initiative. A thorough legal evaluation resulted in the decision not
to litigate at this time. While there were some potential
constitutional grounds for challenging the new law, it was the
consensus of the coalition's steering committee and legal counsel that
better opportunities for litigation would occur during the
implementation of the law.
Meanwhile, many environmental groups are seeking to take the lead
in implementing Proposition 65. There are even classified ads in the
California newspapers recruiting "bounty hunters".
In fact, the
bounty hunter provision may be used as a membership enticement for
environmental groups.
The CMA State Affairs Committee has appointed a special ad hoc
group to develop the chemical industry's recommended advocacy approach
to this issue, not only in California, but to the other states where
it may spread.
6. Toxic Air
The State Affairs Air Toxics Task Group is working with the State
and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators (STAPPA) to
educate them on the industry's programs and positions on air toxics
regulations.
Industry technical support for advocacy programs at the
state level is being enhanced and the "Air Toxics Resource Handbook"
is being made available to state agencies as an information source.
Development and implementation of state air toxics programs is being
monitored in Florida. Kentucky. Maryland. Massachusetts. North
Carolina. South Carolina. Texas and Wisconsin.
Energy and Petrochemical Feedstocks
. 1. Litigation and Related Legal Activities
FERC Notice of Inquiry. CMA has submitted written comments in
response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Notice of
Inquiry on interstate pipeline marketing affiliates. The comments
33
CMA 038775
I
express support for the Commission's goal of ensuring competition in
the natural gas marketing/brokering function. Such competition will
benefit all natural gas users by lowering gas prices, while providing
efficient allocation of available gas supplies and pipeline capacity.
In order to protect competition in the marketing function, CMA stated,
the Commission must prevent interstate pipelines from shifting their
market power to an unregulated affiliate. CMA called on the
Commission to promulgate new, but limited, regulations to facilitate
competition in natural gas marketing.
R. Specific Chemical Research and Advocacy
1. Research and Advocacy Highlights
Biocides. On November 26, 1986, EPA proposed rules in the
Federal Register (51:429741 for the imposition of fees for various
pesticide registration activities. Because the costs associated with
this proposal are substantial for the entire pesticides industry, the
Biocides Panel is preparing comments on the proposed rule. A liaison
has been established with the National Agricultural Chemical
Association to coordinate comments between NACA and CMA.
Butadiene. The Panel is preparing comments in response to the
OSHA Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning worker exposure
to 1,3-butadiene (51 FR 35003), As part of the comments, the Panel
has requested assistance from three contractors in the following
areas: risk assessment of butadiene economic analysis of butadiene
production, and emission/exposure due to butadiene manufacturing. The
comments will be presented to OSHA by January 19, 1987.
Butvlated Hvdroxvtoluene. The BHT Panel filed a Citizen
Petition with the Food and Drug Administration requesting the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs to issue a regulation recognizing a
prior sanction for the use of BHT as a direct and indirect food
additive. The major purpose of the Petition is to work with the
Agency in developing a process by which the FDA evaluates the safety
of BHT in light of all experimental studies. Another purpose is to
request FDA to establish a common regulatory status for all
food-related uses of BHT. The use of BHT as an antioxidant in food
currently is subject to a complex regulatory scheme.
Chlorobenzenes. A joint petition filed by the Chlorobenzenes
Program Panel and the SOCMA Chlorobenzenes Producers Association, U.S.
producers of ortho- and para-dichlorobenzene requested that EPA
withdraw the requirement for reproductive and fertility effects
testing mandated in a TSCA Section 4(a) test rule. The petition
reflects EPA and industry consensus on the significance of available
data on the potential for dichlorobenzenes to cause reproductive
effects. Scientific consensus was reached prior to issuance of the
test rule.
In essence, there was agreement that a negative
reproductive effects study on monochlorobenzene, combined with
existing negative data on 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, would eliminate
concern for potential reproductive effects of the dichlorobenzenes.
The Petition was accompanied by a Panel-sponsored reproductive effects
34
CMA 038776
study on monochlorobenzene that failed to demonstrate significant
adverse reproductive effects.
Producers of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene are preparing to initiate
oncogenicity studies in rats and mice. The testing is required by CPA
under a TSCA Section 4(a) test rule. Preliminary palatibility and
subchronic studies will be conducted in both species in order to set
dose levels in the two-year bioassays.
The Panel has requested that CPA reconsider the need for soil
adsorption studies on dichlorobenzenes and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene.
A
recent report of a study containing data of the type required in the
test rule was submitted to EPA with the request. The study was
conducted for the EPA OTS Health and Environmental Review Division
under an interagency agreement with the Department of Energy.
Cresols. The Panel has made final laboratory selections for
research that will be conducted under a TSCA Section 4(a) Final Test
Rule. Hazleton Laboratories, Inc. will conduct mutagenicity studies
and Bushy Run Research Center will conduct reproductive and
developmental effects studies. Research will begin when the final
testing guidelines are issued by EPA.
Ethylene Oxide. The EOIC is preparing to send an EO workplace
survey to all EO producers and ethoxylators. The results of the
survey will be used to support comments to OSHA on the short term
exposure limit (STEL) issue. The Council feels that the lppm PEL
(long-term standard) has been effective in reducing exposure and a
STEL (short-term standard) may not be necessary. The OSHA ethylene
oxide STEL is to be proposed by March 1987, with comments due sixty
days thereafter.
2-Ethvlhexanolc Acid. CMA filed a petition for judicial review
of EPA's finding that EHA "may present an unreasonable risk" within
the context of TSCA's testing provisions. The Panel will argue that
EPA's testing requirements are not supported by "substantial
evidence.” CMA is also seeking a stay of the EPA testing requirements
pending completion of judicial review proceedings.
2-Ethvlhexanol. The producers, importers and users of 2-EH
formed a new panel to interact with EPA in the development of a test
rule. Test rule activity was initiated by EPA in August 1986. A
proposed rule to initiate a bioassay was planned for publication by
January 1987, with a final rule by June 1987. Once the bio**say was
underway, EPA planned to propose a second test rule to cover any other
testing that might be needed. 2-EH, originally the subject of an
NTP-sponsored chronic bioassay, came to EPA's attention when budget
cuts forced NTP to drop the bioassay from its program. As a result,
the Agency decided to use the TSCA Section 4 provisions to require
industry to conduct the test. The Panel entered into negotiations
with EPA to attempt a test program under the newly developed consent
agreement procedure rather than formal rulemaking. Although EPA and
NTP agreed with the Panel's concept of a collaborative research
program, negotiations broke down over disagreements on the chemicals
35
CMA 038777
to be tested, the route of administration, and the importance of
understanding the mechanism of carcinogenicity. A proposed rule was
published in the Federal Register on December 19, 1986.
Glycol Ethers. The Glycol Ethers Panel will sponsor
mutagenicity tests on diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (DGBE) at
Dow's Lake Jackson Research Center. DGBE will be evaluated in the
mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and in an in vitro mutation
assay (CHO/HGPRT). These tests have been proposed by EPA in a TSCA
Section 4(a) test rule.
Plans to initiate a voluntary testing program on the triethylene
glycol ethers have been postponed. EPA informed the Panel that, due
to a more severe economic impact of the proposed test rule than
originally anticipated, the Agency is reconsidering testing needs for
these glycol ethers. Furthermore, EPA is developing a "generic"
glycol ethers test rule and it is possible that the triethylene glycol
ethers will be included. The generic rule is scheduled to issue this
summer. A Panel meeting with EPA is anticipated in February.
In a Federal Register notice published on December 11, 1986, OSHA
responded to EPA's TSCA Section 9(a) referral of 2-methoxyethanol,
2-ethoxyethanol and their acetates. OSHA preliminarily concluded that
occupational exposures at the current permissible exposure limits may
present a significant health risk and that adoption of a revised
occupational standard is economically and technologically feasible.
OSHA did not indicate when it plans to initiate rulemaking.
Hvdroquinone. Panel representatives met with EPA on December
15 to discuss the interim rule on Extremely Hazardous Substances and
Threshold Planning Quantity under Superfund amendments. CMA
recommended that hydroquinone be deleted from the listing of acutely
toxic chemicals because the relevant animal effects data do not
satisfy the proposed listing criteria.
Isopropanol. In response to the 19th Interagency Testing
Committee Report designating isopropanol for health effects studies
under Section 4(a) of TSCA, producers met with CMA and have decided to
form a Special Program Panel. The Panel's initial activity will
center on the development of a testing program to respond to ITC's
concerns and to work with the EPA on a negotiated testing consent
agreement.
Ketones. Mesityl oxide producers took steps to include
supplemental material in the administrative record before the Fifth
Circuit Court.
In December, the motion to supplement was denied.
This means that judicial review of the EPA mesityl oxide test rule
will proceed on the pre-petition record in the Fifth Circuit and will
not include information supportive of the producers' TSCA Section 21
Petition for withdrawal of the rule. The opening brief will be filed
in January.
An EPA move to stay U.S. District Court proceedings challenging
EPA's denial of the Section 21 petition was granted. Having received
a final denial of supplementation in the Fifth Circuit, the mesityl
oxide producers are seeking to vacate the stay.
The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) moved to intervene
in the Fifth Circuit and the petition was granted. The American
Petroleum Institute will file an amicus curiae brief.
Lubricant Additives. Hazard profiles developed by the Group of
Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution (GESAMP) were
used as the basis for categorization of classes of lubricant
additives. The Bulk Chemical Handling (BCH) Subcommittee of IMO
placed most of the additives in a provisional category "B"; zinc
dithiophosphates were placed in category "A". Concerns with the
protocol design of aquatic toxicity studies conducted by the Panel
appear to be the basis of the provisional classifications. The zinc
classification resulted from concern with bioccumulation. The Panel
is awaiting clarification from GESAMP before proceeding to address
these Issues.
The Panel has provided tank stripping data to the U.S. Coast
Guard that demonstrates efficient stripping of vessels carrying
viscous additives. These data will be presented to the BCH
Subcommittee via CEFIC as evidence supporting exemption to the
viscosity limitations in international regulations governing marine
transport of bulk chemicals (MARPOL 73/78). The Panel has also made
arrangements for the U.S. Coast Guard to observe a stripping test on
an emptied vessel in port.
Phosgene. The Panel recently decided not to perform a large
field test of phosgene release at the Nevada Nuclear Test Site
this year. The Panel will continue investigating the feasibility of
performing this study at a future date and possibly at a different
location.
Comments are being prepared on the August 1986 EPA Health
Assessment Document on phosgene. Comments are due to EPA by
January 30, 1987.
Phthalate Esters. The Panel has begun discussions with EPA's
Test Rules Development Branch which may lead to a consent agreement to
complete environmental testing under TSCA Section 4. The Panel has
already completed an extensive battery of acute tests and a chronic
study on each of 14 phthalate esters under a Negotiated Testing
Agreement accepted by EPA in January 1982. The second phase of
testing, which was originally agreed to by the Agency in its 1982
Federal Register notice, was rejected by EPA in 1984 following the
court ease decision Invalidating NTA's. The Panel is hopeful that its
original proposal will now be accepted and that environmental effects
testing will be completed under a consent order.
Rubber Additives. The Panel submitted final reports to EPA on
the results of two comparative pharmacokinetics studies on
mercaptobenzothiazole and its disulfide derivative. The studies
confirmed that both compounds are handled similarly and are rapidly
37
CMA 038779
taken up and eliminated from the body following intravenous and oral
dosing.
Vlnvlidena Chloride. The Panel is preparing comments in
response to EPA’s Proposed Test Rule for 1,1-diehloroethylene (VDC)
(51 FR 28840). The proposal requires additional toxicology testing
under TSCA Section 4(a). The Panel feels additional testing is not
necessary since more than twenty VDC studies have indicated no health
concern. Comments on this proposal are due to EPA by January 14, 1987.
2. Communications Support
The department assisted in preparation of materials for submission
of a request for a "prior exemption" for BHT and developed proposed
media strategy for the submission.
The staff also continued to coordinate response to press inquiries
related to CFC research.

DEPARTMENTAL PROGRAM NOTES
Government Relations Department
1. Federal Grassroots Activities
During 1986 the Grassroots Program has undergone a transition in
its focus. Upon completion of the Grassroots effort in support of the
Superfund Reauthorixation, the program has been expanding its base
among CMA member companies and identifying several new issue areas for
involvement during 1987-1988. The objective is to evolve the program
into a multi-issue, permanent contact mechanism to advance CMA's
federal legislative advocacy efforts in environment, worker health and
safety, and economic/trade issues.
The priority issue for the Grassroots program during 1987 will be
air toxics emissions. Already much activity has begun toward
developing a grassroots network on air toxics. Eighty-nine Members of
the House and Senate have been targeted as key legislators in
Congressional activity on air toxics. Earlier this year member
company Grassroots Managers assigned Congressional Liaison
Representatives (CLRs) to lead the grassroots effort in their
Congressional Districts. CLRs have been involved in program and issue
orientation, in establishing relationships with assigned legislators,
and in the development of coalitions within their districts. These
coalitions, comprised of chemical company representatives and other
interested constituents, have been meeting and will continue to meet
in early 1987 to discuss the air toxics message and strategies for
communicating with key legislators. Meetings between CLRs, coalitions
and key legislators, will be scheduled for February-March 1987, during
the preliminary stages of debate on air toxics emissions.
Other program activities are underway and will continue in 1987
to develop an adaptability to changes in issue emphasis. In addition
38
CMA 038780
to air coxics two other issues are emerging for grassroots
consideration: worker notification and groundwater. An analysis of
key legislators in these issue areas is ongoing to determine CLR
assignments.
Education of Grassroots Managers and CLRs and message development
for worker notification and groundwater will begin in early 1987 in
anticipation of legislative activity in the 100th Congress. Efforts
will also continue to incorporate member companies into the program,
either through existing coalitions or through the building of new
CLR-key legislator relationships.
2. Federal Candidate Information Activities
The Candidate Information Task Group's activities for 1986 were
geared toward the November elections. The Task Group provided
opportunities for companies to meet non-incumbent candidates to the
House and Senate through a series of "Get Acquainted” sessions. Other
activities of the Task Group included analysis of CMA member company
employee PAC contributions to the key Members of the House and Senate;
identification of key races and candidates; and the mailing of an
"Issues ’86" packet to all candidates to the 100th Congress which
include economic and issues related information.
Although 1987 is a non-election year for Federal offices, the
Candidate Information Task Group has a tentative agenda which includes:
o Follow-up with Freshmen Congressmen who participated in CMA's
"Get Acquainted" sessions during 1986 and other key Members as
appropriate
o Identification of, and increased chemical industry visibility
with, 1988 Senate and House candidates
o Final analysis of CMA member company employee PAC contributions
during the 1986 elections
o Continued analysis of CMA member company employee PACs in 1987
Activities to support this agenda will include "Get Acquainted"
sessions with Senate candidates, and preparations of an "Issues '87"
publication.
The Candidate Information Task Group also plans to identify
member company Washington Representatives who are close to candidates
seeking their party's Presidential nomination to facilitate
communications of CMA positions on national issues of interest to the
chemical industry.
The Candidate Information Task Group will continue with an
aggressive and Innovative approach to improving the chemical industry
involvement in and visibility with candidates. The upcoming 1988
elections promise to be hotly contested and will soon dominate the
agenda of Congress and both national parties. fThe Candidate
39
CMA 038781
Information Task Group will continua to provide an opportunity for the
chemical industry to usa the elections to advance our capabilities.
Technical Department
Superfund activity has now shifted from the legislative to the
regulatory arena and many of the CERCLA amendments must be carefully
managed to avoid unreasonable regulations. CMA has analyzed both
CERCLA amendments and Title III, and has prepared a draft CMA action
plan. The draft is now in the hands of key CMA committee
representatives who, with their committees and task groups, will
develop specific and refined plans of action for managing important
CMA initiatives for these sweeping pieces of legislation.
Major legislative efforts in air, water, hazardous materials
transportation, worker notification of significant exposure and
possibly TSCA reauthorization are key legislative issues for this
year. Regulatory burdens continue to mount across the entire spectrum
of issues managed by CMA.
CMA's NCRIC, CAER and Air Toxics Control Policy activities
continue to draw favorable consents from both the government and
private sectors.

REPORT OF
TAX POLICY COMMITTEE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Overview
In 1986, the Tax Policy Committee was very deeply involved in
key legislative issues affecting the chemical industry. Responding
to the numerous problems raised in both tax reform and Superfund
reauthorization legislation, the Coomiittee responsibly handled a vide
range of tax issues that could increase industry tax costs by more
than $6 billion annually.
Tax Reform Legislation
For over two years the Tax Policy Committee has dealt with the
basic issues of tax reform legislation.
In 1985, President Reagan
proposed a 5-year shift of over $120 billion in individual tax
burdens to business taxpayers. Vithin the business sector, the
President's tax program would finance lower corporate and individual
tax rates by repealing the investment tax credit and reducing
depreciation allowances. In addition, there would be significant
changes in the tax treatment of international business activities
that would substantially increase the tax costs of U.S. corporations.
In December 1985, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3838
a bill whose basic tax reform philosophy was in agreement with that
advocated by the President. CMA's major tax activity in 1986 was
before the Senate Committee on Finance.
In addition to the issues
identified in the House bill, CMA successfully lobbied the Finance
Committee to reject several tax proposals that would have had a
disproportionate impact on the chemical industry. CMA also
successfully lobbied the Finance Committa to include favorable
amendments on the issues identified in the House bill. Chemical
industry losses will be offset in part by more favorable depreciation
treatment and lower corporate tax rates.
During the House-Senate Conference, CMA supported the Senate
bill. However, CMA successfully lobbied the Conferees to reduce the
penalty on depreciation in the alternative minimum tax. The overall
impact of the tax bill will increase taxes paid by the chemicl
industry over the next 5 years. That increase, however, is not as
great as the Increase other capital intensive industries sustained in
this legislation.
Superfund Lexislation
The Tax Policy Committee continued to provide technical
assistance in 1986 to the Government Relations Committee on Superfund
funding issues, including broad base tax proposals. This assistance
provided a major contribution to the effectiveness of CMA's superfund
legislative advocacy.
CMA
EXHIBIT K
LIABILITY REFORM IN THE,STATES
OBJECTIVE:
To achieve positive reforms of tort law through state legislation, and
to protect the chemical industry from being singled out for
discriminatory or punitive treatment in such legislation.
BACKGROUND AND STATUS:
Executive Committee Request. At its November meeting, the Executive
Committee requested that a report on state tort reform be prepared to
address model state legislation and coalitions, end to provide a status
report on 1986/87 state legislative activity.
1986 Legislative Activity. Approximately 35 states passed some
reform legislation in 1986. Many of these lews dealt only with
areas, such as day-care centers or municipal liability. Only a
states, such as Colorado, Connecticut, Vashington, and Florida,
comprehensive reform bills. The issues that have seen the most
in 1986 were:
tort
single
few
passed
activity
* modification or elimination of joint and several liability
* caps on non-economic damages
- collateral source rules to deal with the problem of double
payments
In most eases, the chemical industry has shared in the benefits of
general tort reform. However, injuries involving hazardous substances
were partially or, in some cases, completely excluded from some of the
significant reforms, particularly the limitation on joint and several
liability.
CMA Activities. CMA has undertaken the following activities to seek
positive reforms in state tort law:
o Developed and distributed an issues book that sets forth and
discusses 13 priority tort law reforms for adoption in the
states. These issues were divided into three tiers based on
their relative impact on the chemical industry. Home companies,
however, may have different priorities based on factors unique to
these companies. The first tier included five issues relative to
reforms which CMA recommended es the basic elements in any
meaningful bill:*
* Non-economic damages should be capped
- Damages should be reduced by the amount of collateral source
payments
- Joint and several liability should be eliminated
- Awards of punitive damages should he carefully scrutinized and
controlled by the court
- Fault should be required for liability
CMA 038785
The second tier of priority issues included:
Limit contingency fees
Require qualified expert testimony
Eliminate liability without causation
Provide that initial warnings are adequate
The third tier of priority issues included:
- Eliminate non-mutual collateral estoppel
• Bar evidence of subsequent remedial measures
- Eliminate liability for conduct in compliance with government
standards
- Eliminate recovery for commercial loss
o Using the priority issues book as a guide, CMA has actively
participated in the preparation of model legislation by the
American Legislative Exchange Council. ALEC is a national
organization of approximately 2000 conservative state
legislators. Proposed legislative language was adopted for
inclusion in ALEC's "Source Book of American State Legislation,
1987-88." CMA's tort reform'issues resource book was utilized in
the development of this language and CMA objectives, as set forth
in the issues book, were incorporated. The ALEC source book was
sent to all 7,461 state legislators in December.
o During the same time period, CMA worked with the American Tort
Reform Association. ATRA is a broad based coalition created for
the specific purpose of supporting tort reform. CMA served on
ATRA's Legal Conaittee which prepared policy papers on various
tort reform issues. The final policy papers, a major supporting
document for ALEC's model bills, and a copy of ALEC's model
legislation were published in September in the "ATRA Legislative
Resource Book." This manual has been delivered to all U.R.
Congressmen, state Governors and legislators, state tort reform
coalitions and all ATRA members.
o Successful tort reform has frequently involved the use of broad
based coalitions, including major industries, small businesses,
doctors and local governments.
o The Texas Chemical Council has been very active in tort reform
coalition efforts and could be used as a guide by other chemical
councils.
o CMA has selected priority states and contacts are being developed
with those states.
In addition, these contacts are being
expanded by working in cooperation with the Council of Chemical
Association Executives.
CMA 038786
o CMA continues to monitor and support tort reform in all states.
The text of the ALEC model bills and the status of 1986 tort
reform initiatives with a state by state outlook for 1987 is
available from CMA.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
o CMA and its member companies should support existing ALEC model
legislation rather than drafting a separate chemical industry
model bill. These proposals have been developed by a broad based
coalition, which included CMA, and agreement has been reached as
to the provisions which largely coincide with the chemical
industry's priorities. Drafting additional proposals at this
time could create a wedge dividing proponents of tort reform.
Moreover, a model bill created by the chemical Industry is
unlikely to receive the broad support available through the ALEC

and to participate in or initiate broad based state coalitions,
such as the Texas model, to achieve tort reform.

Communications Committee 1987 Report
to CMA Board of Directors
Michael E. Thompson*
Since this report is — by definition — an annual report,
there's a natural temptation, to which I'm going to yield, to
look back at the events of the past year and ask the familiar
question: "Are we better off than we were 12 months ago?"
When I put that question to the members of the communications
committee, the response was a strong conviction that the chemical
industry today is In better standing with the public and the
press than it was last year. This Improvement Is real, and even
verifiable, as I'll point out in a minute. In short, it feels
good and it is good, or at least getting better.
In our report to you last year, the committee felt that the
industry was ready to make a move in improving Its reputation.
What the Industry needed was continued commitment from senior
management, a year without a major domestic incident, a major
communications effort from the industry's plant people and
communications professionals, and, frankly, a bit of luck.
Well, we got a lot of what we needed in 1986.
Starting at the top, senior managers in the industry gave their
personal and corporate endorsement to our communications efforts,
particularly on Superfund, CAER, and air toxics. Word has spread
throughout your organizations that it is good business to commit
time and manpower to communicating on these important issues.
We also had a year without a major chemical incident to rekindle
the fears of Bhopal. The closest we came was the train
derailment near Mlamisburg, Ohio. Fortunately, there was no loss
of life or serious injury and the operating and communications
people involved in the incident did their Jobs well. As a
result, the accident was portrayed in the media as being as much
a rail mishap as a chemical-related problem.
Perhaps the worst reporting on the Mlamisburg Incident may have
occurred on the ABC network coverage of the golf tournament that
was being played in nearby Dayton at the time of the wreck. I
can remember cringing In front of ay tv set watching and
listening to those two noted environmental reporters — Dave Harr
and Jim McKay — discussing how to play golf in sulfur fumes.

We also seemed to have escaped much residual blame for the recent
Rhine River spill In Switzerland. Frankly, I'm at a loss as to
why that Incident didn't receive more critical coverage in the
U.S., but I'm sure not complaining about it. Each day without a
page-one incident puts Bhopal one more day behind us.
1986 also saw a remarkable communications effort in the
industry's support of the CAER program at the local level. If we
had the time, I could have filled both days of this meeting with
success stories on the communication of the CAER program in our
plant communities.
In fact, 1986 could be called the Year of the Chemical Plant Open
House. The chemical industry held more open houses than Century
21 last year and the overwhelmingly positive results reflect the
considerable effort that went Into these activities. I can't
recall a single negative episode in the thousands of CAER-related
communications activities that took place in 1986.
These local activities have further enhanced the role of the
chemical plant manager as a communicator in his local community.
These individuals today are more willing and capable of
representing your companies and our industry than ever before.
It's also clear to the committee that many companies are now
placing increased value on communications skills when senior
management selects the people to serve as your plant managers.
On the media relations front in 1986, the committee felt that we
generally received fair coverage. Our relationships with
environmental reporters for many major media were further
strengthened during the year. Familiarity breeds respect in this
- regard, and we had another year to Increase our industry's
credibility with these reporters. In addition, all of our skins
got a little bit thicker in 1986 as the industry learned anew
that working with the media is a tough, no-nonsense, and sometime
frustrating part of all of our Jobs. As a result, our collective
tolerance level with the media is even higher than it was. We
have learned that no one story or single episode is critical and
that it's the long term results that count in working with the
press.
As a result of these and other efforts in 1986, the public's
opinion of our industry improved, at least if you believe the
public opinion surveys. I won't go into all the statistics, but
I think a few trends are worth comment.
According to one prestigious national survey, the public's view
of our Industry improved measurably. Our approval rating in this
survey Increased by about 40 percent during 1986. However,
fairness requires me to point out that we started the year dead
last among 15 industries, with a rating so low that any
improvement would seem large by comparison. This improvement,
though slight, moved us from 15th place to about 12th or 13th on
CMA 038789
the industry list. We're above the alcohol and nuclear power
industries and very close to the electric utility industry. Now
our standing doesn't begin to compare with the ratings of the
top-rated computer industry or the food and retailing industries.
But we moved up a notch or two and our ranking is the highest
it's been since 1982. That has to qualify as good news.
This survey showed two other items of special interest. First,
in a special questionnaire, the plastics Industry received an
approval rating that would place it at about 5th place on the
15-industry list. Since many of the companies here today have
some interest in plastics, this approval rating should be
encouraging.
And, secondly, the oil industry, which for years had been in the
public's doghouse. Improved noticeably. In 1982 the oil guys
were in last place. By the fourth quarter of 1986 oil had moved
all the way up to about the middle of the 15 industries. So
major improvement is possible if we persevere.
Other results from other surveys show mixed results — either the
public's opinion about us stayed the same or improved only
slightly. We seem to be rebounding slowly from last year's
rock-bottom ratings.
Yet we should not confuse these slight improvements with any
lessening of the public's concern about the environment and our
industry.
Survey after survey continue to show that the American people
place environmental concerns very high among their priorities,
even to the point of preferring the environment over jobs or
higher prices when faced with a choice in the surveys.
The public feels that the environment is improving, but feels
that the improvement has been progressing too slowly and that
nobody — business or government — is acting quickly enough.
The public continues to rank the disposal of hazardous wastes as
its number one environmental concern and cites the chemical
industry consistently as the country's primary source of air and
water pollution.
Faced with these conditions, the communications committee's 1987
objectives reflect our enthusiasm to support CHA's advocacy
efforts and the opportunity to parlay these efforts, where
possible, into improved communications with the public at large.
Heading our project list for 1987 Is the followup on our CAER
communication achievements of 1986. If there is a CMA member
plant that hasn't yet conducted a CAER communications activity,
we want to find it and get it on track with the rest of the
industry.
CMA 038790
CAER has been THE leadership effort for the chemical industry
during this decade and we must not let it wither -- either in an
operating or a communications sense. The committee's greatest
fear is that our plant people will become complacent about CAER
now that they have gone through all the effort of establishing it
in their communities. Pardon the pun, but CAER will require a
lot of tender loving care in the future if it is to continue as
the industry's flagship health and safety program.
Another of the many values of CAER is that it gives us the
opportunity to deal from strength in conducting our future
communications activities at the plant level. With this in mind,
the committee and CMA staff are building on CAER's success in
tackling the industry's two upcoming communications hurdles —
air toxics and the implementation of the Title III provisions of
Superfund.
In the air toxics area, a survey of the committee found that most
of the companies intend to treat their air toxics communications
as an extension of the CAER program.
However, we should realize that the air toxics issue presents
some communications barriers that are quite different from our
CAER effort.
For one thing, chemical plants in a community usually produce
widely differing product slates. So while one plant can boast to
the local media about its relatively clean products and lack of
toxic air emissions, a neighboring plant manager may have a devil
of a time explaining why he can't comment about chronic air
emissions of his highly-toxlc products. Remember too that most
of these same plants worked closely together in introducing the
' CAER program to the community. The unified local approach that
worked so well with the CAER program also could suffer when
different plants are at different stages of implementing their
air toxics programs.
Another concern is that many plant managers understandably are
reluctant to be as aggressive in promoting the air toxics issue
as they were with CAER. The reason is clear: Admitting to
chronic air emissions of toxic chemicals is not a pleasant duty.
And in some cases managers are not in a position to comment about
the long-term effects of exposure to these emissions.
In overcoming these concerns, the communications committee, CMA
staff, and your local managers will carry out a comprehensive and
effective communications program. We've already held our first
air toxics communications workshop — earlier this month in
Houston. It was well attended, Including many plant managers,
and many important questions were raised. We do plan to be a bit
cautious in our approach to this communications program, and I
hope you agree with our thinking.
CMA 038791
W also plan to build on the CAER communications success In
helping local plant people cope with the Title III provision of
Superfund. These provisions will require your plants to make
more information available about your products and processes than
ever before. It will all be available at once and it will be
available to anyone who wants it. Already some environmental
groups have shown what they can do to embarrass us with our own
information taken out of context. The committee has formed a
separate task group that will help us formulate our
communications policy in this area.
Our final major objective in 1987 is to continue to assist the
state chemical councils in improving their communications
capabilities. We've already have made important progress in
Illinois, Louisiana, and New Jersey and we'll be working with
more states in the future.
This state-level activity becomes more important when you realize
that Proposition-65-type legislation will expand from California
to many other states. The CICs so far have been receptive to our
help and we plan to continue this partnership.
So our 1987 agenda will consist of four major objectives:
following up on CAER communications, extending our communications
activities to cover the air toxics and Title III issues, and
working with the CICs. These objectives are in addition, of
course, to our ongoing work with other committees within CMA to
provide communications counsel and hands-on help as required.
The committee feels that these goals are achievable with current
manpower and with current resources.
I would like to close with a comment that doesn't fall readily
into our normal communications topics.
The committee feels that we should be wary of the recent attacks
on the so-called "corpocracy" of major U.S. companies. While
it's too early to call this a major trend, there are a lot of
people cut there, Including some in the current administration,
who may well be taking shots at U.S. businessmen.
Executives could be blamed for everything from working too hard
on their golf game to operating bloated and inefficient
organizations to sacrificing the blue-collar worker's future for
the sake of their friends in the executive suite.
Along these lines, GM may be the first company to enter this
quagmire. That company's so-so performance, the Perot buyout,
the wave of Midwest plant closings, and a weak product slate have
combined to focus public and media attention on the personal
capabilities of those managing the giant auto company.
CMA 038792
While GM may be the first, we shouldn't be fooled into thinking
the public's attention will stop there. This is a trend we'll
all have to watch very closely.
In conclusion, 1986 saw the chemical industry's reputation with
the public improve for the first time in several years. This
uptick did not come about by accident. It occurred because we
operated safely, moved aggressively to meet the public's
legitimate concerns about our operations, and took the time to
tell people what we were doing.
Through CAER and other programs we showed a lot of confidence in
the American public last year. Maybe they're beginning to return
that confidence. I hope so.
We look forward to earning your continued support throughout
1987. I will be pleased to try to answer any questions you might
have about the communications committee and our 1987 plans.

THE PATENT AND TRADEMARK COMMITTEE
JANUARY 27, 1987
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In 1986, CMA, through the Patent and Trademark Committee ("PATC” or
"the Committee"), has been an instrumental voice in providing industry
input to the U.S. Administration and Congress in the development of patent
policies at home and abroad. The PATC has also advocated CMA positions
directly with foreign authorities, as appropriate, and with other domestic
and foreign industry groups.
During the past year, CMA, through the PATC, has obtained increased
visibility and respect in the industrial property rights area.
Congressional and Agency staffs solicit CMA's comments on pending domestic
legislation, aniticipated regulatory changes, and international
negotiations.
In the legislative arena,-the Committee continued its efforts on
patent term restoration legislation for chemicals. Moreover, the Committee
advocated enactment of process patent legislation and reviewed appropriate
CMA positions on federal laboratory utilization legislation, government
patent policy, and amendments to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as
amended.
In addition to advocacy efforts on legislation, the Committee
prepared written comments for submission by CMA on a number of regulatory
and international issues.
The Comnittee also participated in a number of the Administration's
investigations and information-gathering activities on the international
protection of industrial property rights and advised the CMA International
Trade Committee on the appropriate role of this subject in the new Round of
Multilateral Trade Negotiations.
In all these forums, the Committee has
stressed the importance of strengthened patent protection to U.S.
technological advancement, continued economic recovery, and productivity.
The PATC also played an important communications role in 1986 in
keeping CMA's member companies apprised of developments on industrial
property rights issues. The Committee communicated with the Board of
Directors and member companies on a number of patent issues through
mechanisms such as Action Advisories, other CMA reports, and newsletters.
By playing this coimnunications role, the Committee not only disseminated
information to member companies, but also became informed on the positions
of the members on patent issues. The Committee, in turn, was then better
able to formulate proposed CMA positions and advocate existing ones.
Finally, it is significant to note that the Conmittee has carried out
these 1986 activities with no expenditures for outside assistance, either
technical or legal. Written comnents were prepared and advocacy activities
carried out by Committee members, other designated CMA member company
representatives, and CMA staff. We also do not anticipate any major
outside assistance expenses during 1987.

WASTE MINIMIZATION PROGRAM
PURPOSE OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEW
The Environmental Management Conmittee's (EMC) Ad Hoc Task Group on
Waste Minimization presented a status report describing the vaste
minimization issue's importance and a possible CMA program at the
November Board of Director's meeting. The purpose of this review is
to obtain approval of a recommended CMA program.
BACKGROUND
The 1984 Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) require companies to establish voluntary waste minimization
programs and certify actions. Several states have in place or are
developing legislation requiring vaste minimization. Company waste
minimization efforts are also being scrutinized when permits for
waste facilities are requested. Alternatives for stronger federal
action are discussed in recent reports to Congress by the Office of
Technology Assessment and EPA. Applying greater pressure to force
waste minimization appears to be a high priority for public interest
groups. This goal is reflected in various thrusts toward achieving
zero discharge and opposition to siting new treatment and disposal
facilities.
The progress that industry has made in implementing voluntary waste
minimization programs will be evaluated by Congress in hearings
beginning in 1987. If industry cannot demonstrate sufficient
progresst public interest groups may be able to convince Congress to
adopt extreme amendments as part of RCRA's reauthorization which is
scheduled in 1988. The amendments could include such undesirable
intrusions into industry operations as limits on waste generation,
process restrictions, and outside audits.
Companies are already confronted with increasing costs of vaste
disposal as EPA expands the scope of wastes regulated as hazardous
under RCRA, implements further land disposal pretreatment
requirements, and further tightens controls over waste management
practices. Many companies have significantly reduced their waste.
At this time, however, there is no reliable national data to
demonstrate industrywide progress, and F.PA's programs are under
attack.
III.
TIMING
Waste minimization is likely to be an issue in RCRA hearings and
reauthorization.
In addition, EPA is committed to improve waste
minimization programs and data bases in 1987, which it must do to
reduce Congressional oversight pressures. CMA needs to start its
program early in 1987 to provide assistance to EPA and to develop an
industry position that frames the debete in terms that are
reasonable. Although the issue is not at a crisis stage, by
establishing a program and data base early, CMA will be in the best
position to achieve its objectives over the next few yesrs.
CMA 038795
2
PROPOSED WASTE MINIMIZATION PROGRAM
Ob 1 active - Inform and assise member companies in reducing wastes
at the source, increasing recycle, and reducing disposal risks.
Expected benefits of this effort are:
o
better protection of human health and the environment;
o
avoiding onerous legislation that mandates waste reduction;
o
limiting disposal costs and future cleanup liability; and
o
improving public understanding of industry generation and
disposal practices.
Proposed CMA Position on Waste Minimization
CMA supports efforts of its member companies to minimize waste. CMA
member companies have programs in place that have resulted in
reduced air, water, and solid, waste releases to the environment. To
achieve further progress, individual companies are encouraged to
expand their programs to respond to additional waste minimization
opportunities that exist in their operations. CMA will inform and
assist its member companies in reducing wastes by implementing a
waste minimization program.
Activities
o
An industry program to promote and assist member companies in
developing and carrying out waste minimization programs (i.e.,
workshops, resource manuals, newsletter, and swards program).
o
Legislative and regulatory advocacy support to address waste
minimization issues before Congress and EPA.
o
Measurement of waste minimization progress in order to document
progress (i.e-, uniform definitions of key terms, definition of
measurement needs, evaluation of existing data systems and
modification thereof).
o
Communications of member company and industry waste
minimization activities (i.e., identification of key perceptions,
development of a strategy to effectively communicate
industrywide and anecdotal information to targeted audiences on
a continuing basis).
Further CMA programmatic action, i.e., establishing percentage
reduction goals similar to CMA's snsrgy conservation program or
enactment of an eir toxics type control program with detailed
implementation steps, may ba considered and recommended in the
future to the Executive Comittee and Board of Directors on an as
needed basis.
CMA 038796

RES^HJKCE NEEDS
o
CMA Staff Impact
To support the four activities noted above, a portion of a
professional person and some support staff time will be
necessary. A request for the necessary personnel is being
addressed as part of CMA's FT 87/88 budget process.
o
Outside Purchased Services Impact
The EMC has recomended $A0K funding for outside purchased
services as part of their FT 87/88 budget proposals.
o
Member Company Resources Impact
Approximately 10 to 15 member company volunteers will be needed
to carry this effort forward through design and implementation.

CONCEPTS TOR FEDERAL GROUNDWATER LEG!STATION
I. Background
Ci.ti.2ans and public officials vitw groundwater contamination as a
national problem. Consequently, groundwater will become a news media
issue aimed at commercial and industrial sources.
Several federal groundwater bills, introduced in the 94th Congress,
will serve to focus future groundwater debates. Senator Purenberger
(R-MN) and Senator Burdick (D-ND) will each introduce a comprehensive
federal groundwater bill early in tha 100th Congress. Similar bills will
be introduced in the House. Groundwater legislation could imposa product
usa restrictions (e.g., pesticides, detergents, solvents), require
additional protection or remediation activities, and introduce onerous
product liability concepts.
Many states have or are enacting groundwater legislation and are
implementing groundwater management programs. State efforts may establish
tha need for water usa restrictions, land usa planning decisions, new
victim compensation concerns, and site-specific regulatory frameworks
which could be tima/cost consuming.
CMA's previously approved groundwater positions ware used to
establish proposed CMA federal legislative concepts and a legislative
strategy for participation in tha federal groundwater debate. Using these
concepts, CMA will strive to influence tha Congressional groundwater
debate so that any legislation enacted resembles CMA's position as closely
as possible. To support this effort, CMA is prepared ro participate
activaly in the federal groundwater debate during the 100th Congress.
Early participation in tha debate will hal'p CMA focus the emerging
discussions and will identify CMA aa an involved knowledgeable party.
II. Simary of CMA's Concepts for Federal Groundwater Legislation
Primary responsibility for management of groundwater should continue
to reside with the states. Each state should develop and Implement a
comprehensive groundwater management program. A state groundwater
management program should address the following components: (I) character­
ization and planning; (2) usa of appropriate groundwater objectives and
standards; (3) protsction; (4) remediation; (5) monitoring; and (6)
interstate groundweter impacts.
Fadsral assistancs should ba available to help the states perform
these tasks. This assistance cen include: (1) federal funding to assist
the states develop end implement their groundwater management programs;
(2) technical Information and guidance; and (3) scientifically-based
criteria and standards for states' use in making groundwater protection
and remediation decisions. Howsver, ths federal involvement should not
include the ability to make decisions for the state about the most
appropriate way to implement the components of the state program.

State Groundwater Management Prograa
Each stata should davalop a groundwater management program. Oevelopman
and implementation of the program would be the responsibility of the
state; but federal assistance should be available to help the state
perform these tasks. Failure by the state to develop a program would
only lead to a loss of any further federal assistance for program
implementation.
A state program should have to address the following components:
A program to characterize state groundwater resources to the
extent necessary for state planning.
Use of appropriate groundwater objectives and standards.
A prograa to protect state groundwater resources from
sources of contamination.
A process to address groundwater remediation needs.
A groundwater monitoring program.
A process to address interstate groundwater Impacts.
The following are detailed descriptions of each of these components.
Groundwater Characterization
The state oust establish a program to characterize its
groundwater resources to the extent necessary for the state
planning.
The program should rely on existing data where that is
available and feasible.
The state should consult with the United States Geological
Survey (USGS) and the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) for guidance on developing the
characterization program.
The state could decide not to characterize particular
portions of the groundwater resource, if it determines chat
such action is not necessary at that time.
Based upon its characterization program, the state could
divide its groundwater into various categories, which may
require different management approaches.
Groundwater Objectives and Standards
The stata must establish appropriate groundwater objectives.
Objectives apply to individual aquifers or portions of
aquifers.
The objectives oust identify the current and reasonably
anticipated future uses of the groundwater.
Based upon the objectives, the state must identify standards
that will protect availability of the groundwater for
those identified uses. Standards must be set using
scientifically-valid bases.
For regulating drinking water supply, the state must use
maximum contaminant levels (MCL's) adopted by EPA under the
Safe Drinking Water Act, whenever a substance has an MCL.
The state should use criteria developed by EPA to sac
numarleal usa standards. (This would require e new work
effort, criteria development, at EPA.)
Protection Programs
The state must davalop
resources from sources
groundwater protection
the goal of minimizing
a program to protect its groundwater
of contamination.
Tn developing the
program, the state should consider
releases to groundwater.
In developing its protection program, the state must
identify and evaluate existing and potential sources of
contamination.
The program could include, as appropriate, source controls,
land use controls, groundwater withdrawal limitations, and
any other suitable protection measures.
The program must be coordinated with existing source control
programs, including those under RCRA. SDWA, FTFRA, and CVA,
and must be consistent with existing federal provisions
concerning adequate hazardous waste treatment or disposal
capacity.
The program must address all significant sources of
contamination.
Source controls could apply uniformly statewide or could
apply to specific types of sources or individual sources.
Source control requirements should make appropriate
distinctions among new and old sources, different types of
sources, and specific unique sources.
Protection measures must take into account applicable
groundwater objectives and standards. Some minimum
protection measures should be developed for all areas of the
state.
CMA 038801
The stats must determine how its program will be
ijnplanantad (e.g., voluntary controls, regulations,
training, aducation, and any other appropriate measures.)
Tha program must include adequate authority for the state to
enforce protection requirements.
Groundwater Remediation
The state must develop a process to address groundwater
remediation needs.
When needed, remedial measures should be formulated on a
case specific basis and take into account any appropriate
groundwater objectives/standards.
The state remediation process must be coordinated with
applicable state and federal laws, including state tort
and watar rights law.
The state must address all sources for which there may he
significant remedial concerns.
The remediation process must include adequate authority for
the state to enforce remedial requirements.
Monitoring Programs
The state must develop a groundwater monitoring program.
The program must be formulated to serve three purposes;
a. Assess the extent to which groundwater meers applicable
groundwater objectives and standards.
b. Provide information on groundwater trends and,
contaminants.
c. Provide information on sources of contamination as
necessary.
The program must include measures to ensure that data
gathered are scientifically valid.
The state should consult with the United States Geological
Survey and EPA for guidance on developing the monitoring
program.
The state could establish a data management system that
incorporates all relevant monitoring data. The data
management system should include information so the user
can identify the quality control and quality assurance of
the data before those data are used.

Interstate Impacts
The seat* program should include a mechanism to assess
interstate impacts and to develop interstate agreements,
where appropriate.

Concepts for Federal Groundwater legislation
Federal Role in Groundwater Management
Federal funding would be available to assist the states in
developing their programs.
If a state submits a groundwater management program to EPA
that includes all of the required components, EPA must accept the
program and provide funding to assist in implementation.
EPA may not judge the substantive adequacy of the state program
as long as the state program includes all of the required
componenta and the state certifies that their program complies
with the statutory requirements.
EPA and USGS must assist the states by developing and providing
groundwater quality criteria, technical Information, and
guidance on groundwater issues.

TRADE LAW REMEDIES CONCERNING IMPORTS THREATENING
NATIONAL SECURITY
BACKGROUND AND STATUS:
Current trade lav authorizes the President to restrict imports of
products which threaten national security. A list of such products is
maintained by the General Services Administration. Additions to the
list are handled by the Department of Commerce through a petition
process. A ruling on the petition must occur within one year of its
filing.
If favorable, the ruling must then be acted upon by the
President, but no deadlines currently exist for Presidential actions.
The products currently included on the list which could be
considered to be chemicals are either ores or chemical element
products. Nevertheless, there is good reason to believe chat, as
petrochemical industries continue to develop in research-rich areas of
the world causing U.S. plant closures, additional chemical products
such as petrochemicals would be added to the list.
A major omnibus trade bill is anticipated from the 100th
Congress. The CMA International Trade Committee has already proposed a
number of positions to the Board which address different facets of
existing trade law which CMA will be able to address either directly or
through coalitions during the upcoming Congressional deliberations.
CMA POSITION:
CMA supports the strengthening of Section 232 of the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962 and recommends the following chenges to achieve
this aim.
o Shorten the time period allotted for the Secretary of Commerce
to act on Section 232 petitions.
o Shorten the time for existing mandatory deadlines, or impose
deadlines where none exist, by which both the Secretary of
Commerce and the President must act on Section 232
investigations.
o Require public disclosure of final actions on petitions.
ACTION REQUESTED
Approval of attached position.

TRADE LAW REMEDIES CONCERNING IMPORTS THREATENING NATIONAL
SECURITY
Current Lav
Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 authorizes the
President to restrict imports of products which threaten national
security. The lav requires the Secretary of Commerce to begin an
investigation of the potential national security impact of
imports of a produet upon the request of another government
agency or department, an interested party, or his own volition.
If the Secretary determines that there is some threat to national
security, he must advise the President within one year of the
initiation of the investigation. However, the President is not
obliged to answer this petition within a specific period.
Sampling of Proposals Made for Legislative Changes
Several proposals have been made to establish deadlines for
Presidential action, such as a requirement that the President act
within one year after receiving the Secretary's advice. Another
suggestion would establish a 90-day deadline. Some would im­
plement the Secretary's recommendations if the President has not
acted within 90 days after receiving the report. Another sug­
gestion would transfer the authority from the President.to the
USTR and would require the USTR to act within the 90 days after
receiving the Secretary's recommendations.
' CMA POSITIOM:
Certain products (including some chemicals) are essential to the
United States in times of national emergency. The Federal
Government should ensure that import competition does not hinder
the capacity of domestic industries to guarantee adequate sup­
plies of these essential products.
Legislation that would
provide for deadlines will force the Administration to focus on
questions of national security and imports in a timely manner.
However, transferring current presidential authority to the USTR
seems ineffective since the USTR is part of the Administration
and as a practical matter would not act without the President's
authority.
Certain chemical feedstocks as well as derivative products could
fall into the category of being essential to national security.
The issue as to what extent the national security and foreign
policy concerns outweigh the economic benefits of short term
lover prices, and the question of what national security costs
should be borne by the taxpayers to protect;against supply
disruption n ed to be addressed.

EXHIBIT Q
American National Standard for Precautionary
labeling of Hazardous Industrial Chemicals
(ANSI Z129.1-1987)
BACKGROUND: Since 1946, CMA (MCA) has issued general labeling guide­
lines for the chemical industry. In 1976, CMA became the
Secretariat for the development of ANSI Z129.1: the American
National Standard for Precautionary Labeling of Hazardous
Industrial Chemicals. The guidelines then became a voluntary
consensus standard under the auspices of the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI).
ANSI Z129.1 was published in 1976 and 1982, and has been
extensively revised by the CMA Health and Safety Committee's
Labeling Task Group for a 1987 printing. After presentation to
the Executive Committee and Board, the draft standard will enter
the ANSI consensus process by which CMA member companies,
interested industry groups, labor unions, government agencies,
consumer coalitions and professional societies review and vote on
the standard. Final submission to the ANSI Board of Review is
projected for mid-1987.
SIGNIFICANCE Of ANSI Z129.1> The 1987 revision of ANSI Z129.1 is
particularly relevant to the chemical industry for the following
reasons:
o
The OSHA Hazard Cosstunication Standard requires labeling
of all hazardous industrial chemicals and chemical mixtures.
o
In 1986, OSHA field inspectors issued citations to CMA member
companies for a variety of labeling violations, including the
lack of target organ/system hazard warnings on labels.
o
The performance-oriented nature of the OSHA Hazard Communica­
tion Standard and the complementary generic labeling guide­
lines in ANSI Z129.1 provide both guidance and flexibility to
CMA member companies.
o
A litigious trend toward industry liability for alleged
occupational illnesses has put the industry at risk for
failure to fulfill the "duty to warn."
PRIMARY ISSUES IN ANSI Z129.1-1987;
o
In light of the regulatory and liability issues listed
above, ANSI Z129.1-1987 focuses for the first time on
labeling of delayed (chronic) hazards and target organ/
system hazards.
o
Guidance for immediate (acute) hazards has been revised.
2
o
As ouch S3 possible* all guidelines in the standard have been
compared and adjusted for compliance with hey regulatory
statutes, e.g., the OSKA Hazard Comnunication Standard, TSCA,
FIFRA, OCT labeling requirements, etc.
ADVOCACY PLANS;
ACTION
o
Announcement of the availability of the standard in trade
journals, newsletters, and other appropriate forums.
o
Implementation workshops for CMA member companies, industry
groups, and government officials in 1987-1988.
requiredt
Endorse the submission of the proposed revised
labeling standard (ANSI 2129.1-1987) for consensus
review, followed by American National Standards
Institute approval and adoption.
