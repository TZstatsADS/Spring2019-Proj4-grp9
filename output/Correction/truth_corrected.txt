welcome this portunity to review for you the plans and structured to meet our assignment and responsibility to the mca under conditions so changed from the committee evolution the committee was first established in the mid as you will there i pursue a career in so as to assure an adequate supply of chemists for the world war ii birth rates would result in an oversupply of chemists in the early the chemical industry beginning in and the layoffs of employed chemists and chemical we began to focus on the quality and type of training suitable for chemists going into  cma skqinr in looking we are confronted with a highly confused picture concerning the labor reach varying ranging from prediction of years of oversupply to dire warnings of impending historical trend data for predicting technical manpower supplies ten years from now forces some degree of uncertainty into the but the weight of the evidence seems to as mode by similarly competent are considered to be much more we can discuss these figures with more in such studies predict we will experience a sharp downward trend in and degrees awarded in chemistry and all engineering during the next four if this downward trend there is reason to believe that a shortage of some proportions could develop in the supply of scientific and engineering as  chemistry declined for the first time in oq we conclude that a high declined since statistics for each year indicate an increased number of  undergraduate enrollments and earned degrees in engineering are declining from the total engineering bachelor supply of graduating in there are some that claim that even larger decreases in the employed technical comes nee i susp ct w will find the students moving ever farther away from the chemical a developm nt we would all like to avoid if cma uvjacj requiring many high level intellects to effectively manage and operate will depend largely on the prestige of the working conditions and personal we make the prediction this number will remain a reasonably stable percentage f the total industrial at the risk of we have reached this conclusion by assuming two important opposing demand trends will tend to balance each the downward trend involved during the past jp activities accounted for a large fraction of total technical with this fraction tending to become as is one can logically reason future needs for cance as users or chemically trained could possibly impose heavy future we believe continued reductions in chemistry and engineering majors and earned degrees will likely leadto shortages of technical graduate manpower in four or eight years in problems because the new chemists and engineers we will hire then are in the educational pipeline restoration of confidence in industry if you agree with me that there has indeed been a loss of confidence by the student body in our the question then arises as to what steps we can take to restore we of the committee feel this is a serious matter that should be promptly
