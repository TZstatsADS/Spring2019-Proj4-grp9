 tax policy committee
january  
in  che tax policy committee was very deeply involved in
key legislative issues affecting the chemical 
responding
co the numerous problems raised in both tax reform and superfund
reauthorization  the committee effectively handled a wide
range of tax issues that could increase industry tax costs by more
chan  billion 
since   the tax policy committee has focused on
che major tax revision issues that are of continuing concern to the
chemical 
these issues were first raised in the context of
che treasury   tax reform proposals and later in the
preparation of  testimony on president  may  tax
reform program before the house committee on ways and 
in  president   tax reform program would
shift almost  billion of the federal income tax burdens now borne
by individuals to the business 
the  program would
substantially increase the tax burdens of businesses chat are capital
intensive and that engage in significant international 
the specific issues raised in the  program are set
out in detail at tab  of our committee 
for this reason i
will not repeat that discussion except to reiterate why federal tax
issues are so vitally important to the chemical 
 let me emphasize that for many years the chemical
industry has enjoyed one of the most favorable tax positions among
 industrial 
both reasonable capital cost recovery
periods and the investment tax credit have been available for
chemical manufacturing investments for a number of 
to some
 the principal achievement of the accelerated cost recovery
system  adopted as part of president   tax
 was to provide other industries with tax depreciation
comparable to chat which the chemical industry 
beyond its favorable depreciation  the chemical
industry is unique among capital intensive industries in che extent
to which it can utilize the investment tax credits 
in
 the chemical industry invested more chan  billion in new
plant and  almost  percent of chose expenditures
qualified for che investment tax 
in current  the
investment tax credit reduces the annual tax bill of the 
chemical industry by over  
 the chemical industry is far more dependent on
international trade than many other capital intensive 
for  in  che united states exported chemicals and allied
products with a value of  billion and in chat year imported
 
with a combined total of approximately  billion in
cma 
ic is clear that cma has a  vital interest in tax reform
legislation that reflects a uniquely chemical industry 
we
are organized under a comprehensive  plan to defend the
 interests in 
we are working cooperatively to
implement that plan on capitol 
we look forward to positive
achievements in the senate and in any tax legislation that may be
enacted this 
in  let me reiterate what i told you at this time last

the tax policy committee and its members have worked hard this
 the members of the committee are true tax professionals who
have devoted a substantial amount of time and effort to achieving the
objectives of the

while relatively   achievements in
 both legislative and  are unsurpassed in their

with congressional members and 
cma commissioned price waterhouse to conduct a study of effective tax
 rates in the chemical  the price waterhouse study of is
companies who are primarily engaged in chemical manufacturing shows
that these companies paid an effective tax rate of over  percent in

committee on hays and means would have devastating effects
on the  chemical manufacturing  particularly
damaging would be the proposed changes in depreciation rules
along with the proposed  depreciation  and
the alternative minimum  despite the proposed
reductions in statutory tax  these changes would raise
the effective tax rates to which chemical manufacturing
companies are exposed and  as a  materially

requires a balanced budget by fiscal  and requires presidential
sequestration orders across the board on outlays and budget authority in

three and reduces the top corporate rate from  to   reduces
the deductibility of business entertainment expenses to  percent of the
current  establishes a   percent minimum tax for both
corporations and individuals and establishes less favorable depreciation

grants and  billion for water pollution control through fy 
bills passed in differing forms by both the house and senate and now

 the decision is sure to be  but it dramatizes a
growing awareness among federal agency administrators that adhering to

we succeeded initially in limiting
th list of extremely toxic  for which such reporting would be
 to only those substances so acutely toxic that their release
in any amount would present an imminent and substantial endangerment to
human 
also included was language permitting a company to utilize
reasonable estimates rather than expensive direct monitoring for meeting
the reporting 
eventually  the list of extremely
toxic substances was broadened by a floor amendment sponsored by
congressman robert edgar  to include substances causing adverse

decision in new jersey state chamber of commerce  
the court of

 the hazard communication standard preempts the new jersey law as it
pertains to protection of employee health safety in the manufacturing

 there is no preemption insofar as the new jersey law applies to
employers outside the manufacturing sector or insofar as it requires

a ruling that the hazard communication standard preempts the new jersey

the question left unresolved by the steelworkers decision is to what
extent the other provisions of the new jersey law are preempted by the

remarks to  board of directors
 health and safety committee
january  
i am pleased to present to you today tha first annual report of the
health and safety 
this committee was formed by board action in january  to
provide the association a central focus for oversight and coordination
of health and safety policy and  with public health and safety
concerns being the central driving force behind most recent 
mental and chemical control laws and  the health and safety
committee gives cma the ability to orchestrate a consistently 
ed advocacy program for public health and safety  the 
 oversight of health and safety policy facilitates the integration
of these issues into programs and policy developments of the other
 resulting in a closer working relationship with the 
mental   engineering  
and state affairs committees and the biomedical and environmental
special 
the committee replaced two standing committees  the chemical
regulations advisory committee  and the occupational safety and
health committee  two executive committee task groups  the public
compensation task group and the uarep work  and reduced the number
of task groups from  to  this consolidation was accomplished
without disruption of any ongoing activities or significant loss of
relationships with outside  this has allowed us to address the
pressing issues with fever task groups and fever  reducing the
number of member company representatives  requiring less travel
and fewer 
the restructuring of the industry and of many cma member companies
has presented unique challenges in that several of the key task group
 and some of the committee members have had significant job
 resulting in some people turnover and changes in 
unlike the predecessor committees or task  the current task
groups no longer have  responsibility but have functional
responsibility based upon the expertise needed by the group to carry out
its  the functional units are risk  risk 
risk   and external affairs and are shown
schematically on page  of the 
the committee has  major goals that were developed at a planning
meeting shortly after the committee was  we can pick and choose
cma 

and appropriate task force expertise and resources needed to achieve
successful completion of each 
this creates a true matrix organization and allows us to focus
resources on an issue without redundancy and needless waste of time for
company or staff 
the committee and most of its task groups have kept busy all of
 because of the diversity and complexity of the issues for which the
committee is  the reorganization necessary to consolidate
the ongoing activities without loss of  and the constant demand
for action and reaction as a result of the several chemical releases
which have occurred at   and  we initiated
new programs to improve the  perception of the chemical industry
as being  we also have had some less visible but equally
necessary programs which are more basic and behind the  these
activities usually involve generally working with legislative or 
latory contacts on issues vital to the 
the remaining time that i have today will be spent discussing some
examples of  followed by a brief review of areas which the
committee anticipates will require priority attention in the 
following the bhopal  a special task  chaired by
hamilton hurst and reporting to the executive  developed the
two new chemical industry programs  program and the national chemical
response and information center  
the caer program was assigned to the health and safety committee
for implementation and  it has been well received and 
ues to generate favorable reaction from the media and 
industry reception has also been  over  companies have signed
up to participate in the caer program and have named an executive as the
 caer  the caer coordinator is a critical link
between the  facilities managers and the 
the caer task group has held a series of regional workshops at
which the program has been described to more than  chemical 
try  and over  sites have been selected to begin the
process for implementing  in  community coordinating
 which usually include emergency response  elected
 and representatives of industry and the  have been
 caer handbooks have been distributed in the  and other
communications  including    and
 have received wide distribution to facilities 
emergency response  and police and fire  a monthly caer
newsletter is prepared and distributed by the task 
caer has created a consnunlcatlons network for cma and member
companies to local emergency response groups and to the  federal
emergency management agency  other federal  and with
other trade 
cma 

caer has helped to prominently portray the industry as being
concerned with public health and safety and has given us the unique
opportunity to build public  we are continuing our efforts
to capitalize upon this  although caer has been highly
successful in showing positive actions that industry is  we have
some concerns of which you should be aware and that do require 
 of the  companies that have signed up for the caer  
have not submitted either of the  milestone reports which are now past
 this creates concern that ve may not be able to maintain the
credibility of the  we need your  through contacts you may
have in other  to continue to emphasize the importance of the
caer initiative to the current and future credibility of the 
turning now to the less visible programs the committee and its task
groups have  these activities are more numerous than the
  visible  such as  and have been equally
as effective in supporting  advocacy 
in response to public legislative demands following  the
occupational safety and health administration  developed their
special emphasis  designed to target chemical plants for 
tional safety and health  irrespective of plant safety
 these  were initially designed by osha to be
highly   process hazards  rather than routine
osha  by working with the  representatives of the
committee were able to help osha recognize its lack of expertise to
carry out such a program and then assisted in redrafting the program to
be one that only serves  purposes but is consistent with our
 process safety management 
also in the occupational safety and health  our committee
became aware that a representative of the international textile workers
union had chaired a committee which had completely rewritten the bureau
of labor statistics reporting guidelines for occupational illness and
injury   this  which contained very onerous 
visions for all of  some of which are detailed at the top of
page  in your  had already been approved by the department of
labor and submitted to the office of management and budget  for
approval to  by contacting  we were able to get the
document recalled by the department of labor and then rewritten to
present more balanced guidance on reporting occupational illness and
 this has been followed with extensive contacts with 
including taking the commissioner and member of her staff to tour plants
in our 
representatives of the committee have also been very active with
era in the toxic substances control act  area and have addressed
many of the concerns that surfaced during congressional hearings 
ing assessment and management of 
a dialogue  under the umbrella of the conservation 
 came to agreement on mechanisms for epa management of new 
cals after premanufacturing notification  this issue is a tsca
deficiency that was highlighted during congressional 
cma 

representatives of the tsca reauthorization task group provided the
leadership to bring the  public interest  and
state members of the dialogue group to closure on the  the
 now called  chemical  has been recommended to
epa for  the agency has indicated a willingness to initiate
rulemaking to codify the  thus defusing this concern in future
congressional 
another concern during congressional discussions of tsca was
negotiated  the natural resources defense council  
and epa worked collectively to develop a procedure for negotiating test
agreements and developing test rules under section  the new procedure
was developed under the principle that test rules and negotiated testing
agreements should be equivalent and consent orders under tsca section 
would be the primary mechanism to satisfy that  the consent
 as the test  would include requirements to ensure adequate
and reliable  would be  and would conform to other tsca
regulatory  in  the new procedures would include
an opportunity for public participating and an expedited schedule for
negotiating and  after final agreement by the  involved
 epa will issue the procedures as an interim final rule in
february or march  the result of this successful effort has been
to lower public pressure to amend  precluding what could be more
onerous testing procedures and  it has also improved working
relationships among the  parties involved in the 
the committee has  through the public compensation task 
assisted government relations in recommending and supporting various
initiatives in the superfund reauthorization  these have
included recommending public health surveillance as an integral 
nent of  assisting in preparing lobbying packages opposing
victimsf compensation proposals as these were introduced or 
and communicating the results of the uarep study of possible health
effects from hazardous waste  the superfund bills before congress
have no  demonstration  no federal cause of  and
much better health studies provisions as a 
priority issues which are anticipated to require significant
attention in the future are the 
o
the occupational safety and health administration  has been
relatively inactive in standards development for the last  
few standards have been developed and those that have been 
oped have responded to court mandates or intense legislative
 industry has not had to comply with the new 
but we have missed opportunities to assist in the development of
standards which address workplace needs in a  
osha will not be able to continue being unresponsive to its 
lative  nor is it in  best interest to continue
to miss significant opportunities to assure  
cal workplace 
through its national emphasis  osha has served notice
that our  irrespective of our excellent safety 
cma 

will be more carefully scrutinized for workplace safety and 
we can anticipate  in addition t increased 
chemical plants will be inspected more frequently by  the
health and safety committee is prepared to assist osha where it is
needed and  including considering the development of
some  programs to continue to improve the 

o
in the toxic substances control act   biotechnology
regulation is relatively quiet now but will likely become more
active in the  although it may become a high visibility
 we want to keep it separate from other tsca  we will
continue to monitor work closely with other trade associations and
develop positions as 
reauthorization of tsca has been given a lower priority by
congress for the last  largely because their calendar was so
full of other   this will not 
 we will continue to address the identified concerns and
stand ready to become a player in the debate as soon as it is

a national research council  report stated that the
toxicity data that are available on chemicals in commerce are both
very limited and  many people are now using this report
to show a supposed need for mandatory testing and a minimal test
  no readily available body of data exists to
give a better understanding than is given by the nrc  the
committee will be evaluating the accuracy of the report and what
can be done to improve the data base and refute the  this
is probably a longer term   and not one that lends
itself to relatively early 
o
legislative activities will  especially in the area of the
chemical  effect on the health of the public and our work
 occupational illness had drawn several congressional bills
recently and the proponents of such measures have not been 
ful  the committee is already actively participating in this
debate and will continue in order to prevent our  
tions and products from being unfairly singled out for legislative

public compensation activities will  especially in
the area of product  where we are working with the cma
general   and the government relations staff to
address senator   the superfund reauthorization
battle will be rejoined soon and health effects from hazardous
waste sites will continue to be one of the emotional leaders in
this  the public compensation task group will continue to
play an important role in this 
the issue of health effects from emissions from operating
facilities will come more to the  the environmental 
ment  assisted by the health and safety  has
cma 

been developing a position on  congress and the regulatory
agencies vlll   to use public health as the
driving force for more legislation and regulation addressed at the
chemical  the health and safety committee will continue
to develop health policy for the association and to assist other
committees and departments to respond to issues in the public
health 
the health and safety committee has been   and
nurtured during a very trying time for the chemical  we
believe we he successfully negotiated this traumatic birthing without
losing any  with our goals constantly in front of us and our
eyes on 
f
one of the hallmarks of the  activities has been to try
to address issue in there entirety by going to the heart of the problem
and looking at how legislators and regulators decide to take 
using this  we have addressed the issues in depth and 
posed   not just treated the obvious symptoms and 
ed a cosmetic cure and left the roots of the issue  the
committee intends to continue this approach to the health and safety
issues which will be affecting the chemical industry in the near and

concerning a bilateral

the united states and canada
any bilateral free trade agreement must confer balanced
benefits to both the united states and 
negotiations on the elimination of preferential canadian
chemical feedstock and energy policies and foreign
investment restrictions must be an integral part of any 
tariff negotiations with 
in this  the 
government must not commit itself to any tariff cuts prior
to obtaining canadian agreement to eliminate these
 trade and investment 
other  trade  such as inadequate
protection of intellectual property  should also be
considered in any free trade negotiations between the united
states and 
the tariff elimination components of a bilateral free trade
agreement between the united states and canada should
include all chemicals and related products and should not be
restricted to chemical industry subsectors or specific

the  government should consult with the  chemical
industry and provide adequate opportunities for timely
industry input before and during  negotiations with

any free trade agreement should require that all products
eligible for  entry into the united states under
the agreement must have a canadian value added level of 
percent or  with an unlimited allowance permitted
for the value of  
a bilateral free trade agreement with canada should provide
for the mandatory reimposition of duties in the event of
 of the conditions of the 
any bilateral free trade agreement with canada should
contain an adequate and binding dispute settlement

free trade negotiations with canada should also address
other  such as how temporary trade distortions caused
by currency fluctuations and injury to a domestic industry
by  entry of products will be  to avoid
impairment of the benefits under any bilateral free trade

the elimination of preferential canadian chemical feedstock and
energy policies and foreign investment restrictions must be an
integral part of any  free trade negotiations with

 we believe that other  trade  such
as inadequate protection of intellectual property  should
also be considered in any free trade negotiations between the two

cma is aware that the administration is evaluating the
merits of the possible establishment of a subsectoral free trade
arrangement with canada on 
 the
canadian chemical industry has proposed that any such
negotiations address only certain products in the petrochemical

cma is opposed to any chemical industry product or
subsectoral 
 we believe that any tariff
negotiations with  coupled as indicated above with
negotiations on   must address all chemicals
and related 
to ensure the effectiveness of the tariff elimination
component of a free trade agreement with  any such
agreement should require that all products eligible for 
entry into the  states under the agreement have a canadian

the united states and canada are each  largest

the total trade between the two countries in

chemical trade represents a
substantial portion of this

exports to the united states were about   and united
states chemical exports to canada totalled

the chemical industry of each country has substantial direct
investment in the other

united states and third country 
in  the strengths of the  and canadian chemical
industries complement each 
canada has a rich base in

 specific comments
any bilateral free trade agreement must confer balanced
benefits to both the united states and 
cma believes that the benefits of any bilateral agreement
must be  one country must not benefit to the
detriment of the 
the statutory  such
agreements supports this 
section  of the trade
act of  as amended by section  of the trade and tariff
act of 
indicates that such negotiations should be
conducted on the basis of 
 the legislative
history of the  act states the intention of congress that
bilateral agreements of the sort proposed with canada must be
 and mutually  
 as amended by section   of the trade and tariff
cma 
any free trade agreement with canada must address
 barriers to 
negotiations on the elimination of preferential canadian
chemical feedstock and energy policies and foreign
investment restrictions must be an integral part of any free
trade negotiations with 
cma believes that the negotiations between the united states
and canada on a bilateral free trade agreement should not be
limited to the subject of 
the elimination of
trade distortions caused by preferential canadian chemical
feedstock and energy policies and by canadian foreign investment
restrictions must also be adequately addressed in such

 we believe that the  gov rnment
must not commit itself to eliminating any tariffs prior to
obtaining canadian agreement to eliminate the trade distorting
effects of these restrictive 
ample support for the
inclusion of  barriers in such negotiations is found in
the trade act of  and the trade and tariff act of  
sections   and  of the trade act of  
cma 
canadian raw  and energy policies
cma believes that the internal energy policies implemented
under the canadian national energy policy
 have had an
adverse effect on market mechanisms in canada and on canadian
trade with the united states in   such as

we understand that the cnep is under review by the
canadian government and is likely to be 
in any  as
part of a bilateral free trade  we urge that the united
states government ensure that present and future canadian
 feedstock   and access policies do not
serve as a barrier to otherwise fair 
this is necessary to avoid the  or  of
an artificial advantage for the producers of one country over
those of the 
such an assurance is particularly important
to  such as the petrochemical  for which
feedstock pricing and availability are critical because the cost
of feedstocks represents the largest element of cost for many
petrochemical 
if the trade distorting effects of the
canadian  policies with respect to the supply and
price  and access  petrochemical feedstocks are not
 then those canadian policies will largely determine
the conditions of competition in international trade in
petrochemicals between the united states and  undermining
the workings of an open market 
cma 
canadian investment policy
the united states government must address differences in
investment policy between the united states and canada to ensure
that  companies wishing to invest in the canadian chemical
industry are not subject to different or more stringent
requirements than are canadian investors in 
in  a general agreement on tariffs and trade 
panel found the canadian foreign investment review act  to
be in violation of gatt article iii because fira made approval
to
e
invest in canada contingent upon a foreign  acceptance
of often onerous performance requirements to which domestic
canadian investors were not 
we understand that the canadian government has begun to
administer fira in a less restrictive manner and that the
canadian parliament has passed the  canada  as
  
while this new legislation is supposed to
liberalize the requirements imposed on foreign  s v ral
restrictions will  especially on foreign acquisitions of
existing canadian 
it remains to be seen how the new
act will be

cma 
in any  cma urges the united states government to seek
the elimination of discriminatory canadian investment
 other than those dealing with national 
prior to finalizing a  agreement with 
other  trade  such as inadequate
protection of intellectual property  should also be
considered in any free trade negotiations between the united
states and 
there is growing recognition in the united states and abroad
that the effective protection of intellectual property rights is
essential to increased innovation and productivity and is a vital
part of international trade 
provisions aimed at
encouraging such protection in other countries are contained in
the trade and tariff act of  
the topic is being included
in numerous bilateral trade and investment  and
efforts are underway by some industry groups to have intellectual
property rights included in a new round of multilateral trade

in this  cma urges the united states government to
address the issue of protection of intellectual property rights
as part of any free trade negotiations with 
canada has
traditionally recognized the importance of providing such
and        and

 some problem areas  for  in

we believe that a free trade agreement
with canada should include a resolution of these  as well
as provisions eliminating any other  trade barriers
that may 
the tariff elimination components of a free trade
agreement with canada must be 
the tariff elimination components of a bilateral
free trade  the united statesand canada
skould include all chemicals and related products and not be
restricted to chemical industry subsectorsor specific

a key issue in the  negotiations is whether
import duties or tariffs will be eliminated  the  or
only on specific industry   or 
cma is opposed to any chemical industry product or subs ctoral

 we believe that tariff negotiations with
canada must address all chemicals and related 
we
believe such broader negotiations offer greater potential for
mutual trade 
cma 
any free trade agreement with canada should require that all
products eligible for  entry into the united states
 agreement must have a canadian value added level incluctinqr the value of  origin  of at least
 percent of the value of the 
a minimum level of  value  must be a
condition for  entry into the united states under a
bilateral free trade agreement with 
this criterion would
be fully consistent with the goal of enhanced  trade
and would help to prevent potential abuses of a special trade
relationship through transshipment 
the value added
threshold must be high enough to prevent products of third
countries being passed through canada to the united states after
only formulation or minor finishing operations have been
performed in 
cma urges that the minimum domestic canadian value added b
set at  percent of the appraised value of the product at the
time of  rather them the  percent required under the
generalized system of  the caribbean basin economic
recovery  and the proposed bilateral free trade agreement
with 
a higher percentage is necessary in an agreement
with canada because canada is not a developing country and should
not be given the liberal domestic value added requirements that
have been granted as a concession to such 
in
 cma recommends that the value of  origin raw
materials or other components incorporated into a canadian
product in canada be considered to be canadian value added for
purposes of the  percent test to promote bilateral 
cma 
a free trade agreement with canada should provide for the
 reimposition of duties in  of
 of the conditions of the 
any  bilateral free trade agreement should
include a  provision under which united states import
duties eliminated under the agreement automatically return to
column  rates if the conditions of the free trade agreement are
no longer 
for  if investment restrictions
were reimposed by canada or if canada imposed a new 
barrier to   then the duties on imports from canada
should 
free trade negotiations with canada should also address
other  such as how temporary trade distortions caused
by currency fluctuations and injury to a domestic industry
by  entry of products will be  to avoid
impairment of the benefits under any bilateral free trade

two difficult subjects that cma believes must also b
addressed in the context of bilateral free trade negotiations
with canada are how to handle temporary trade distortions caused
by currency fluctuations and what to do if a domestic industry is
injured by the  entry of products under an 
consideration should be given to imposition of a surcharge to
correct the temporary trade distortions in the first instance and
to imposition of temporary safeguard duties to eliminate the
injury in the 
in this  cma assumes the 
unfair trade statutes will continue to apply to imports fr m

cma 
any bilateral free trade agreement with canada should
contain an adequate and binding dispute settlement

cma believes that any bilateral free trade agreement with
canada should contain procedures for the settlement of disputes
between canada and the united states that arise under the

we do not believe that the procedures contained in
the proposed  agreement are adequate for this

 we recommend that dispute settlement procedures in
any  
settlement of

contain mechanisms for a binding
decision in the event of a   most 
provide for significant industry input in the dispute settlement

the  government should consult with the 
chemical industry and provide adequate opportunities
for timely industry input before and during 
negotiations with 
as mandated by the trade act of  and reaffirmed in th
trade agreements act of  
a structure of formal industry
sector advisory committees  representing  companies
from all segments of  business is in

cma 
widespread perception that the isacs were not advised or
consulted adequately in the course of developing the 
free trade agreement nor in earlier and subsequent 
government discussions with mexico which led to the signing 
the  subsidies 
cma strongly urges the
 government to avail itself fully of this mechanism for
eliciting private sector input on a timely basis if any
consultations on a  bilateral agreement 
 we believe that appropriate mechanisms must exist
to allow for additional industry  such as from cma and
other trade  into any such negotiations so that all
significant considerations can be addressed prior to any
commitments having been 
conclusion
cma believes  if the issues raised in this paper are
considered by the united states government before negotiations
with canada begin and are adequately addressed in any free trade
agreement with  then trade benefits mutually advantageous

of tha localized nature of groundwatar use and the land use considerations tied

 jacobson provided an update   on the chemnet program and
the need to expand participation in the program beyond the  companies currently
 he indicated that the chemnet system had been triggered  times in
the past  months and those incidents all appeared to be well  although
liability had been a major concern inhibiting the participation of some 
the first  experience did not result in any litigation against a chemnet

priority for the next  years will be worker health and safety issues such as
the adequacy of workplace  inspection  chronic disease
detection and compensation 
following    there was general discussion of
these issues with particular attention to osha and the enforcement of the bureau of
labor statistics  guidelines for reporting  it was agreed that the
need for all member companies to utilize the bls guidelines was still critical and
that another communication to the membership on this matter was  the
advisability of an  visit with the labor  leadership

air toxics survey
 berryman presented an overview of the environmental management
 progress on implementing the  air toxics 
 ring presented the interim results   of the survey on the
status of implementation by the membership of the air  his report is
attached as exhibit  through january   responses had been received and
 was continuing with the other   major needs identified in the
survey were a better understanding of the program and its objectives within the
 and additional support for member companies in the area of communications
with the plant community and the public  smaller companies requested a
prioritization of recommended activities and some sense of what a recommended
company program should    conclusion from the survey and the ongoing
analysis of the emc group was that substantial progress had been made but that it
 yet sufficient to meet the programs 
following    there was general discussion regarding
the survey and the overall implementation of the  board members
who
had not yet responded to the survey were urged to do  the importance of a good
response from the membership on the  implementation was also  it
was suggested that the responses be portrayed as representing a percentage of the
total sales of the  and staff agreed to explore this

had been a quiet year with no major policy issues to  he  
raise one important issue for board 
on  duly made and  it was
 that executive contacts of member
companies be encouraged to place their joint
efforts on individual products 
 under the aegis of a trade 
the importance of the trade association umbrella for both individual

 a summary of his report is included as exhibit  key issues addressed
in  were the pending trade legislation and the mtn under  both of which
will carry over into  in  the  free trade negotiations are
also expected to move ahead rapidly this  he indicated that more companies
should get involved in  trade  because the association needs their
input on key issues and because the association can substantially assist member
companies with their specific trade 
regional executive contact meetings
chairman clark made a preliminary report on the six regional executive
contact meetings hosted by  officers during december and january in the
following     new york  and  he

my comments are directed to trade policy   this morning  and what i believe to be our   hopefully   they
will  with   cma international trade committee

i wish my report this morning had better 
 on trade matters   we continue to lose 
unfortunately 
our tctal industry sales   to overseas markets   and produce
another is    as an industry   we are one of 
major international  only agriculture   and electronic
 compare with our industry   in international trade

in washington   both the executive and legislative branches of
government   have become mere interested in trade during the past
 but the resulting patchwork quilt of initiatives is confused  nd   in some instances   counterproductive  tax 
seme bills   to be sure   are  others  unfortunately   run the gamut from political posturing   to
downright foolish  we cannot assume that wisdom   or
common sense   will carry the  just look at the democratic tax
bill   as the latest example   of how badly our industry has been

furthermore   in the marketplace    seeing the emergence
of powerful new competitors   different competitors than we night
have envisioned only a few years 
the gulf states oil producers no longer hold world users on a
short  today they have abundant cheap feedstocks   new lowcoast production capacity   and plenty of incentive   to sell a
lot of  petrochemicals in our  that incentive
grows daily as the price of that oil barrel  we were all too
clearly reminded of this by saudi planning minister hisham nazir at
 october 
if you follow trade statistics   you know that the  has
had an increasing merchandise trade deficit since  in   and this is rough because all the numbers  been totted up  it looks as if tha trade deficit will be over    up at
cma 

least  from   as recently as    we had a
manufacturing trade surplus of 
notwithstanding this national disaster   our chemical industry
still achieved a statistical trade surplus   estimated to be  for  although we seem to be holding our own in chemical
exports   an estimated  in    chemical imports
have been increasing rapidly   by about  per year since 
they reached a record  last year   and the  share
of world trade   declined for the  straight 
in other words   our industry trade surplus has dropped by
almost 
myron foveaux recently gave his annual public trade
prognostication for   numbers are based on the forecasts
  that he obtains from about  of our chemical  he
forecasts our exports will be flat in    despite the weakening
of the dollar   and that imports will be up about  percent  to about   that will result in another  percent
decline in our trade surplus for the year   to about  
increasing share of our markets at home   to 

lest we draw consolation from the fact that we have any trade
surplus at all    dissect its  a trade surplus  means that the sales of our exports   exceed the sales of imported
chemicals sold in the  as you know   sales alone  mean
much if your pockets are empty at the end of the trading 
i believe our trade picture   is alot gloomier than our
projected  billion surplus  if we had a way to
calculate a trade profitability balance   the net effect of
chemical exports versus imports   on our aggregate bottom line  would it still be a  i doubt 
cn the export side of the ledger   i suspect a lot of
companies are exporting near costs   to preserve or build 
consider the comment by imc president george kennedy   in the new
york times last january    maintained   or in some cases
of our profitability    another   had to cut them
  in order to make up for the strong 
even if the  can sustain a weaker dollar   our exports
still face a myriad of problems   high tariffs   
barriers   subsidized nationalized competitors   cheaper
feedstocks   and our own unique brand of legislative impediments  including the burdensome e st of 
cma 

 but trade means exports   and  and that
increasing import figure   should cause our industry to get cur
antenna 
are we simply being outgunned in our home markets by better
products and productivity  or   are we the victim of overt
and covert subsidies   the largesse of our own gsp system   our
open markets   and the adverse effect of an overvalued 
trade should be a  street   but in many initiatives   both
traffic lanes seem to be coming our 
each of our companies are impacted by foreign competition
 our exports have pretty much  imports are
causing price   and volume ripples   in many of the domestic
 our own government has negotiated away a piece of our
industry   bromine products  t to israel without as ouch as a  the prospect of further concessions   canada  mexico   and a new round of trade talks   are not visible on our

some of our executives have stated   that your companies
cannot tolerate further tariff  
 believe there is a sense within the industry   that past
multilateral trade agreements have not always been mutually equitable
  that our chemical industry has given a lot   without getting
very much in  regardless   the administration is committed
to a further opening of the  market   through both the
bilateral and multilateral   pretty much of a 
 that several key events   broad free trade negotiations
with canada   and a new gatt round   will begin within the next
 months   and  current problems can become our 
problem very 
concerning the future multilateral trade negotiations   i
believe that its not realistic that we oppose an  it will
support the 
we should be assigning our top international people to help
develop sound industry  we need cogent  and we
need allies in other industries   to ensure that our industry will
be fairly treated   and not given up as a sacrificial 
beliave me   this is a very important exercise   as  bromine
producers learned   during the  frae trade 
they were lucky   to at least avoid a precipitous removal of
bromine tariffs    instead   are experiencing an extended

the cma board was presented with an international trade
 statement of principles concerning a new gatt
 al spilnar will discuss the itc position in more 
cma 
these principles art   of course   general   but they contain
some important 
  the elimination of trade distorting practices   subsidies
precedence over tariff reduction  an mtn should be
primarily a  
  trade policy should not be subordinated to our foreign
producers are asked to pay the price   for foreign policy 
  the private sector should not be cut out of the 
  the mtn process should not restrict   the 
bilateral treaty 
  development of a binding dispute settlement process   must
be part of a new  this is  the gatt will continue
to be a weak sister   unless it is given sene 
 should be considered on the basis
of foreign requests   and   under no circumstances   should
they volunteered 
  chemical tariff concessions   should not be made in
exchange for concessions given to another   he are not
in the business of dispensing 
  we also need an investment agreement   which will ensure
that we can situate production   where raw materials availability
or markets  we need to have equal access to local financing
of profits can be  foreign national tax policy   and
investment incentives   should be granted on a national treatment

an intellectual property policy   must be  of
any new  h   is the strength of our industry   our
  if we let it be acquired   without compensation  by foreign competitors   we will be giving away a crucial part of
our 
if you look at these statements in your briefing books   see that each is an important concept   not just a piece of
blue 
trade legislation is the other key international area   with
which we should be  when i talk about trade legislation 
  focusing on  initiatives   changing the importremedy laws   and considering the degree   torvhich natural
resources subsidies should be 
cma 
  there are   of course   many  areas of law  that affect our trade  seme such as foreign corrupt
practices and    which were major causes a few years
bach   are still 
realistically   if we get a single omnibus trade bill   it
will be an  congress was in a dither in  and no
clear trade legislation picture  because  is an election
year   we have a pretty small window   perhaps until june for
something to 
what that bill would finally look like is   the
elements of such a bill   will no doubt be drawn from several
proposals   that were introduced last session and   possibly  from the  own  so far   the administration
has kept its own suggested wording under 
however   some key points to look for 
  general trade competitiveness   several proposals have
been made   to establish a committee or council   to evaluate the
effectiveness of cur trade laws  agreements   or to establish
what the general objective or our trade policy should be   or some
combination of the  the object would be to elevate 
  exchange rates   proposals range from mandatory actions  to achieve exchange rate parity   to congressional statements  a conference should be held   to explore options and
mechanisms   to prevent exchange rate 
variations of a statement   to authorize the administration   to
negotiate in a new mtn  some proposals go as far as to list
detailed negotiating  the house  proposal  alone   addresses  free trade 
 which would allow either congress   the administration  or a private entity   to request an investigation   whether an
industry is being injured due to  unfair trade practices
need not be  the various proposals would require industry  to commit to an adjustment plan   in return for a favorable finding
  would give the president less discretion in overriding itc
findings   and would shorten the processing time for 
really an export  it gives the president the authority  retaliate against unfair foreign trade practices or 
various proposals   would   again   shorten the processing time
  include  as an unfair practice   and would mandate
specific  retaliation measures   against unfair  as
with section    congress wants to tighten these remedies  
cma 

making them more usable by business   and more predictable in their

  intellectual property rights   several proposals want to
tighten the prosecution of violators   and ease the process of
uncovering such  this is particularly important to
pharmaceuticals   and pesticide 
  export finance   house democrats   favor increased
future funding for direct  house republicans   on the
other hand   want treasury and  to have authority to match
mixed 
the other major  issue   and this one may end up
in the omnibus trade package   is the question of whether upstream
subsidies   should be  as first proposed by
representative  gibbons in     companies would be able
to get relief   in the form for countervailing duties   when
imports benefit substantially   from the use of a natural resource
in the manufacturing  benefit would be assumed   when the
natural resource is available to the foreign manufacturers   at a
price  than the export price   or fair market value  whichever is 
this upstream subsidies issue   is a real corker for the
chemical industry   we have companies who are strongly on opposite
sides of the 
at cma we have a very active working group   they met quite a
few times   during a relatively short period in  that group
was split right down the middle over this provision of the 

at nam   the same thing happened   right down the 
the international trade pendulum   has swung totally in the
opposite direction since  our main concerns at the beginning of
the decade   were export oriented   offensive  now the
issues are primarily import oriented   defensive measures designed
to protect our domestic 
like the patriots last night   we have to get our offense

administration   that all major legislation initiatives   must be
considered in light of how they affect our trade 
the tax initiative   superfund   export of hazardous substances
balanced against their trade effects   which translate directly
into

focal point   for the  key chemical groups i mentioned earlier

trade policy activities in the

market access restrictions often take the form of high tariffs
used to protect relatively inefficient local 
access

foreign countries to produce the product in that country or lose
exclusive rights to the 
in such  the patent owner is sometimes prohibited from
importing the patented product into that country when a local
producer decides to make it  and is also prohibited from
collecting royalties from that 
section  of   trade law authorizes the president to
retaliate against the unfair practices of foreign governments or
instrumentalities which harm    but  only applies
to  iff barriers which violate international trade

 program overview and outlook
this report marks the second year chac che health and safety
committee has reported to  board of directors since january 
when the board consolidated two standing committees and two special
executive committee task groups into this standing 
considerable effort was made in last  report to describe the
functional matrix adopted by hsc organization chat was put in place to
handle the diverse kinds of  safety and compensation issues chac
confront the chemical industry  the issues we saw this past year
tested the  and our positive results indicate that it
functioned 
in  the health and safety committee was faced with
significant legislative threats contained in the federal superfund and
worker notification  both proposed requirements that would
dramatically change the future course of chemical  
safety and compensation  the superfund bills drafted in early
 would have required specific process safety systems in chemical
 extensive reporting of chemical mass balance  and
broad expensive health programs for people with little or no
significant  in  a federal compensation system with
changes to state tort lavs was  it would have greatly
expanded  liability 
the superfund amendments signed into lav reflect marked
 in part due to  substituting a more sound
 this approach typifies the  method of
advocating chemical company positions before congress and 
the title iii requirements that ultimately passed has narrower
reporting  builds on the osha hazard communication
 and embodies  community awareness and emergency response
  it leaves existing tort lav  does not provide
for a new administrative compensation  and creates a
 assessment program consistent with sound chemical industry
practices used  all in  the results of the 
priority attention and its approach to these portions of superfund
reauthorization yielded significant benefits results to our 
legislation to classify workers in high  groups was
successfully postponed during  the gaydos and metzenbaum worker
notification bills were not taken up by the  congress for final
 the health and safety conmlttee articulated flaws in
the  approaches and impacts on workplace health  and
argued for expanding existing requirements of  hazard
communication standard 
success in postponing these two legislative initiatives resulted
from strong teamwork among the  task  but equally
 among the members of other departments and 
close coordination with government  legal and communications
department staffs and company representatives was essential in the
success of our program alternatives in the legislative 
cma 


while the committee gave legislative initiatives a high priority
in  it devoted most of its effort to responding to government
regulatory  here  the health and safety committee
employed a strategy of recommending better alternatives to proposed
regulations to improve the final  with the occupational
safety and health  for  the conaittee worked
closely with the agency to develop better occupational injury and
illness reporting  it was also able to work with osha to
improve its records inspection program and citation policy through a
collaborative  educational program on recordkeeping for cma
 by working with the agency to identify its program needs and
concerns and advocating our   the couittee was able to
defuse the troubling osha policy on recordkeeping finss that began with
the unprecedented  million fine at  west 
at  the cooiblctee focused on the  unbending conviction
that chemical  in  have insufficient toxicological
testing to evaluate their risk to health and the  the
agency also believed that the regulatory process under the toxic
substances control act  was too blow and cumbersome to address
adequately the  environmental interest groups concurred with
 in evaluating this  hsc looked at how it might resolve
basic concerns about the tsca program without unfavorable congressional
changes to the  it concluded that participating in an informal
dialogue group with all interested parties could successfully lower the
 the approach  resulting in consensus agreements on
negotiated testing and  reporting for  in
 the process of informal discussion allowed traditional
chemical industry antagonists to gain a better understanding of our
concerns and  it has opened communication channels further with
the environmental interest groups and epa  informal dialogue
with traditional opposing parties remains an important committee
advocacy 
while the conaittee sought to gain understanding from interest
groups and agency  it spent considerable effort in communicating
to cma  it initiated  newsletter on health and
safety  which has quickly become  reading for corporate
regulatory affairs  periodic informational 
including a program at the annual chemical industry  are
also supported strongly by  in  the committee
significantly increased the number of  seminars and
roundtables that it  topics included caer 
process safety  and drug control programs for the 
about a dozen such meetings gave cma members invaluable information
about governmental  member company  methods for
protecting workers and the  and operating facilities 
meeting program needs of other parts of  organization has
also been a committee  close ties with the distribution and
environmental management  for  is essential for
maintaining consistency in our health and safety policies for the
 many of the challenges facing these committees are driven by
the  concern about health effects from exposure to substances
chat we transport or release into the  hsc believes it is
essential that we avoid inconsistency in our health policy that could
cma 

undermine  credibility and effectiveness as the chief chemical
industry trade    is diligent in
collaborating closely with its cma counterparts and ensuring that
positions on both federal and state regulatory initiatives are
 coordination with  state affairs program is monitored
routinely as a 
a survey of last  committee activities and programs and a
look at what lies ahead indicates the health and safety comittee will
likely direct a majority of its efforts at addressing health 
to help answer comunity  the comittee will place high
priority on the caer  the program has become even more
important to the chemical industry with superfund 
since emergency preparedness programs in consunltles are now required
by  caer serves as a vehicle for community compliance with the new
title iii    it also has created a
useful communications network for  response to ocher local
 such as health impacts of environmental  the caer
  will play an important role in implementing 
air toxics control program at the local level during 
health concerns about  exposure to chemicals in the
workplace has already surfaced as a key issue for the coming  two
bills introduced the first day of the new  congress will sharpen
the  oversight on worker notification and medical
 and could result in new legislation to address workplace
health  the comittee  as a  spend significant
effort in developing and recomending legislative policy on
occupational disease assessment  and  it will
also look for opportunities to recomend the initiation of appropriate
worker health programs that could serve as models for members of the
chemical  or that regulatory agencies have envisioned for the
 health concerns will likely be the focus of the debate in tsca
reauthorization this year as  which will also require 
priority 
as has been the case  the bulk of  resources
will be directed toward regulatory  new authority provided to
epa and to the agency for toxic substances and disease registry
in the reauthorized superfund law will greatly expand the 
 much work will be needed to ensure that implementing
regulations are   and not excessively

the remaining bulk of the  regulatory  both
agencies have indicated their intent to step up the pace of their

the comittee is confident that it is organized well to meet the
challenges facing it in  as with most  resources

the air toxics control policy was adopted by the cma board of
directors on january   as part of a long standing
commitment by cma member companies to operate facilities in a
safe and responsible 
since the policy was  the association has taken
significant steps to assist members in their implementation of
the policy and to prepare for legislative advocacy on the

approved a survey of the membership to evaluate where we stand
on the implementation of the  identify additional needs
of members and prepare for the  legislative 
survey
the survey document was sent on october   by  roland
to the  executive contacts asking that the information
be returned by november  
responses have been received with approximately  members not

individual contacts were made with those firms not
 and a second letter from  roland is scheduled to
be mailed early this month requesting a prompt 
the preliminary results of the survey indicate that
o
most responders have a program that tracks the cma
policy and most of those programs existed before the

the programs have been
strengthened since the policy was

executive summary
two primary issues hava surfaced during  relative to the
distribution of chemicals that demand a great deal of attention by the
distribution  these are chemical transportation risk
management and  trade barriers affecting the international
distribution of 
it has become readily apparent that the chemical manufacturing
eoonunity must take a more proactive role in identifying and
compensating for the many variables that influence the safe
transportation of  state and local 
 and congressional oversight committees are among the
many groups that have expressed concern over the potential risks
associated with chemical  the distribution committee
has joined forces with representatives from the railroad and trucking
industries to assess the risks of moving different types of 
during tha upcoming year risk management models will be developed that
individual chemical companies can use to work with their carriers in
identifying the safest possible means of transporting their 
the past year has also brought on a great deal of activity in the
international regulatory arena which has had a significant impact on
the distribution of  the distribution committee has been
instrumental in tha development of marine pollution requirements that
guard against the dumping of chemical wastes at  
because of the distribution  efforts the international
requirements did not go so far as to curtail international chemical
 or make it so expensive for  shippers that they
would be put at a competitive disadvantage with foreign chemical

cma also played a major role in getting   government officials
to intervene in the efforts of foreign governments to reserve cargo to
their nations flag  thus reducing competition and creating a
serious impediment to the safe transportation of 
the national chemical response and information center  has
gone beyond the  expectations in fulfilling the needs of
emergency responders and the public for chemical related 
 which celebrated its fifteenth  has seen a
significant growth in activities over  calls rose from 
inquiries in  to  in  a   chemtrec also
introduced the hazard information transmission system which enables
emergency responders to access hard copy chemical information via a
computer  the chemnet  the  first all
encompassing mutual aid  has continued to grow in size and
importance over the past 
it was recognized by secretary of
transportation elizabeth dole during the  spills conference as a
major industry initiative to assist emergency responders in effectively
handling chemical transportation 
the ncric landing library has also been tremendously 
over  emergency responders have had the opportunity to view the 
 the chemical industry has received countless praise for this
major effort to train emergency responders on the proper techniques for
handling chemical 
the chemical referral center responded to over  inquiries
from the public for  health and safety information about
 an index of approximately  products has been
developed to assist the chemical referral center in quickly identifying
the appropriate companies to refer callers  this service is
expected to continue to increase in importance over the coming year as
states and local communities implement the  provisions of
the superfund amendments and reauthorization 
while a great deal of the distribution  energies were
directed at improving the safe transportation of chemicals during 
the committee continued to promote competition and 
measures for the distribution of  the committee was
successful in getting the interstate commerce commission to overrule
the efforts of a major railfoad to flag out of its common carrier
responsibilities to move certain  the committee also played
a key role in helping to shape practical rules for railroad cost

report of the engineering advisory committee
to the cma board of directors
september  
good   delighted to have this opportunity to talk a
little bit about the engineering advisory  your program book
contains our formal report and i  intend to go over that in 
i will use one or two specific examples from that report to illustrate
some points i would like to make  of  will do my best to
answer any
questions it engenders  or questions arising from anything
 for that  but i would like to editorialize a bit upon the
bare listing of specific activities to leave with you the following 
  major  namely that of dealing with codes and
 is an advocacy  although it is not the type of 
vocacy you
will read about very often on the front page of the new york
 and
it may or may not be dealingwith a government  it is
nevertheless an advocacy not dissimilar to  main 
the second important thought is that cma is uniquely positioned
to perform that  in discussing this   like to take you
through the criteria eac uses in selecting the tasks where that advocacy
is an essential element and lead you to the final   that
the eac activities have a high payout for a very modest 
to those who are not close to standards  it might
seem that setting standards should be a straightforward technical  or
pure science if you  about as controversial as      that the
only problem should be to arrive at the best technical solution to which
all rational experts would readily   would that it were so
it is perhaps appropriate to spend just a few minutes to refresh
our memories on the general framework of the standards  in the
 standards are  or  although in many 
stances one or more governmental jurisdictions give them the force of law
after they are prepared  the national electric code is a classic 
 as a voluntary standard it represents good engineering 
but all or parts of it have also been enacted into law by virtually every
 state and federal governmental body involved with the regulation
of either construction or personal  local building codes to

the umbrella organization for the voluntary standards system is
the american national standards  known as ansi for  ansi
does not write any  what it does do is oversee the consensus
 when   deternrlnes there has been a reasonable opportunity for
all interested parties to voice a contribution and that all valid 
cma 

tions have been either resolved or  it will  the
document as an ansi  there are perhaps  or  thousand of
such ansi  of  i would guess that something in the range
of  to  thousand are of direct or indirect interest to the chemical 

in  there are many standards of interest that have
never gone through the   just to name  the
standard of the tubular exchanger  association or 
which forms the backbone for most of the  shell and tube heat
exchanger  remains as a   not ansi

how then do standards get into the ansi 
there are
several acceptable  the three most comnon   consensus
  accredited organization or  
the consensus
conmittee approach was originally predominant in the ansi 
in
using this  an adhoc committee is  inherently containing
 that  the conmittee members are carefully selected to
represent parties of    
cal  the public and any special  the  
put is subjected to public  and when all negative conments have
been  the document is adopted as a  many of our basic
process industry engineering standards were developed in this 
for   process    ays  
 this mode is gradually shifting over to other  major 
put to the content of such standards must come primarily from 
cipating on the working  at the   has only four
representatives to such  so you can see we have been highly
 over the  member company direct participation has been
high in such activities and still forms the backbone of chemical industry

it is only where member company direct participation cannot
accomplish the goals that cma participation is  most often
this occurs when only  not individuals or companies are
admitted to   say more about this subject a little 
the second procedure recognized by ansi is that of the 
credited  here ansi certifies that the procedures of the
sponsoring organization provide for achieving 
essential
elements include public access to the work and requires broad based 
mittee  notification  rights of 
 and mechanisms to resolve any  many of our most
used standards are developed this  including the asme boiler and
pressure vessel code and our favorite example  the national electric
code which is under the aegis of the national fire protection association
cma 
in many aspects it is difficult to perceive the differences
between the consensus coumittee and the accredited  work on
the nec for example is carried out by    each of
about  members plus an equal number of   
pates on the  panels which most closely affect the chemical industry
 total  provided by member companies at member company
 code panel composition includes representation from equipment
 government  trade  technical 
the building   consumer  metal 
insulation  other trade associations   
the utility industry and probably others i missed as i skinmed the 
the motivations in such a diverse group obviously  there are many
opportunities for honest differences of technical  based on the
diverse perspectives represented  that after  is what the consensus
system is all  but it is also possible for pet  or even
special  to be pressed beyond the point of 
just one  at the last revision of the  certain
interests sought to include a requirement for a motor disconnect switch
physically at each motor  offering as justification the safety of
persons working on the  for most  this is a matter of 
 not so in the process industries where such a local switch
would normally have to be explosion  it is  position that
current tag and lockout procedures on remote disconnect devices provide
demonstrably adequate protection and that the proposal creates greater
safety hazards than the one it is intended to  if the proposal
were  we estimated the cost to cma member companies at  
based on the then current rate of new  although the amount
of new construction  we observe that the normal time interval
between adoption of a
standard for safety applicable only to new 
struction and the first voice
of regulation suggesting retrofit is
generally measured in  in this  no estimate of 
fit cost has been 
one feature of the ansi  intended to minimize 
 is that each standard must be revised or reaffirmed within a 
year  the proposal on motor disconnects was turned back at the
working conmlttee level for both the  and  versions of the 
current activities are
aimed at the   once again the proposal
has failed sufficient committee support for adoption   
 this time appeal has brought it forth for public  
tory to a floor fight at the nfpa  the immediate task at hand
is to encourage sufficient  conment to lay the foundation for a
successful floor fight if it is carried that  the electrical task
group is currently organizing such a campaign among member companies and
other  the nfpa membership assembled in convention is the
cma 
court of ultimate appeal in so far as technical content of the nec is

although members of the nfpa are obviously interested in
 only a small percentage will be technically versed in matters

i think the parallels with other forms of advocacy are

it is also obvious that a single decision does not make a
threat go  like bad  these things keep coming back and 
in addition to the consensus committee and accredited 
zation modes of  there is a third in frequent use  the canvass
 here the document is prepared by   then
submitted for public comment and  all negatives must be 

typical organizations using this approach include the 
writers  the  and our old  the national board of
boiler and pressure vessel  most of the activities from this
source  the exception of the national  are less demanding on
the  per  but do impact on cma  continued 
pation  is a necessary prerequisite to our credibility when
claiming to represent the chemical manufacturing industry in other

let me turn away from the ansi tutorial to the question of how
eac selects its  in a very few  only organizations such as
cma representing identifiable blocks of interest will have  here
 if it is worth  cma should do  the option is 
 there are only seven official cma representatives  two 
 in such 
i mentioned before that the major standards effort comes from
direct member company participation rather than cma  eac
does attempt to track participation in areas of significant interest and
maintain an informal liaison with member company  this contributes
to a broader coverage and less redundant 
where the tracking indicates a lack of coverage in an area of
 we try to encourage some member company to fill the  it
was this gap identification effort that some years ago spotted the fact
that there was no user industry participation on the nec  in this
 the task was so complex that a more formal response was judged to
be needed and a coordinated effort was mounted which has been highly
 the bulk of the effort is still provided directly by member
company  but without the coordination available only through
 the total industry cost to participate would have been much higher
and is unlikely to have been as     member each
on   reps to  the strength of a well thought  unified
industry position has been amply 
cma 
just because  standard is used by the chemical industry does

dimensions of bolt  we  care much about flanges so long as
the flange we will buy next month will mate with the one we bought last

but if there is an effort at significant  as with the
metrication thrust of a few years  even flange dimensions can become
a key  these  come and 
the eac relies primarily on its informal liaison with member
company representatives as well as its own membership to surface the
problem areas which are appropriate for cma  appropriateness
is measured by potential impact on the industry and whether cma is needed
 opposed to member company rep handling the matter with some
 the net result is the very selective direct involvement by the
eac mentioned  but a much wider  impact with both
indirect and direct savings out of proportion to the modest 
i  want to leave you with the impression that looking at a
few standards represents the sum total of eac  response to
pertinent regulation and legislation is a clear  for 
this year we had expected two osha proposals on electric safety 
we were not disappointed when they  issue  but they will be
one of our concerns growing out of several years of arm
wrestling with the national board of boiler and pressure vessel
inspectors and the relatively satisfactory outcome at the national level
is that the arena will shift to the state  the national board 
after  composed entirely of senior state level  and the
state capitals are their natural  the eac has been working with
state affairs  vision to attempt to work  an effective early warning
system that will be both comprehensive and cost  a necessary
adjunct will be the necessary backup and support to the local  if and
as 
the eac has for a number of  sponsored a computer user
 at two year  these educational sessions in a rapidly
moving technology have been extremely well received and are generally

this  in partial response to the bhopal  the eac
undertook to conduct a similar forum on inspection and maintenance and
instructed a newly formed task group to focus on safety through 
tion and maintenance procedures and 
this group will be
holding its third meeting next  and seems well on the way to
creating an informative and constructive 
cma 

for the coining  we 
to continue the programs already in  especially those
related to the nec and the two forums 
we need to continue to strive for a comprehensive and cost
effective mechanism for dealing with state level regulation
of pressure 
in preparation for the storm of regulatory legislation that
in the wake of bhopal and later incidents now seems 
 we need to position the eac to support the
association most  some parts of this can and
will be undertaken at eac   an 
creased interaction with and support to the safety and health
committee seems  but the  by the nature of
the subjects it deals with and the normal working assignments
of its  is essentially a  not a proactive
  the majority of issues needing attention
will necessarily flow from the association to the eac for
supporting contribution  prime 
thank you for your time and

version of eac activities i hope  left you with some key  
e
the whole participation in standards activities is closely
akin to more obvious advocacy initiatives

cobhunications committee report
to cma board
january  
a year ago when john huasey of monsanto gave the

 who  shocked by the tragedy that occurred in india in
december of 
to an industry already under public  this shock added
the eleaents of plant safety and operating coapetence to the
 concerns about 
to deteraine the extent of the
 feelings about  caabridge reports recently
conducted a national opinion 
the results of that survey were not 
without going into all the  the  view of the
cheaical industry was fairly 
we are perceived
as the nuaber one environaental risk to society and the nuaber
report by    aaoco cheaicals  to cma board
of  january  

two safety  with the nuclear power industry ranked as number

more than  percent of those questioned feel that a
 accident is likely to happen in the 
by
overwhelming  the public supports legislation to
create   mandatory emergency  and
buffer zones around chemical 
perhaps one of the more disturbing findings was that  percent
of those polled  so sure that the benefits they get from
chemicals are worth the 
and about  percent of the public
wants more regulation of the chemical industry even if such
regulation results in higher prices for consumer 
 it will cone as no surprise to you that we rank last
among basic industries in terms of public favorablllty  below
even the nuclear power and alcohol 
 not everything the cambridge survey found out was

as an  the public is of mixed emotions as to the role
that perceived corporate greed plays in our environmental

about  percent felt that  just out to make a
buck regardless of the environmental 
yet 
percent disagreed with that 
cma 
 the beet news is that three quarters of the public feels that the
chemical industry is making at least soae effort to ensure that a
 accident  happen in the 
while 
hardly great  it does show that the public is at least
somewhat aware of our excellent safety record and the things
 doing to improve it even 
we also learned that while the public is concerned about spills
and leaks and  they feel that it is the 
health effects that are most 
so as we take steps to
ensure against accidents and  we should not lose track of
the larger issue   that the public is very concerned
about chronic health effects from exposure and use of

realize that there is little opportunity to do something dramatic
to showcase our

with our

reachable target would be a  or a   that gray aiddle ground
of public tolerance that will perait us to operate our businesses
in a reasonable 
the public always will be concerned
about our industry and our 

 have to live with
our goal should be to answer the  fears about us
so that their reasonable concern  translate into extreme
actions
in responding to  the industry wifely steered clear of
progress that would be seen aerely as public relations 
by creating the caer and mcric  cma has given the
industry an activist response that involves an operating
coaaitaent by line 
these prograas are comprehensive
and directed  at the  aajor concerns about the

mot  they also provide an excellent
communications opportunity at the local and state level that we
aust use to our 
the current state of the  aedla relations and
cosaunications efforts is one of those good  news

the good news is that the intense aedia attention to
r
  our business has enabled us to establish reasonably good
relationships with hundreds of media 
to these people as never 
we now have access
the bad  of  is
that it took some tragic events to bring this 
when i say intense media  i mean that 
the
number of media calls fielded by cma in  reached 
 an  percent percent jump from 
at amoco we
received  percent more media calls about our chemicals business
in  than in 
 sure that each of your companies
would report similar 
despite this media attention and despite the negative news items
of  a professional view is that our treatment by the media
could have been a lot 
while each member of the
communications committee can recall a few horror stories from
 we agree  on  the industry received fair

this occurred as a natural result of increased
personal contact between the media and the members of our

in many  our open and candid response during
these negative incidents helped establish credibility with the
media and showed our concern and our 
as a  we have created relationships with some media people
that will be a major communications asset for us in the 
cma 
speaking of  our future communications activities will
benefit from the success of the cma superfund editorial contact

this  in which a number of you 
was a major communications 
it succeeded because cma
adopted a responsible and activist position on superfund and took
that position on the road with great persistence and

the results  in terms of editorials favorable to
 position  were nothing short of 
the
editorial contact program also proved once again that the
 greatest communications assets are the people in this
room and your peers in other cma member 
to those in
the  you are the chemical 
 to answer the question  things getting better with the
 i would have to answer a qualified 
established contacts and 
tfe have
opportunities exist for
substantially improved media coverage of our industry in the

looking to that  the communications committee is convinced
that  communications objectives will be best achieved by
concentrating on solving current problems with current 
while we are concerned about the    we
feel that we can accomplish many of those goals through properly
directed attention to  
cma

we will focus our support on the   especially
now that many of the emergency plans have been prepared and are
ready to take to the 
our october open meeting was a caer 
communications seminar that was very well 
we will
continue to recruit individual companies to actively support caer
communications and we will work with cma staff and the state
chemical councils in their caer 
we have set up a pilot program for communications committee
members to help improve state chemical council communications

three states are in our first batch that will begin
this 
if  this approach could be expanded to
additional states in the 
we will continue to support cma and the cics in their legislative
advocacy 
as   a solid communications program
can help the industry reach its legislative 
we will encourage increased activity by chemical company senior
executives in communications 
you can expect us to
continue to come to you with media contact 
and we will promote a rational public dialogue on the subject of
risk 
working with bob  we recently held a
cma 

risk perception seminar for senior communications executives of a
dozen major chemical 
the result was an interesting
exchange of views that should encourage a more informed public
discussion of this important 
before   like to make two recommendations to you as
senior executives of your individual 
the first recommendation relates to the communications revolution
 seeing in our industry  the people doing much of the
communicating are not  professional 
the middle ranks in our companies are being subjected to media
attention as never  particularly your plant 
terminals for use with aluminum  copper  cma objected to

january  
patents have long been recognized as an effective
stimulant to ingenuity and technology innovation in the
united  after decades of benign  patent and
other industrial property rights have again been recognized

receiving increased attention in the  dealing
with our economy and the competitiveness of  industry
with foreign  during the last ten years much
legislation and other  including the establishment
of a federal patent appeals  have already been
 these actions have strengthened the 
patent  but much remains to be  many of these
actions generally impact on the chemical  and some
are specifically directed to 
in reviewing  i would initially like to mention
three significant developments in the patent  the
first is the precedent set in the recent 
decision in which the courts refused to stay an injunction
in a patent case during the appeal  whether one
agrees with the decision in this particular case or 
this decision is a major example of the continuing shift in
the judiciary to a   the  i
might  took no action in respect to this  but
the decision is notable in what it 
 the  government instituted an
investigation under section  of the  trade act
against south  the government is looking into the
adequacy of the laws of south korea governing the protection
of industrial property rights and the effect of such laws on
 trade in that  through this  and
various other recent actions in the international trade
 the government is demonstrating its concern with
unfair practices in the industrial property field by trading

the third is the effort initiated in various sectors
toward harmonization of international patent procurement law
cma 
and  this represents a concerted effort by
governments and business to  simplify and reduce

che chemical  the chemical industry would be a
direct 
it would give chemical producers
additional protection against foreign competitors who use a
process abroad that is patented in the  and who then
import into the  products made by that  the
failure of current  law to have such protection is
considered inequitable because most other developed
countries have such a provision and  producers are thus
placed in an unfair competitive position in international
 although some relief is now available against
importation of such products through the international trade
 that remedy has problems which this patent law
change would 
industrial property rights are fast becoming a key issue
in the international trade  the government has
recognized that american companies have a vital interest in
protecting their proprietary positions abroad and that the

reported their superfund  but did not file their report until over
a month  this created delay since it was necessary for the
principal  energy and  and public works and 
along with merchant marine and  and  to reach agreement
on a compromise package which would be offered for floor  this
  consumed most of  and it was not until
december  chat agreement had been reached and all were able to meet with

package that relied principally upon a superfund excise tax similar

superfund taxing proposals got caught up in the debate on the budget
reconciliation  senator packwood  chairman of the senate

several days this bill moved back and forth between the senate and the
house with each party rejecting the superfund funding proposal of the ocher

the
hazardous
materials
transportation act
problem
the federal government has been losing the strong central authority
to regulate the movement of hazardous 
an increasing
number of state and local rules now restrict the free flow of these

such restrictions are manifested in many different
 
   equipment
 driver licensing and hazard 
in exchange for giving up their right to impose local fees to support state
and local response capabilities to transportation emergencies 
volving hazardous materials and other operation  state
and local governments are demanding funding to improve their response
to transportation incidents involving hazardous 
qbj active
strengthen the hmta to give dot the ability to quickly review and rule
on local and state ordinances that impede the interstate movement
of 
improve the ability of communities to plan for and
respond to hazardous materials transportation 
such
improvements should not be funded with a new 
 but rather should take into account private initiatives
such as ncric and caer to respond to state and local 
background
the hazardous materials transportation act  was originally
passed in  and reauthorized in  and again in 
in the
last round of hearings on the hmta  industry pressed
for national uniformity of 
this was strongly opposed by
representatives of state and local government unless industry agreed
to address their concerns about local emergency response
 a  congress refused to take a substantive
position addressing   or those of 

following the  hearings a coalition of industry and
state and local representatives was formed to forge consensus
modifications to the hmta that preserve the  interest in the
free flow of commodities between states and that address the needs of
 jurisdictions to respond adequately to hazardous materials

unfortunately this coalition adopted the position that a
special fund based on an industry tax should be included in the hmta
t
pay for training and equipment for  local hazardous materials
 rgency response 
the fund was estimated at  million
cma 
dollars but chat is unrealistically low if equipment is included in
the fund 
we are concerned that the new taxes would also
be directed at the   rather than the whole hazardous
materials transportation 
we are also concerned that soae
states or localities would refuse to accept aoney froa a federal fund
and elect to initiate their own tax on 
 the fund concept is supported by this 
 the national hazardous materials technical advisory
coaaittee  advisory coaaittee to  the  the aaerican

support reauthorization of the hmta in this 
the

at the same time we would support efforts to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal government in
providing training for local agencies to respond to hazardous
materials 
the federal program should recognize the
contribution of voluntary industry 
oppose the institution of another fund to provide training and
equipment for emergency responders on the basis that the training
is generally available and could be readily augmented by federal

relative to the reauthorization of hmta
there are generally twelve  baing considered by tha national

hazardous materials coalition for amending tha hazardous matarials
transportation 
these twelve areas and tha recommended direction
cma should take on them are as 
hazardous materials regulations must be uniform
cma supports the recommendation that the regulations
governing the transportation of hazardous materials
should be nationally 
differing regulations
at tha  state and local levels for such
transportation are counterproductive to the safe
movement of hazardous 
while the existing language of the hazardous materials
transportation act clearly authorizes the secretary of
transportation to preempt inconsistent state and local
 the process for obtaining such a ruling
has not worked to the satisfaction of  
dustry or the 
dot  
should not be overturned by courts unless found to be
arbitrary and 
dot should consider both the
 criteria and the  criteria

these changes to the inconsistency
process will reduce the time and expense associated with

to the benefit of    industry and
ultimately to the benefit of 
cma agrees with the recommendation that congress should
clearly define the specific roles of  state and
local governments regarding the development of hazardous
materials transportation 
in an effort to
achieve a nationally uniform regulatory scheme the federal
 through  should be solely responsible for
promulgating hazardous materials transportation regulations

state and local regulations should only be promulgated in

believes that state and local government should have the
primary responsibility for enforcing these national
hazardous materials transportation 
 data base and regional flow patterns
cma agrees with the recommendation that a data base sh uld
be established to determine the regional flow patterns for
hazardous 
he further agree that such information
should be limited to what is necessary for determining the
appropriate level and placement of emergency response 
ing and 
it is important that the information 
quired for the development of this data base is limited to
those hazard classes and materials that have the greatest
potential for causing

hhile cma wholeheartedly agrees that the public must
be aware of their role when an accident occurs involving
hazardous  we further believe that there should
be a shared  responsibility to let the
public know what safeguards and mechanisms currently exist
to minimise the potential for problems associated with the
transportation of hazardous 
the actual 
ment of industry in this  which is extremely 
should be conveyed as a part of this public awareness

programs that are designed to meet this 
these

been very progressive in assisting emergency response
officials in the development of contingency plans and in
making detailed support information and equipment readily

we intend to continue of efforts in this

movement of hazardous materials to embark on similar safety

cma would not object if  for good  decided to
exercise its current statutory authority to establish a
registration program for shippers and carriers of hazardous
 as well as manufacturers of containers for
hazardous 
in determining the need for a

essential for state and local enforcement personnel to

cma supports the recommendation that all states should enact
good samaritan legislation to protect the liabilities of
those responding to emergencies involving hazardous

enactment of such legislation is essential to
enhance industry response to emergencies involving

in the industry
the chemical industry is committed to providing technical
assistance to  state and local officials that are

we believe these programs should limit the

emergency response 
we welcome other sectors

programs and communicating their 
right to know
cma agrees that it is  responsibility to provide

the cma international trade consnittee seeks to emphasize three
issues in a new 
these individuals today are more willing and capable of
representing your companies and our industry than ever 
 also clear to the committee that many companies are now
placing increased value on communications skills when senior
management selects the people to serve as your plant 
on the media relations front in  the committee felt that we
generally received fair  our relationships with
environmental reporters for many major media were further
strengthened during the  familiarity breeds respect in this
  and we had another year to increase our 
credibility with these  in  all of our skins
got a little bit thicker in  as the industry learned anew
that working with the media is a   and sometime
frustrating part of all of our  as a  our collective
tolerance level with the media is even higher than it  we
have learned that no one story or single episode is critical and
that  the long term results that count in working with the

as a result of these and other efforts in  the 
opinion of our industry  at least if you believe the
public opinion  i  go into all the  but
i think a few trends are worth 
according to one prestigious national  the  view
of our industry improved  our approval rating in this
survey increased by about  percent during  
fairness requires me to point out that we started the year dead
last among   with a rating so low that any
improvement would seem large by  this 
though  moved us from  place to about  or  on
cma 
the industry   above the alcohol and nuclear power
industries and very close to the electric utility  now
our standing  begin to compare with the ratings of the
 computer industry or the food and retailing 
but we moved up a notch or two and our ranking is the highest
 been since  that has to qualify as good 
this survey showed two other items of special  
in a special  the plastics industry received an
approval rating that would place it at about  place on the
  since many of the companies here today have
some interest in  this approval rating should be

  the oil  which for years had been in the
  improved  in  the oil guys
were in last  by the fourth quarter of  oil had moved
all the way up to about the middle of the   so
major improvement is possible if we 
other results from other surveys show mixed results  either the
 opinion about us stayed the same or improved only
 we seem to be rebounding slowly from last 
 
yet we should not confuse these slight improvements with any
lessening of the  concern about the environment and our

survey after survey continue to show that the american people
place environmental concerns very high among their 
even to the point of preferring the environment over jobs or
higher prices when faced with a choice in the 
the public feels that the environment is  but feels
that the improvement has been progressing too slowly and that
nobody  business or government  is acting quickly 
the public continues to rank the disposal of hazardous wastes as
its number one environmental concern and cites the chemical
industry consistently as the  primary source of air and
water 
faced with these  the communications  
objectives reflect our enthusiasm to support  advocacy
efforts and the opportunity to parlay these  where
 into improved communications with the public at 
heading our project list for  is the followup on our caer
communication achievements of  if there is a cma member
plant that  yet conducted a caer communications 
we want to find it and get it on track with the rest of the

cma 
caer has been the leadership effort for the chemical industry
during this decade and we must not let it wither  either in an
operating or a communications  the  greatest
fear is that our plant people will become complacent about caer
now that they have gone through all the effort of establishing it
in their  pardon the  but caer will require a
lot of tender loving care in the future if it is to continue as
the  flagship health and safety 
another of the many values of caer is that it gives us the
opportunity to deal from strength in conducting our future
communications activities at the plant  with this in 
the committee and cma staff are building on  success in
tackling the  two upcoming communications hurdles 
air toxics and the implementation of the title iii provisions of

in the air toxics  a survey of the committee found that most
of the companies intend to treat their air toxics communications
as an extension of the caer 
 we should realize that the air toxics issue presents
some communications barriers that are quite different from our
caer 
for one  chemical plants in a community usually produce
widely differing product  so while one plant can boast to
the local media about its relatively clean products and lack of
toxic air  a neighboring plant manager may have a devil
of a time explaining why he  comment about chronic air
emissions of his   remember too that most
of these same plants worked closely together in introducing the
 caer program to the  the unified local approach that
worked so well with the caer program also could suffer when
different plants are at different stages of implementing their
air toxics 
another concern is that many plant managers understandably are
reluctant to be as aggressive in promoting the air toxics issue
as they were with  the reason is  admitting to
chronic air emissions of toxic chemicals is not a pleasant 
and in some cases managers are not in a position to comment about
the  effects of exposure to these 
in overcoming these  the communications  cma
 and your local managers will carry out a comprehensive and
effective communications   already held our first
air toxics communications workshop  earlier this month in
 it was well  including many plant 
and many important questions were  we do plan to be a bit
cautious in our approach to this communications  and i
hope you agree with our 
cma 
w also plan to build on the caer communications success in
helping local plant people cope with the title iii provision of
 these provisions will require your plants to make
more information available about your products and processes than
ever  it will all be available at once and it will be
available to anyone who wants  already some environmental
groups have shown what they can do to embarrass us with our own
information taken out of  the committee has formed a
separate task group that will help us formulate our
communications policy in this 
our final major objective in  is to continue to assist the
state chemical councils in improving their communications
  already have made important progress in
  and new jersey and  be working with
more states in the 
this  activity becomes more important when you realize
that  legislation will expand from california
to many other  the cics so far have been receptive to our
help and we plan to continue this 
so our  agenda will consist of four major 
following up on caer  extending our communications
activities to cover the air toxics and title iii  and
working with the  these objectives are in  of
 to our ongoing work with other committees within cma to
provide communications counsel and  help as 
the committee feels that these goals are achievable with current
manpower and with current 
i would like to close with a comment that  fall readily
into our normal communications 
the committee feels that we should be wary of the recent attacks
on the   of major   while
 too early to call this a major  there are a lot of
people cut  including some in the current 
who may well be taking shots at  
executives could be blamed for everything from working too hard
on their golf game to operating bloated and inefficient
organizations to sacrificing the   future for
the sake of their friends in the executive 
along these  gm may be the first company to enter this
 that    the perot 
the wave of midwest plant  and a weak product slate have
combined to focus public and media attention on the personal
capabilities of those managing the giant auto 
cma 
while gm may be the  we  be fooled into thinking
the  attention will stop  this is a trend 
all have to watch very 
in   saw the chemical  reputation with
the public improve for the first time in several  this
uptick did not come about by  it occurred because we
operated  moved aggressively to meet the 
legitimate concerns about our  and took the time to
tell people what we were 
through caer and other programs we showed a lot of confidence in
the american public last  maybe  beginning to return
that  i hope 
we look forward to earning your continued support throughout

waste minimization program
purpose of executive committee and board of directors review
the environmental management   ad hoc task group on
waste minimization presented a status report describing the vaste
minimization  importance and a possible cma program at the
november board of   the purpose of this review is
to obtain approval of a recommended cma 
background
the  amendments to the resource conservation and recovery act
 require companies to establish voluntary waste minimization
programs and certify  several states have in place or are
developing legislation requiring vaste  company waste
minimization efforts are also being scrutinized when permits for
waste facilities are  alternatives for stronger federal
action are discussed in recent reports to congress by the office of
technology assessment and  applying greater pressure to force
waste minimization appears to be a high priority for public interest
 this goal is reflected in various thrusts toward achieving
zero discharge and opposition to siting new treatment and disposal

the progress that industry has made in implementing voluntary waste
minimization programs will be evaluated by congress in hearings
beginning in  if industry cannot demonstrate sufficient
progresst public interest groups may be able to convince congress to
adopt extreme amendments as part of  reauthorization which is
scheduled in  the amendments could include such undesirable
intrusions into industry operations as limits on waste 
process  and outside 
companies are already confronted with increasing costs of vaste
disposal as epa expands the scope of wastes regulated as hazardous
under  implements further land disposal pretreatment
 and further tightens controls over waste management
 many companies have significantly reduced their

demonstrate industrywide  and  programs are under

waste minimization is likely to be an issue in rcra hearings and

in  epa is committed to improve waste
minimization programs and data bases in  which it must do to
reduce congressional oversight  cma needs to start its
program early in  to provide assistance to epa and to develop an

accomplishments is set forth in qiapter  a swaary of these
accomplishments includes

has actively advocated reauthorisation and appropriate amendment of the full spectrum of enviroimmntal legislation 
 resource conservation and recovery act 
the safa drinking water  clean air  and clean water
 the end result of the  efforts was a comprehensive
amendment of  cma efforts resulted in significant
modifications to the rcra amandsents to make several

impose unjustified restraints on industry operation and
potential growth or those that offer little or no commensurate
environmental  at this  there is a
real likelihood that mendments to the clean water 
 and the safe drinking water act will be enacted
this 
o one of the key elements of  haxardous waste management
program is to establish industry trends in member company
hazardous waste disposal  to achieve this 
tive the oic conducted for the third  a survey of
waste disposal practices for  and is managing a similar
survey for  the three year survey results show very
favorable disposal practice  the survey results have
proven to be a vary valuable element in  superfund
legislative and communications  and as a part of the
full spectrum of solid waste advocacy 
o during the past  the rapidly escalating issue of air
toxics has taken up an increased level of activity and has
great significance to the dic and the industry in the past

tax policy committee
executive summary
overview
in  the tax policy committee was very deeply involved in
key legislative issues affecting the chemical  responding
to the numerous problems raised in both tax reform and superfund
reauthorization  the coomiittee responsibly handled a vide
range of tax issues that could increase industry tax costs by more
than  billion 
tax reform legislation
for over two years the tax policy committee has dealt with the
basic issues of tax reform 
in  president reagan
proposed a  shift of over  billion in individual tax
burdens to business  vithin the business  the
 tax program would finance lower corporate and individual
tax rates by repealing the investment tax credit and reducing
depreciation  in  there would be significant
changes in the tax treatment of international business activities
that would substantially increase the tax costs of  
in december  the house of representatives passed  
a bill whose basic tax reform philosophy was in agreement with that
advocated by the   major tax activity in  was
before the senate committee on 
in addition to the issues
identified in the house  cma successfully lobbied the finance
committee to reject several tax proposals that would have had a
disproportionate impact on the chemical  cma also
successfully lobbied the finance committa to include favorable
amendments on the issues identified in the house  chemical
industry losses will be offset in part by more favorable depreciation
treatment and lower corporate tax 
during the   cma supported the senate
  cma successfully lobbied the conferees to reduce the
penalty on depreciation in the alternative minimum  the overall
impact of the tax bill will increase taxes paid by the chemicl
industry over the next   that   is not as
great as the increase other capital intensive industries sustained in
this 
superfund lexislation
the tax policy committee continued to provide technical
assistance in  to the government relations committee on superfund
funding  including broad base tax  this assistance

cma  cma has undertaken the following activities to seek
positive reforms in state tort 
o developed and distributed an issues book that sets forth and
discusses  priority tort law reforms for adoption in the
 these issues were divided into three tiers based on
their relative impact on the chemical  home 
 may have different priorities based on factors unique to
these  the first tier included five issues relative to
reforms which cma recommended es the basic elements in any
meaningful 
  damages should be capped
 damages should be reduced by the amount of collateral source
payments
 joint and several liability should be eliminated
 awards of punitive damages should he carefully scrutinized and
controlled by the court
 fault should be required for liability
cma 
the second tier of priority issues 
limit contingency fees
require qualified expert testimony
eliminate liability without causation
provide that initial warnings are adequate
the third tier of priority issues 
 eliminate  collateral estoppel
 bar evidence of subsequent remedial measures
 eliminate liability for conduct in compliance with government
standards
 eliminate recovery for commercial loss

time could create a wedge dividing proponents of tort 
 a model bill created by the chemical industry is
unlikely to receive the broad support available through the alec

o cma should encourage member  through state chemical
councils and other state business  to actively
participate in efforts to support general tort reform on a state

to go 
daniel  writing for the  studies 
underscored the rising importance of state  he 
 are no longer regarded as horse and buggy  as they
were in the  and are coming once again to be viewed as
laboratories of innovation and 
the conservation foundation has pointed out that
environmentalists of a decade ago generally sought federal solutions
to pollution  they now look frequently to the 
recognizing that washington has no monopoly on  
examples are  california regulations on hazardous
wastes were copied in last  rcra  california
laws passed by sher and katz in  and  were models for the
present federal regulations of  ponds and  very
 the league of women voters initiated a program on 
hazardous  focused at the local  the effort quickly
spawned twenty bills this year at the state  and promises to
attract the attention of   if not  even  new

debate on   and catastrophe

four years  as cma responded to the increasing importance of
state  they recognized the 
 the political playing field is geographically spread over 

 there are thousands of key players   hundred
legislators  with staffers and executive agency personnel
numbering thousands 
 there are  bills introduced each year which could affect
our 
 timing for political action at the state level is measured in
 not months or  as is frequently the case in

to meet these challenges cma developed a unique program that is
built on sound managerial and political 
set priorities on issues to make the most of limited

get involved as early as possible in the political process to
maximize 
develop position statements and supporting arguments before
the issue  to keep up with the fast track political
emphasize local involvement for early alert and political
 those on the scene have the best chance of
knowing  developing and politicians listen best to
those who elect 
to implement this  a network of state chemical industry
councils and trade associations was chosen to be the cornerstone of
 field marketing force to sell our positions on priority 
but it was clear that the network needed lots of support and

as jim murray reported last  activities were planned to
cultivate that network by making cma a focal point of information

gathered from the collective national resources of our  many
 these activities are well  and have truly turned cma
into a  of  for state  member company
personnel and state trade associations are routinely turning to cma

state governments and even the national association of towns and
townships are turning to cma for input on policy  agenda

our system was severely tested this year and it 
lock at some specific 

by june of last  community  was targeted for
priority coverage for the then upcoming  legislative 
drawing on two years of experience with this issue at both the state
and federal  cma staff efficiently pulled together a wealth of
 position papers with   copies of all
previous state laws and  and copies of testimony that had
been given before congress and at the state  in  cma

to educate members of the

as a whole was well prepared for the unprecedented flood of state
hills that were promptly dumped into the legislative  when the
dust settled this year over  bills on this subject had been
introduced in   and over  states passed some 
 state legislators had developed new proposals to force
governmental control on our  and tried to move the issue far
beyond the cma 
although battles are still being fought in  new jersey
and  to date all the laws passed this year are generally
consistent with cma  we have retained our trade secret
protection rights and successfully avoided costly requirements for
unique  environmental emission monitoring and independent
risk management 
public compensation was another priority issue where the results
were  it was an active issue in five states

was that no administrative public compensation program was needed and
cma 
tort law should not be  the cma policy  marching

strategy in these  the uarep study results were effectively

of the five states and marginally successful in the

established an administrative fund  and it was very limited in

problems created by an earlier  minnesota superfund

also were  we successfully prevented both the adoption of
unacceptable liability language and the inclusion of provisions for

during the past several  there has been increasing interest in the
 programs and collective capabilities of the various organizations
representing the chemical industry at the state  these organizations
include state chemical  state chemical industry councils 
and chemical industry committees of state manufacturers  in
 there has also been interest expressed concerning how the evolving
state and local involvement of cma fits with the existing  
ities and capabilities of the state 
formation oe work group
to meet this  an ad hoc work group was  composed of
member company state and public affairs professionals who both individually

 summaries of the state surveys are contained in the full report and
are presented in chart form following this executive 
conclusion from survey
organizational  the  state organizations may
be classified into four organizational 
needs for  in states of primary  the chemical
industry needs to have a network of strong cics  independent
or affiliated with other state business  with multiple
capabilities to achieve not only the primary goal in each state
which is minimizing inappropriate  but also the
national goals of the chemical industry as well which

initiatives which require local implementation or support
programs and   the  state groups
represent a broad spectrum of programs and  while a
few can be deemed fully functional organizations with multifaceted
 many are still seeking their identity or are otherwise in
a state of transition or  it is also important to point out
that many still see their role restricted almost entirely to direct

states   new jersey and  the rest of
the state organizations generally operate on budgets of well under

under current  the nature of the organizational
relationship between cma and the individual state chemical
organizations should remain as it  rather than move toward
the api approach of integrated state petroleum councils funded
and staffed directly by the national 
cma priorities should be on strengthening existing cics rather
than creating new ones at this  cma should carefully
consider how the industry should be collectively represented
in those states without cics and where there is a distinct
chemical industry issue which will not be adequately addressed
  should resources be made available
to have a cma state lobbyist on a retained basis where
circumstances 
cma should allocate funds to help finance specific projects or
operations of state chemical councils on a seed 
grant program to assist in getting new or expanded operations
 such grants for projects or expanded operations should be
for a limited time and made under specific criteria and 
cma 

the focus of such cma funding should be on supporting those
programs and priorities of the chemical industry which are of
interstate and national  funding for ongoing
programs and for issues and projects primarily of intrastate
interest should continue to be funded directly by the member
companies of each state  similar funds currently
provided through the cma communication program to help initiate
 communication projects at the state level also

  tax reform proposal
report on cma positions and actions

on may  president reagan announced his  tax reform

in  the  program would shift almost 
billion of the federal income tax burden now borne by individuals to
business  within the business  the 
program would substantially increase the tax burden of businesses that
are capital intensive and that engage in significant international
 although the impact of specific provisions may vary from
company to  the overall impact of the  tax program
would cost the chemical industry more than  billion 
the  program provides for a reduction in the maximtan
corporate tax rate from  to   in  it provides
for a deduction in computing corporate income taxes of  percent of
dividends  offsetting these  the  plan
would repeal the investment tax  replace the acrs depreciation
system with a less favorable capital cost recovery  and replace
the present minimum tax with a new minimum tax on corporate 
beginning in  significant new recapture rules would apply to
taxpayers who took depreciation deductions of  or more in the
period january   through july   under these new 
 percent of the excess depreciation claimed for tax purposes over
that allowed for earnings and profits  a  overall
 would be recaptured at  corporate tax 
 capital intensive taxpayers who used the incentives for capital
formation in president   tax program would be subject to
significant tax increases over the next three calendar 
the  tax program also proposes significant changes in
the taxation of international activities of   the
program would impose a more restrictive per country limitation on the
use of the foreign tax credit and would eliminate the old and
established   test for detesnining the source of income
from the sale of  including the export of manufactured
 the proposal includes stringent new rules on the allocation
of interest expenses among within the members of a consolidated 
significant reductions in tax benefits are also provided for
activities in   notably puerto 
in  democratic and republican congressional leaders have
supported the broad objective to pass tax reform legislation this
 the administration and congressional leaders have also

ferc order   on interstate natural gas 
on
october   the federal energy regulatory commission  issued a
rule on interstate natural gas transportation that adopted many cma

the rule authorizes  nondiscriminatory
interstate transportation 
both firm and interruptible services
must be offered by participating interstate 
 reservation
fees for firm services are 
the ferc subsequently modified the rule so that pipelines must permit
distribution company customers to reduce their existing sales demand by up
to  per year over five 
the modified rule  order  also
permitted certain transportation programs to continue until february 
thus  most pipelines have been unwilling to transport gas under
the new 
the justice department is investigating complaints that
pipelines have colluded in refusing to carry gas under those 
ferc proposed rules on natural gas 
cma and other industrial
consumers urged the ferc not to implement a proposed block billing
mechanism for interstate pipeline 
on december   cma
testified before the ferc and presented results of an economic impact
study on the proposed block billing 
cma said the cost of the rule
to american industry would be  billion per  and the annual cost
to the chemical industry alone would be approximately  
both the chemical industry and industry in  rely
substantially on gas purchased directly from 
for  the
chemical industry purchases  of its natural gas from sources other than
conventional pipeline system 
the  done for cma by foster
 predicts the proposed pricing rule would raise the price of
gas being purchased directly from 
 industrial users
buying interstate gas could be allocated higher gas 
the ferc proposal also restricts pipeline sales of  gas to
existing 
this will increase pressure on both local
distribution companies  and  to purchase gas directly from
 leading to a shift away from conventional pipeline system

the proposed rule nullifies the potential advantages of increased
competition through the expedited certificate 
it reduces
  and encourages bypass of traditional
pipeline system supply 
the study also indicates the ferc proposal would increase spot 
direct  and traditional pipeline 
it would add
pressure on ldcs and  to buy directly from producers since
pipeline competition will be restricted to  
this will
increase the demand for spot or

cma 
in  cma noted that since  gas is in
competition with   the marginal cost of  gas
will be 
the ceiling on  prices will be raised by
as much as  cents per million 
proposed rules on old gas 
the ferc block billing proposal
fails to deal with the basic problem of continuing price controls that
prevent maximum efficient development and use of the lowest cost  
resource  and cma continues to advocate legislation to deregulate
wellhead ceiling  and to remove market 
it appears that
some cma goals may be achieved through regulatory reform proposals offered
recently by the department of energy with the support of the justice

on november  doe proposed a rule for final action by the
ferc that makes all old gas eligible for a higher  and reasonable
 and that would establish incentive prices for old 
on december  the ferc issues a schedule for the notice of proposed
rulemaking  rm
