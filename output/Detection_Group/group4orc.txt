trade commlttee   the second year of  fomal  
obvlous to all of us that  recent years chemlcal  sales and
earnlngs have depended upon large volumes of  three measurements
  are on an unfortunate 
in  the dollar value of  chemlcal exports was  
  the value sllpped to 
for two consecutlve  the trade surplus  chemlcals the excess
of exports over unports has  the   and  dollar
values      bllllon and  
over the same twoiyear  the share of  sales golng m the
export trade has decllned from  percent to  
the two sides of our current trade reallty are  chemlcal exports
are decreaslng whlle at the same time  are on the 
 another trade reallty that the  chemlcal  has to
reckon mm as  and that  the swlng toward protectlonlsm we are
seemg all around the globe   the    
confldent of  ability to compete  world trade m the extent that
we are not blocked from dolng so by governmental  whether the
government be our own or that of a forelgn  mule the words
of the internatlonal trade  charter may say  more 
 a shortitext verslon of our mlsslon  to work to remove exlstlng
barrlers and m derall attempts to create new

see as the  major accompllshments durlng the year and the
major lssues before us  
flrst a word on

brlnglng our task group number to  we broadened the mlsslon of the
north amerlcan trade pollcy task group to  all unport matters
affectlng cm member  the task  name was changed to
import pollcy task  we expanded the membershlp of our multlnatlonal
cozporatlons task group and changed  name to the intergovernmental
drganlzatlons task group to better reflect  proper  early 
cma 
the year we formed an investment pollcy task group to more adequately
cover thls pollcy area and m provlde support  dexter baker who  now

the assoclatlon supported the jolnt natlonal forelgn trade 
councll posltlon on the lssue and the heavlly amended verslon that was
approved by the european parllament was clearly a defeat for  hackers
and was vlewed as resultlng from effectlve lobbylng by  
a major reason behlnd the formatlon of thls task group was the varlety
of actlvltles concernlng  companles golng on  varlous
agencles of the unlted  durlng  these actlvltles were priory
tlzed from the  chemlcal   and a number of meetlngs

concerned mm raising 
whlle we can support the
cma  i am convlnced that we must address a more

serlous longitem 
the chemlcal  faces a major  a problem so
severe  shakes cma and many of the 
obvlous confllcts of vlew that are 
there are
they are serlous
because each tax proposal can have a major adverse unpact on


some of the companles hlthln the 
our argument can be that thls  supports  at the seam mllllon level hlth a llmlted annual
borrowlng 
 thls  does not have
the r venue capaclty to fund the major socletal cost of a
new welfare 

j
i
no  especlally our  should
be allowed to lose slght of the fact that a complete cleanup
of all hazardous waste sltes  the unlted states  another
w lfare 
and that becomes partlcularly true  the
vlctlm compensatlon leglslatlon  marrled to thls 
t
we must make the cogent economc arguments and make them
 terms that are both bellevable and 
even at a
 bllllon annual fundlng  the chemlcal  does
not 
 the real effect when the tax becomes
centered on a very narrow revenue  of give or take seven
chemlcals and give or take    that an eroslon
beglns that moves productlon of the partlcular chemlcals 

eroslon may be more pernlclous than 
that
cma 
eroslon will soon  because for most of the affected
chemlcals there  worldwlde excess 
from the 
ofivlew of the chemlcal  the fact that the productlon
may move from unlted states sources to forelgn sources may be
good news or bad news dependlng upon the  
worldwlde capaclty sltuatlon and worldwlde market 
from a unlted states government  any movement of
productlon out of the unlted states defeats the revenue

 tax commlts sulclde by kllllng 
  eroslve effect dlmlnlshes the
general  tax base as 
the staffs of the commlttees
responslble for raising revenues can be made to understand
thls 
 we must artlculate  carefully and
wlthout  because overstatement will be followed
by complete dlsbellef and we cannot afford that 
we can make a  posltlve argument for a 
tax based on  equlty and 
equlty  that 
compels people to do what they ought to  that  
dlspose of thelr waste  an envlronmentally safe 
falrness  that all those who dlspose of waste pay a

a real danger that such a change  the tort law will be carrled over to

the task group agreed that a mlddle ground was  our goal
was to develop a posltlve program chat would deal hlth publlc
perceptlons of the hazardous waste exposure 
we recommend that am support a revlslon of sectlon  and
 of cercla to provlde for more slte speclflc health studles and
medlcal monltorlng at old hazardous waste  our proposed changes
to the statute would give the centers for dlsease control  new
authorlty to  health concerns around waste sltes 
situations chat posed less than a publlc health emergency  publlc
emergencles can now be  cue would be able to conduct
health status surveys and screenlng programs of people exposed to
hazardous 
our approach treats the  perceptlon that old waste slces are
causlng dlsease and lllness as a publlc health problem rather than a
problem of how to dellver compensatlon under the  or any
proposed legal 
the objectlves of our proposed changes to sectlon   provlde
greater flexlblllty than now exlsts to utilize that sectlon for medlcal
  the survelllance to  demonstratlng actual

for such   was the cask  consensus that we would
be better advlsed not to put too much detall in the  and instead
work mm the appllcable agency on the proper protocol or scheme used to
carry out the statutory 
 thls approach allows us to bulld on the man 
under any of the posslble results of that  the approach suggested
here could be

if we  speak for the chemlcal 
who 
most of our effort focuses on developmg natlonal codes
and standards whlch are acceptable to the chemlcal 
beyond that we sponsor forums on subjects of common 
for example computerlzed process control  recently
we added  support of educatlon to our

electrlcal codes and standards
in past  you have heard about the work of our
electrlcal codes  standards task group to protect our 
 by keeplng the natlonal electrlcal code  we

defended favorable amendments and reslsted those whlch are

as far back as  the code has requlred on electrlc

i am pleased to have thls opportunlty to present the annual grc 
x would llke to call your attentlon m the wrltten  prevlously 
trlbuted to  partlcularly sectlon     commlttee dbjectlves
and  sectlon   report on the substantlve  and
sectlon  major leglslatlve issues tlmetables and priorities as i will
not cover these matters  my 
last year we reported on the unpllcatlons of the polltlcal changes
brought about by the electlon of presldent reagan and a republlcan senate
and how these changes mlght  on the chemlcal  effect the role
of the sec and our leglslatlve  we mentloned that the economlc
  budget  and soclal securlty reform would domlnate the
time and attentlon of both the admlnlstratlon and congress and that we dld
not expect major envlronmental or health leglslatlon to pass   in
 we stated that these lssues would be put off untll  brlnglng
them  conslderatlon durlng an electlon  thus maklng  even more
dlfflcult to achleve substantlal  we also stated that thls dld
not mean that efforts should not be made to amend key  but we
had to be reallstlc about our chances for  we polnted out that
significant leglslatlon mlght be set esme and no flnal actlon taken untll

 now appears to be the 
we are greatly dlsappolnted that the seemlngly favorable polltlcal
makeup of the admlnlstratlon and congress dld not produce  but
what has happened was not totally 
 we are contlnulng to work for comprehenslve changes  
number of  and the organlzatlonal objectlves we achleved last year
place us   much stronger posltlon to advocate change than  the 
by a more systematlc focus on strategy and   communlcatlons
and coordlnatlon within the cma structure and contlnulng efforts to educate
members of congress and admlnlstratlon offlclals mm wellireasoned posltlons
and good backup  posltlons on the lssues have been changlng for the

  agalnst thls background that the sec crlthued  actlvltles and
developed our objectlves for the comlng  the major questlon we asked
ourselves was how can we do better and what are the thlngs we have to do to
be 
cm 
we examlned the varlous factors that unpact upon the leglslatlve

the  publlc understandlng of the chemlcal

 the sec  washlngton representatlves
and the 
the chemlcal  and  polltlcal 
chemlcal  lssues and 
i would llke to cover just two of those 
 one of the essentlal lngredlents  settlng the scene for
achlevlng leglslatlve success   why   when our
 advocates changes  leglslatlon that the publlc percelves 
as an attempt to gut a law that protects them and the envlronment and that
our sole reason for wantlng change   why does thls mlsconceptlon
carry over to the congress whlch gives us sympathy and  but
out of fear of publlc opinion will not vote to support responslble changes
that are well justlfled on the merlts and by good  the maln
reason  the smgle message perslstently carrled by the  
by envlronmental  that mdusmyadvocated changes gut the  and
that  wants change only to save    easytoistate  substantlated by a few lsolated examples from the 
but presented as a  has created a total mlsconceptlon of
the chemlcal 
to accompllsh our  leglslatlve  the sec feels  
essentlal that we take the necessary actlons to clear up these mlsconi
ceptlons by better coordlnatlon of our communlcatlons program mm our
leglslatlve 
we will  those lssues of  prioritize  set
goals and    developmg communlcatlons that are 
tlve  the leglslatlve  and create a new sense of dlrectlon and

the sec will take actlon jolntly hlth the conmunlcatlons commlttee
to deal hlth the  we have voted to form a task group on leglsi
 to oversee these  and through thls 
target  
the second essentlal lngredlent  what he referred to  our report
as  the chemlcal  has conslderable polltlcal clout us you
want to call   but we are not sure that thls clout  bemg used
 the most effectlve    a sensltlve area and one we are 
cm 
cant m dlscuss because  could be mlslntezpreted as  mm
  not the  we are all  the same

  we are all affected by the passage of leglslatlon
that calls for further regulatlon of our  we elther smk or
swlm  what he will be trylng to do  prudently threat and
utilize thls clout m accompllsh four leglslatlve

we plan a number of actlons to gather  on just where
the  stands and the detalls of these actlvltles are spelled out
 sectlon viii of our  we will need your personal commltment and
support  thls 
another sensltlve area i would llke m mentlon  cm  
thls  there are tunes where certaln hlghilevel contacts must be
made within the admlnlstratlon or mm the congresslonal 
some cases thls already has been    our opinion that we can
only achleve credlblllty at that level by representatlon from the 
the hlred guns can go only so  the system calls for brlnglng 
the mg guns on speclflc lssues where an approprlate relatlonshlp 
  will be requested through the proper cm channels and
here agaln we ask you 
we belleve the commlttee plans and objectlves for  and  of 
provlng  worklng  coalltlons and focuslng on 
energetlcally pursued will go a long way toward enhanclng our chances of
achlevlng our leglslatlve 
a look at the mem
t
as far as the executlve branch   we are belng llstened
m and we have not been faced mm a flow of new  deregulatlon
has not produced the changes we had hoped for but there has been 
 takes  the reform movement has lost some momentum as efa 
m a lesser  osha have baen under polltlcal    apparent
 leglslatlon bemg consldered by congress  that a number of amendments
to varlous laws are deslgned to force epa  taklng actlon or handcufflng
them where they have used thelr dlscretlon on lssues the envlronmentallsts
hold 
actlon by the admlnlstratlon  lobbylng for changes  envlronmental
leglslatlon   the whlte house  keenly aware that publlc
opinion holds llttle sympathy for amendments to  health and
safety laws and  keeplng a low proflle on the 
the  llne  that we cannot expect too much executlve branch
support on envlronmental leglslatlon at thls   we should be
alert to the signals that the whlte house  concerned about  lmage on
cm 
envlronmental  and  order to neutrallze thls lssue we can expect
some admlnlstratlve actlon  to show thelr concern for those

as far as congress   the votes  the house on  and
clean alr  the house and senate causes great  many months of
work mm the congresslonal commlttees  hammerlng out compromlses have
easlly gone down to defeat on the floor of congress because of the emotlonal
and polltlcal cllmate that exlsts 
what we are seemg today  a number of battles   war where the
outcome    
at thls stage we do not expect any major envlronmental leglslatlon to
pass thls sesslon of 
 at forecast on speclflc lssues 
sectlon   forecast could change as the politics of the lssues are
so complex   difficult to give a preclse   there will
be llttle time to deal hlth these lssues between the tune congress returns
september a and adjourns the  week   we are contlnulng to
work for comprehenslve and constructlve changes  the laws belng consldered
and thls pressure  havlng the effect of extendlng the 
what about    we belleve most of these lssues will be
addressed   what will be the polltlcal situation at that  the
outcome of the  electlons hill determlne the character of the next
 there are as many oplnlons on what the character mlght be as there
are people who make  we  quallfled m predlct but some
experts do not feel the change will be all that  republlcans are
predlcted to malntaln control of the senate and will not loose a significant
number of seats  the 
a key factor     impacting on leglslatlon will be the shape
of the economy and the jobs  since   a presldentlal electlon 
what takes place   hill detemlne the lssues of the   and
what congress and the admlnlstratlon belleves to be publlc opinion will blas
conslderatlon of  health and safety    one
of the reasons we belleve our communlcatlons efforts are 
we cannot be sure of the answers to those questlons at thls  we
can only be sure that under any set of polltlcal clrcumstances our goals will
not be easy to  we are confldent that the approach we have developed
to deal hlth these lssues will serve us well under any clrcumstances and 
the long haul lead to 
we will not be dlsappolnted  leglslatlon  not passed durlng thls
congress because  most cases what  belng consldered  worse 
or llttle better  what now  to say that the situation will
only get worse next year could be  as meanlng we do not have

good  my energy commlttee report  a  llke a good  bad news
 the good news has already happened  the year just  the bad
news  waiting to happen   and  may  we relax our efforts durlng
the current 
last year i optlmlstlcally tltled ay report   antlclpatlng that
we had reached a major turnlng polnt  federal energy  that we could
correct the excesses of the past and  partlcular the overregulatlon of the
carter years and the elva part natlonal energy act of  that we could
move from supply regulatlon and demand restrlctlon to supply stlmulatlon
through free market  knowlng that further galns  energy conservatlon
and fuel swltchlng and most importantly market stablllty and predlctablllty
would  that optimism was based on the electlon of ronald raagan mm
his free market energy    useful to revlew two parts of the
energy plank of the  bepubllcan 
 order m  domestlc productlon of  
 advocate the decontrol of the price at the wellhead of  and
 also belleve that market restrlctlons on the use of
natural gas should be 
  understand that a free market based on the
collectlve priorities and judgments of  consumers will
efflclently allocate the energy supplies to thelr most mghly valued

the presldent has dellvered on many of his energy  the energy
commlttee llkes to trunk that we have helped over the past 
last year we identified two major ltems for our energy 
natural gas  and
elimination of  federal allocatlon schemes for the
dlstrlbutlon of crude  under the emergency preparedness allocatlon 
for emergency  we prepared recommendatlons and testlfled before
congress and lobbled for no mu to replace the explred  whlle these
efforts  convlnce congress that a mm was not  we belleve
they dld help to relnforce presldent  resolve that no mm was
 although congress passed the standby petroleum allocatlon  the
presldent vetoed that mm and  a remarkable turnaround the senate sustalned
the veto after passlng the spaa by a vote of as m 
i also reported significant reductlons  the regulatory burden of the power
plant and industrlal fuel use act and thls year i can agaln report even
further  these regulatlons were one of those identified for vice
presldent  regulatory reform task 
 

in march presldent reagan ended any chance of congresslonal actlon on the
deregulatlon of natural gas when he announced that he would not seek
leglslatlon   mule consumer actlvlsts and other opponents of
deregulatlon ballad the  announcement as a major victory most
 recognlzed  as a postponement not a solutlon m the problems of
the natural gas pollcy act and the publlc debate has 
the energy commlttee recognlzed that the  partlcularly as reported by
the  was not golng   the exaggerated clalms of the
consumer actlvlsts and other opponents of decontrol were conslstently galnlng
headllnes whlle more ratlonal analyses were belng  the energy
commlttee commlssloned foster  a natlonally recognlzed natural gas
authorlty and  to compare and analyze ten recent studles of natural
gas deregulatlon that varled wldely  thelr findings on the unpact of
 as you would  the concluslons of each study supported the
vlews of the 
foster found two studles decldedly more comprehenslve and reallstlc
assessments of total phased  these were by the department of energy
and standard  of 
 foster found three studles predlcted  and
unsupportable eleld price  and hence contrlbuted llttle m a
constructlve analysls of the decontrol  in march we held a press
conference to release the foster study and we followed that mm a
congresslonal staff  both events were well  just last
month representatlve dannemeyer from callfornla quoted from our study  the
current hearlngs before the house fossll and synthetlc fuels 
in  our energy conservatlon resumed  upward progress by clunblng to
  better than    partlcularly encouraglng  llght of
the stagnant  our voluntary goal of  appears well hlthln 
  also of  to examlne how our raw energy consumptlon has changed
since   table reflects raw energy usage as reported by our member
  has not been corrected for productlon  significant
reductlons have been made  fuel  and natural gas 
surprlslngly coal use  actually down sllghtly and electrlclty  up

  our last chance for leglslatlon to be enacted to replace the ngpa

free market access for all   and dlstrlbutors to all
types of natural gas 
a coordlnated removal of supply and demand restralnts includmg the
repeal of the  sectlons of the fuel use act and 

in order to make significant progress over the comlng months  the
deregulatlon  he must address  detall four areas of

reluctant to give up natural gas access and blddlng advantages that they have
under the  many are hllllng m decontrol old  but not slmultaneously
hlth new 
 the problem of   the 
pipelines are qulte concerned about imprudent contracts that they have 
partlcularly after the ngpa was  that contaln price escalator
 in theory these  upon  would increase the price of
