the prlmary  wastes management commlttee  concern
 for leglslatlve proposals for scicalled  waste

for the last several years the stc reports have
 leglslatlve actlvlty durlng the prevlous year and the
expectatlon of restrlctlve leglslatlon the followlng  
though i am pleased to say that these forebodlngs have not come
to  i qulckly note that the current sltuatlon  qulte
slmllar to that of past years leglslatlon may well be passed
durlng thls  
the flrst significant act deallng
hlth solld waste was passed   and the second leglslatlve
actlon followed  
durlng  there was leglslatlve
actlvlty  thls area  assumlng elva years to be a reasonable
gestatlon   could be the 
 leglslatlon will
not be as far reachlng as that bemg proposed for toxlc 
but  hill slgnlflcantly  chemlcal process  

since the last stc report to the  there have been
nine major leglslatlve  elther actual  or worklng
 concernlng solld 
of these the senate publlc works
commlttee    sponsored by senator jennlngs randolph
and the house interstate and forelgn commerce  
commlttee on transportatlon and commerce worklng draft as sponsored
by congressman  are the two most llkely candldates for

the admlnlstratlon has not sponsored a mm but has
 general support of   we expect that each
proposal will reach  respectlve floor  
although mm some undeslrable  senator 
mm  certalnly the more acceptable of the two 
both
documents contaln    but    much
less compllcated and  does not requlre federal approval for all
permlts for waste  treatment and  but rather
concentrates on state  of a permlt system similar
to current alr and water 
the rooney proposal
requlres pemlts at both

cm 




areas not     such as product and contalner control
as a means of source waste reductlon and tax  for  we belleve that the rooney worklng draft will be modlfled
to resemble the senate publlc works 
whatever the flnal form of the  mca hill strongly
espouse the concept of perfomance requlrements for waste dlsposal
rather than the predetermlnatlon or specification approach currently
belng  waste should be deemed hazardous only after 
 quantlty and dlsposal slte have been carefully 
predetemlnatlon of a waste dlsposal method wlthout investigating
each of these parameters  counterproductlve because thls restrlcts
development of new technology and precludes the use of vlable
alternatlves approprlate to speclflc geographlcal areas or to
avaliable  mca hill contend that the authorlty over
the areas of  transportatlon and storage of waste
materlals contlnue to be vested  the  department of 

should adoptlon of a permlt system be 
he will advocate that the dlsposal slte rather than the generator
be the pemlttee and that state luvplementatlon of the permit
system under federal guldellnes  preferred over threat federal

requlrements from both a technlcal and economlc  he
will strlve for sufflclent time constralnts and flexlblllty 
any leglslatlon to accommodate the dearth of technology and dlsposal cost data currently avaliable to 
many of the  most notably texas and  have
 passed solld waste management leglslatlon deallng mm hazardous

because thls leglslatlon has preceded federal hazardous
waste dlsposal    qulte llkely that the epa may
adopt those concepts fostered by these states whlch have proven

therefore that when the conmlctee takes up capltal formatlon

more favorable to  than chat of the

slnce the vice chalman of our  frederlck barbour
of rohm and  reported to you  september of  we have
been concerned prlmarlly mm the leglslatlve actlvlty whlch led

our testlmony before both commlttees was devoted to two
prlnclpal areas   capltal formatlon and taxatlon of
forelgn source 
 the capltal formatlon area we recommended the adoptlon
of such tax  as maklng the ma  tax credlt
 reduclng the corporate  tax  and provldlng
addltlonal cost recovery  we contended these actlons
are needed to   to generate sufflclent funds
 to meet capltal

in the forelgn source   the new tax law has a
numb r of dlsturblng  but  dld not deal to any baslc
extent hlth the two ltems of major concern to  namely the
timing of taxatlon of forelgn source

you will recall that a group of tax

a major premlse of thls report  that busmess 
not as   washlngton as we would llke  m
be nor as  as we must be  any vlable form
of prlvate enterprlse  to be preserved  thls 
 was not too many years ago that busmessmen were
llstened m hlth conslderable attentlon by those members
of congress who wore elther a republlcan or southern demoi
crat 
but that  no longer the  what 
when i flrst came to washlngton   one of the
power houses on the  was judge  of  am
id school southern democrat and head of the then allpowerful house rules 
if he declded he

 to go to the house 
 the pressure got too
gr  he just went down to his  to as he used to
 not saylng thls was the rlght way to run the

but  was a tune when busmessmen had more
  congress than we have 
but that day
went out mm the  onsivote drlve that took place
more than a decade  and for a varlety of other 
for  the polltlclzlng of labor unlons was
another contrlbutlng

moved  the polltlcal ring   mg  convlnced
that  could wln  state leglslatures and the congress
what  could not wln at the bargalnlng 
labor
money and labor manpower are now major factors  
slonal electlon 
and  lobbylng muscle
on capltol   the envy of those of us on the busmess

i
televlslon  another factor that has changed the
process of selectlng and  members of

cm 
to candldates tends to open up the selectlon 
another and more recent development has been the rlse
of publlc  
they are dedlcated and 

a member of congress must be responslve to
thelr pressures or else   hlmself faclng more
competltlon for his seat  the next prlmary and general

buslness has not been totally unresponslve to these
changlng  mm the rlse of mg government and
mg labor after  some large companles opened 
lngton offlces to assure that thelr vlews were bemg
conveyed to congress and the 
at the
same tune that the washlngton corporate offlce was bemg
 by a relatlve handful of   must 
there was a parallel development of the trade assoclatlon
as an  for communlcatlng hlth 
in
the last two  trade assoclatlons have become as
much a washlngton growth phenomenon as government 
and  within the last few years we have even
seen the cm comlng m washlngton to engage  threat
lobbylng where an lssue was of such paramount unportance
to the cozporatlon that  merlted his personal 
 technlque became so    that the
buslness roundtable was conned expressly to assure organlzed
cm   the lobbylng 
but the washlngton corporate offlce and the trade
assoclatlon and the cm as lobbylsts are not totally
responslve to  
what busmess lacks  a grassroots 
many
members of congress are candld  saylng thls to your
washlngton corporate 
nght or 
members of congress are telllng us that oplnlons from
the corporate board room no longer carry the welght they
once 
in the vernacular of capltol  they ask
 many votes have you 
 too many  busmess fall to 
stand that m a polltlclan the vote tally on electlon day
 the endiall and   the same manner as  to
you the bottom llne on your corporate flnanclal 
i
am 

how do we get a grassroots volce on capltol 
we start by developmg two resources that presently are
largely untapped by busmess employees and 
 we give our employees an understandlng of
how our busmesses  an understandlng of the klnd of
governmental cllmate that must exlst for preservatlon of
prlvate  and an understandlng of how thelr
personal welfare relates to that of the 
lest anyone assume that thls  not a bonaflde 
i quote from the january lssue of the conference board
 whlch  of the amerlcan  they
mlsunderstand the relatlonshlps between prices and costs
and between real  productlvlty and capltal 
 they overestlmate the level of corporate proflt
 and they belleve that    not 
who pays the corporate  
if we help our employees understand these 
then they will see that thelr congresslonal representatlves
understand 
the stockholder  not so much  need of economc
ducatlon as he  of belng  about how prospectlve
government actlons will affect the return on his 
once he has that  communlcatlon hlth congress
will take care of 
let me lllustrate what  saylng mm a true 
  burt   sevenitem member of the house
of representatlves from callfornla untll ms defeat last

 talcott voted  llne mm the busmess
communlty posltlon on lssues about an percent of the 
 labor gave mm only a  percent favorable
vote 
in october  a delegatlon of callfornla busmessmen
met hlth the callfornla congresslonal delegatlon to express
 vlews on then pendlng 
 
talcott wrote to these 
let me quote from that

 representatlves of the  w cannot  
practlcal or polltlcal sensey support an  or

 wlthout support of people  the people
we dlrectly 
we need support as you
need a

there  no easy
way to leapfrog them to persuade a group of

pack the polltlcal 
they can be 
but  as a  cannot do  w at least
wlthout vour 
perhaps one of your unlon leaders should have
appeared mm 
one unlon leader would have
unpressed more than half of our 
  advlce to the callfornla busmessmen
was echoed by  barber conable of new  one of the
brlghtest and most capable members of the  when he
spoke not long ago to a group of pflzer management 
he counselled pflzer to talk to  own people so that they
would understand why  conable takes the posltlons he

wlthout such   conable  
  reference to a unlon leader  mean
that unlon leaders are more persuaslve than 
 simply means that from a   unlon
spokesmen presently represent more votes than we 
that perceptlon  certalnly true   

 no longer   thanks to labor unlon
and envlronmentallst polltlcal 
bryce  counsellor to presldents and procter 
 washlngton  has an 
concept of thls matter of

a polltlclan looks at you as a company  or me
as a washlngton  or at  he looks through
us as though we were a 
he wants to see what 
behlnd us to detemlne  we can hurt mm or help 
too  the polltlclan sees nothlng behlnd us 
when he  he knows he can  our 
cm 

 much then for the need for grassroots support
 our posltlons are to prevall  
 
not my  nor have we tune for the mechanlcs of
how thls will be 
except that  will not be done by sllck pr 
nlques nor by writing a check once a year to some organlzai
tlon that promlses you  can  the amerlcan publlc
about free 
now let me shlft focus to another  but whlch
 related to all that   so  llke one slde
of a com  related to the 
buslness cannot be  elther to  own
employees or to    lacks 
and busmess has a credlblllty problem stemmlng from
such thlngs as price   and envlronmental

i do not belleve  except for a few amoral
  corporate leaders consclously
condone breaklng the 
 these thlngs happen
because not enough attentlon  paid to establlshlng
controls that will prevent 
and so i make thls 
that every company
have a system of   whlch has the express
purpose of  for management potentlal problem
areas hlthln the 
  my bellef that
somewhere  any company there are always 
who know when the fine llne of lllegallty  bemg 
or some practlce  bemg followed that  questlonable
from an  safety or health 
there must
be a way for these people to report thelr concerns so
that management can take correctlve steps before lay
trlevable damage  done  both to the company and to
the busmess 
 not advocatlng 
 cm announced
recently that  has set up a system that gives  duly
slonal flnance offlcers an opportunlty to report problem
another mca    has recently lusty
tuted an audltlng procedure  the health and safety 
 thls  a practlcal 
cm 
in  i have suggested to you that we should
do two thlngs to help preserve prlvate  
enllst the partlclpatlon of our employees and stockholders
  establlsh an  method for identifying

from october 
 the commlttee has  where legally  a

an overirldlng reason for the
relatlve modesty of these flgures was  due to the

pared mm   
there are very few major mca member companles not taklng part
  energy reportlng program or those of other relevant assocy

these few companles have been 
 and will hopefully be taklng part  the next report to

the top energyiconsumlng companles  each of the ten alreadyildeni

number  
some an companles reportlng through mca have
llsted energy purchases of over a trllllon  a  and there
may be other such companles reportlng through the fertlllzer
 
 therefore seems llkely that the cutioff polnt
