remarks to cma board of directors
 occupational safety and health committee
january  
during the years  and  and  under the leadership of tom
 the osh committee of cma was   and became
recognized by government agencies as a force for industry representation
and cooperative  with this as a foundation we decided to look at the
tasks for the year  he decided   we should 
the current osha   establish  nonduplicative efforts with other   establish strong 
tions with other cma committees whose work overlapped and influenced  and
consolidate  eliminate task groups where 
the attitude of the current osha administration was succinctly made clear
to us by a communication which we received from mark  the 
assistant secretary for  he   years of stating that industry
if given the opportunity is well equipped to address workplace  industry
 in the osha area has an opportunity which may never again be  the
opportunity exists for corporate america to double and  their efforts
in this field so as to prove it can be done without undue government 
the chance to demonstrate conclusively that companies sincerely care about their
workforce is  should this opportunity be  or  should
corporations through a  of safety and health programs give credence
to the allegation that the only concern in the boardroom is  the old osha
of days past will rise from the grave with a  now is not the time for
corporations to let down their guard nor to relax measures which have resulted in
gains in the safety and health 
he believe that this gives us a clear indication that the current osha
administration will continue in the vein that they have been and that they are
open for cooperative efforts from industry 
he are redoubling our efforts to establish closer and more efficient 
tion with a number of industry  since numbers of our health and safety
people serve on task forces with diverse   attempting to determine
who should have the lead role in responding to individual osha regulations in an
effort to minimize the  travel and effort required of the members of your
company on these various  the organization deemed most appropriate to
prepare the primary response does  the other organizations then adapt the response
to their 
he are in the process of eliminating some task groups and consolidating others
and will reduce the number of task groups from  to  or  in an effort to 
line the work of the osh  and again reduce the time and travel required
by task group   major efforts will continue in the area of
 reproductive   targeting health 
industrial  performance  and hazards  federal and
and state and 
cma 

we have been involved with a number of activities with the government
agencies involved with health and safety  a major theme which runs
throughout our responses and testimony related to all osha standards and
regulations is the  performance  we are constantly advising
osha to write their standards with the goals and objectives  the
general processes   including work practices to reach the
 and to minimize the specifications in the materials and 
a major effort has been carried out by the safety standards group in
this  they have written a model standard for hazardous substances in the
workplace in performance  at the request of the assistant secretary
for osha they have used this document in a training session for standards writers
in an effort to educate them in the writing of performance  this has
been well received by osha and the task group has received a letter of thanks
from the director of osha for their  it is our hope that with this
training effort and interaction with  the new standards will be written
in true performance 
another significant work effort with osha has led to the adoption of the
safety inspection targeting system for routine safety  this enables
osha to focus their inspections on  industries where  do the
most  and enables those of us with good safety records to be free of routine
safety 
work is ongoing to apply a similar methodology for health  
recently two of our members attended an osha workshop where an effort was being
made to devise such a  the method recommended by the cma members appears
to have been favorably received by other members of  the  and
the governmental  we shall continue with efforts in this area over the
near 
another major effort was carried out on the standard for hazards 
 this culminated in testimony by a  panel of cma on june  
 work in this area was completed when  comments were filed in
  as stated   hopeful that a federal standard in
this area will reempt a myriad of state standards which currently exist from
being enforced and also prevent the writing of standards by states and communities
which have not yet done 
we presented the argument that osha has the authority to preempt states
standards with a federal standard on the basis that a myriad of state standards
will present an undue burden on interstate 
this brings me to the area of states activities task group which is doing
yeoman work to track and respond to an increasing number of state and local 
tives dealing with hazardous substances under worker  to  and community
 to   it is not clear whether the promulgation of a federal
hazardous communication standard will supersede the current states statutes but
the minimum we hope to achieve is to reduce the proliferation of further state
and community statutes in this  it is worthy of note that the state of
california has already announced their position that there is no federal override
so long as the state statute is  stringent  the   although
the federal statute may affect  right to  laws from proliferating
we are unsure as to what effect it will have on  right to  
considerable work remains to be done in this area in conjunction with the
legislative affairs 
cma 
the issue of  reproductive risk in the  deserves some
 the reproductive risk issue continues to be active with legislators
and in the news  as you are probably  a recent court decision in the
  the concept that prohibiting a fertile female from working in
an evnironment which is harmful to the fetus does not constitute discrimination
on the basis of  but is a legitimate work   has had a lead
position on this issue for some time and the osh committee will be conducting
a conference on  reproductive risk in the  on may  and 
 it will focus on a review of the most recent information in this field
with emphasis on how various companies are addressing  attendees will be
restricted to  members from various line and staff 
in the latter half of  conferences will be conducted on  
and on  safety 
in addressing the future the committee determined that it needed a better
mechanism for  and  from the myriad of issues which ones it
should most appropriately  in an effort to do  we determined that
we would look at the issues presented to us from the viewpoint of the likelihood
of their occurrence and their potential impact on cma member  issu s
will be submitted to the osh committee by the redesigned future issues task
 members of the  and the general membership of 
in  the osh committee recognizes that the problem of 
community and product liability which is currently being addressed by the
executive committee will be a very significant issue for federal and state
legislators for some time to  and will be intertwined with hazardous
substances  worker  to  and community  to

remarks to cma board of directors
by  hamilton hurst
 chemical regulations advisory committee
january  
it seems like only a few months  i had the pleasure of addressing this
group to outline the activities of your chemical regulation advisory committee
 in the  we have had a busy but a very productive  i am
pleased to be here once again to highlight for you what has taken place and
to outline our plans for the coming 
in your   you will find a detailed summary of our 
this has been prepared by the cma staff which has been of great assistance to
us throughout the  z will not cover all of the items included in this
summary as i want to spend my time here discussing the major events and our
future 
there are a few key events that did take place over the last  months which
deserve a quick  when we talked  the epa   
mented only a portion of what tsca will ultimately  there was much 
icism of the  failure to implement  the events of  have
changed that and a great portion of the proposed rules have been finalized
and put into 
reporting requirements of tsca
 use and exposure data were required on  chemicals
by  
health and safety studies were required on  chemicals by
 
testing
for  the court mandated a schedule for epa to respond with a
decision to test or not to test    the
efa has made those decisions in  cases with  others 
in addition to the court ordered  epa has made decisions
on  other  
chemical control
rules for regulating  in electrical equipment and excluding
cma 
some closed or controlled waste manufacturing systems were
 a third pcb regulation  now for 
 will address all other processes which generate incidental
new chemicals
some  new chemicals have gone through the pmn process with
only a handful being  the spa reports that 
mately  of the  are of such low risk that they can
complete this review in about   only  warrant extensive
review exceeding  days  less than  have resulted in
either spa orders or were withdrawn by the submitter because of
questions on risks associated with the  the agency has
responded to  petition to exempt certain  
  intermediates and polymers from full pmn
 based on results of their pmn review  epa
proposed exemption rules in   which should finalize
by  
since the events i have outlined are epa actions and regulations at  you
might reasonably ask   what has crac done to earn our pay  the epa
seems to have done all the work  and what we have gotten are 
i can proudly say  we have done a  cma has had major impact in each
of these  our  
in the reporting area
for  use and exposure data  the original epa
proposals covered  chemicals  about  times what was covered
in the final  cma was successful in convincing epa they should
ask only for the amount of data they could reasonably handle and
digest on a current  we were able to avoid data gathering
for data  
the health and safety data
in the finalization of these  we were successful in reducing
the amount of data to be  we were able to shorten the
historical time period for which each company must review their
records and submit 
testing
in the testing   use and test data information
cma 
input from the individual companies has resulted in a number of
decisions by the epa to not require testing of 
 in other  companies have been able to use
 to reach agreement with the agency on what testing
is most reasonably  crac has promoted the acceptance of
the   concept as a practical substitute for
formal   under  negotiated test agreements save
our resources and result in testing programs which focus only on
the most significant 
new chemicals
the experience epa has now achieved from processing  
has allowed us to isolate facts from this data to demonstrate and
convince the epa that exemptions to the pmn system were 
justified and would help both industry and the  while the
agency would always like to have more information and test data
submitted on the  they have developed review procedures using
pmn information and  similarity studies with which they
are satisfied they can carry out their responsibilities for pmn
review under  it was very refreshing to hear an epa spokesman
at a recent presentation of their pmn system remark   
nize that the pmn can be a terrible burden on new product 
 there is no way we should expect the development of complete
test data on each new chemical at this stage of their 
nor do we need it to make the assessments required by   here
 the epa has heard   come a long way  at least
with  the epa is getting 
while we have our  we still have some major obstacles in front of
us an important priorities for 
oversight hearings  scheduled for early 
final pmn rules  scheduled by the second 
final pmn exemption rules  scheduled by the third 
the development of  approach to assign priority to and to regulate
existing 
these forthcoming events dictate our immediate plans for the future and it will
require our close attention to solidify our present gains and to continue the
implementation of tsca as a workable 
the most significant of our future activities is also the one we have to tackle
cma 
first  the oversight  while i had a rather uneventful 
ence of testifying before a senate subcommitte on toxic substances and
environmental oversight back in august of  the real game will be
played early this  perhaps in february or march in both the house
and the 
we expect the oversight hearings to be particularly tough as our opponents
seek to turn around some of the successes we have  
in the house before congressman  subcommittee we expect to see the
following issues to be pushed by the 
tsca should be amended to require testing of new chemicals
since industry is providing test data in less than  of
the 
the agency should not be allowed to accept negotiated testing
agreements as a substitute for test rules since these agreements
are 
the ability of the agency to regulate chemicals under tsca is
constrained by the need to balance risks and benefits and make
findings of unreasonable  this requires that tsca be
amended to reduce these 
the environmentalists have indicated they intend to open tsca for 
ments and we believe congressman plorio will be willing to  congress
man florio has already commissioned ota  of technology assessment   to make a study on the adequacy of data submitted on a 
  he commissioned the gao  accounting  to study
 pmn review process to include procedural and policy differences
between  and   the senate has commissioned gao 
accounting office to study the merits of negotiated testing versus testing

 our work is cut out for  within crac we have established an ad hoc
oversight committee chaired by myself with carl umland of exxon as  this consul  made up of our task group chairman and 
nated with the government relations committee through our  
jerry kinney of onion  is preparing position papers on these issues
and  we plan to enlist the help of our friends on the house 
committee to counter the environmental leanings of congressman florio and
others on the  we will welcome any and all help we can get as
we enter this oversight  our objective is to avoid damaging
amendments to 
while we expect our major confrontation with the environmentalists will be
in the  the climate in the senate is also not the most 
though the senate subcommittee is controlled by  the specific
members have environmental interests and we will again need to be well

as part of our preparation for  and for use in other public 
we are completing our survey on  company activity to reduce 
sonable  this  which your executive committee approved at our
fall meeting in chicago should provide valuable information for use at the
hearings to demonstrate that industry on its own has taken the action needed
to reduce unreasonable risks and that the  of  is 
 the data should help us indicate that significant changes to the
law are 
we have over  companies participating in the survey so we believe the
results will be  initial results appear to be following the
pattern seen in the pilot survey which we completed early in  the
companies have sent in their responses and our contractor is tabulating the
information for us  we expect to have an initial tabulation of the
results by january  for our  of course we will forward a copy
of the results of this survey to you prior to announcing it to the 
we expect we will be ready for public release around february 
getting back to the regulatory side of our  the agency has
announced they intend to publish final pmn rules by   and are
preparing an active  program for certain new  we have
reason to believe the agency has again heard us and will   from
the extensive pmn forms originally  while we have urged the agency
not to adopt a  we expect they will require one to encourage 
tency and organization of the pmn  we will be endeavoring to again
provide impact in the development of the final 
we expect to  activity will be based upon the implementation of
significant new use rules  and the various reporting rules for
chemicals in commercial  we could see some of these 
programs early this  we expect these will be used in only a handful
of cases but we are actively working to assure the criteria used to initiate
this activities are 
the pmn exemption proposal put forth by the epa  for the most 
the concepts offered by cma in its  where the agency has proposed
more extensive and burdensome  we have reacted through 
testimony and  discussion to offer alternatives which will
achieve the  and   we expect final rules on exemptions
by  and our new chemial task group now chaired by jerry hapka of
dupont will be working to bring these to 
cma 
the last major regulatory objective under tsca will be the establishment
of proper criteria to select and give priority to those chemicals which
may become the subject of  this is a part of tsca under which
the agency is still under criticism since there have been no final rules
regulating chemicals under tsca other than  which was written into
the act  the agency is working to develop a process for existing
chemicals  zn the past year we established under crac a new task group
chaired by fred hoerger of dow to work with the spa on this process 
 there are  or  chemicals that spa is now reviewing and we could
expect one or more of these to be the subject of proposed rules by the end
of  or early  controlling some aspects of  
 use or  he believe we are in a position to make this
process a reasonable one as it is 
in   saw major advances in the implementation of tsca and major
progress on the part of the epa in making the final rules and procedures
much more   through its  active members and the excellent
cma staff support we have  has been instrumental in achieving 
we said last year that a window existed with this administration to make
significant advances in implementing tsca in a reasonstie  we have gotten
number of rules through that 
 will present new  the most critical of which will be our
oversight hearings where we must hold our ground and solidify the gains we
have  we still believe tsca is a workable law when implemented in a
reasonable and timely  we will need to demonstrate that it is
working and that the goals of tsca to reduce unreasonable risk are being
 we will not seek to reopen tsca for   should this
 we are prepared to offer our suggested

half and will complete this assignment and my fourth year of crac membership

the year  has marked three major milestones in the reform and
improvement of the patent system better to meet the needs of fostering 
logical  procedures are now in place to obtain a higher quality patent
before  to obtain less costly determinations of patent validity
without expensive litigation and to obtain more certain application of the
patent laws in  progress has been more difficult in changing the
substantive law to restore a full patent term for products whose introduction
has been subject to regulatory  unfavorable changes in domestic federal
law to regulate contracts with employed inventors have been  so 
attempts by developing countries to force early consulsory licensing or 
cellation of patents have also been put  so  the year  will bring
renewed discussion on all three of these substantive  patent
term  employed inventors  and compulsory licensing of
patents in third world  it will also  we  renewed
discussion of two changes in the substantive  patent law regarding 
national  and renewed discussion about interference  inventorship
in the corporate setting and other  your cma patent and trademark
committee will work to help formulate and enunciate cma policy on these issues
and to communicate with cma member companies on developments in these 
 patent reform
  many cospanies can expect patent costs to go up next
year because of the  patent and trademark office  fee 
effective october   that represent the first fee increase in almost
  in combination with new management at the  patent and trademark
 the hiring of more  better examiner  better 
tenance of the search files and an overdue trial of automated 
these fees  we  bring a steady improvement in the system under
which patents are granted and trademarks are registered in the  we
expect several procedural changes to be discussed next year that will enable
the additional resources to be used to shorten the period it takes to
issue a patent or register a  while reducing the proportion that
are issued improperly because of such curable errors as prior art references
missing from the patent  search 
 alternative to  the reexamination system now in place is
designed to provide a quick and  administrative procedure to have an
issued patent reviewed by the pto for patentability against printed prior
art raising a new question of  while the courts  in 
willing to defer to the patent office on such  the use of reexamination
has been less than had been predicted by its  perhaps more time is
needed for patent owners and others to use this system more regularly as an
alternative to  in any  recent legislation has opened up
issues of patent validity and infringement as proper subjects for 

cma 

by next  we should begin to know whether or not this new alternative to
expensive patent litigation will be used  arbitration may be the
preferred route for deciding if sensitive commercial activity invalidates a
patent on either prior use or best mode  or avoids infringement for
technical reasons which neither party wishes to be made  reexamination
will remain the  alternative for dealing with printed prior 
 litigation  a major change in  has been the creation
of the court of appeals for the federal  which has appellate jurisdiction
over all cases arising under the patent  as well as over appeals from the
patent and trademark  by developing a uniform body of 
it is hoped that this court will eliminate forum shopping in patent 
because the court was formed by the merger of  one court with experience
in appeals from the patent and trademark office and from the international
trade commission and  another court with experience in claims against the
 this new appeals court can be expected to show a high level of
understanding of the technical and commercial significance of 
 legislation carried over
 patent term  the biggest disappointment this year has
been the failure to enact legislation extending the term of patents whose
effective term has been eroded by years of regulatory  as dick
waterman reported to you last  the cma patent and trademark committee had a
principal role in drafting this legislative  following the lead
of the pharmaceutical manufacturers  we hope to push this bill
into law during the next  the press of other business and opposition
by key senators and congressmen prevented this bill from being enacted in
spite of majority support in both 
 employed   two attempts were made last year
to regulate by federal law the contractual relationship between employed
 inventors and their  we expect these efforts to intensify next 
particularly in the area of defining fields in which the  inventions
are assigned to his employer and other fields in which the employer has
no  the topic of statutory compensation to employees when their
inventions are used commercially will also be  these issues will
be monitored  reconmiendations for cma positions will be 
if congress seems likely to act on either 
 international   developments
the major developments on the international front have been recent attempts
by developing countries to revise the paris  the basic international
treaty regarding patent  to permit a country to order cancellation or
compulsory licensing of a patent not locally worked within a few

 changes in the  substantive law regarding extraterritorial
application of   there are two provisions of  patent law
which differ from the laws of most other countries in a way that places a
 manufacturer at a competitive disadvantage in international  when
his sole patent protection relates to improved processes for making known
 as is often the case in the chemical  he cannot use the
courts to challenge those practicing the process abroad and importing the
 his remedy before the international trade commission has many other
 unrelated to patent  that he would not have to meet in a
normal civil  an analogous provision of  law provides no effective
remedy for the holder of a patent on a machine having several components
against another party who manufactures the consonants in the  for
assembly  we will be reviewing proposed legislation next year to
remedy both of these 
 changes in interference  we will also be reviewing
proposals to reform the interference practice used by the  patent and
trademark office to determine priority among inventors claiming the same
invention in order to expedite these  a symptom of problems
in this area is that a patent is now issuing on crystalline polypropylene that
could be enforceable until the end of the 
 other  other areas that we plan to review are the treatment
of related inventions by different combinations of inventors in the orporate
 uniform policies for ownership of  data and software
resulting from   and the possible implementation
of the examination chapter of the patent cooperation 
conclusion
the current political climate represents an unprecedented opportunity
to reform the entire patent system in the  to make patents reliable
assets for investors in  the increased costs and delays 
ciated with bringing innovative products and processes to market make the
need for enforceable patents and affordable enforcement procedures more
 we hope that  brings continued improvements in these areas

trade committee

this morning  be reporting to you on the work of  international
trade committee in  the second year of its formal  
obvious to all of us that in recent years chemical industry sales and
earnings have depended upon large volumes of  three measurements
  are on an unfortunate 
in  the dollar value of  chemical exports was  
in  the value slipped to 
for two consecutive  the trade surplus in chemicals  the excess
of exports over imports  has  the   and  dollar
values      billion and  
over the same   the share of industry sales going to the
export trade has declined from  percent to  
the two sides of our current trade reality are  chemical exports
are decreasing while at the same time imports are on the 
 another trade reality that the  chemical industry has to
reckon with as  and that is the swing toward protectionism we are
seeing all around the globe  including the  this industry is
confident of its ability to compete in world trade  to the extent that
we are not blocked from doing so by governmental  whether the
government be our own or that of a foreign  while the words
of the international trade  charter may say it more 
 a  version of our mission is to work to remove existing
barriers and to derail attempts to create new 
with this mission as our  this morning  be covering what i
see as the  major accomplishments during the year and the
major issues before us in 
first a word on 
in  two task groups were refocused and a new task group created 
bringing our task group number to  we broadened the mission of the
north american trade policy task croup to include all import matters
affecting cma member  the task  name was changed to
import policy task  we expanded the membership of our multinational
corporations task group and changed its name to the intergovernmental
organizations task group to better reflect its proper  early in
cma 
the year we formed an investment policy task group to more adequately
cover this policy area and to provide support to dexter baker who is now
chairman of the investment policy advisory committee set up by the trade
 
since i plan to cover  accomplishments by task group area of 
the investment group is a good place to  shortly after its 
the group focused on the subject of bilateral investment 
through its  we were able to give the  view on a model
treaty to united states trade representative  ambassador 
investment treaties specific to egypt and panama were also discussed
with 
this group also prepared and distributed to member companies a survey on
foreign investment to provide the committee with member input on specific
problem areas that should be   companies 
and the data provided is now being analyzed by the task 
i
turning to the intergovernmental task  a main concern of its members
last year was the    in the european 
as leo johnstone reported to you in  the  draft of
the proposal called for advance consultation with workers on a variety of
management decisions  including investments in other parts of the 
the association supported the joint national foreign trade 
council position on the issue and the heavily amended version that was
approved by the european parliament was clearly a defeat for its backers
and was viewed as resulting from effective lobbying by  
a major reason behind the formation of this task group was the variety
of activities concerning international companies going on in various
agencies of the united  during  these activities were 
tized from the  chemical industry  and a number of meetings
with  officials took place  including one with  ambassador

while developing countries often seem to be the loudest voices in the 
they are also loud in their demands for special treatment by individual
industrialized countries  notably the united states and particularly
with respect to our treatment of the products they wish us to 
the general system of preferences  is an important  recognition
of this  the system offers  entry of a wide variety of
commodity and finished  gsp became effective january   and
will expire on january   the ustr administers gsp and it and the
congress are expected to be holding hearings this year on its 
preparatory to our active involvement with this  the import policy
task group prepared and distributed to selected cma members a questionnaire
designed to gather data on member awareness of and concern about 
our position is now in the early development 
i

cma 
the  tariff schedule in general is getting cma attention due to the
program to  our schedule with the customs corporation council
 which is used by most of the  other industrialized
 late in  the international trade commission released
chapters  and  of the new  these deal with commodity inorganic
and organic   chapters  dealing with enduse chemical  are expected to be released in  the
entire project is scheduled to be concluded by july   with 
mentation of the new harmonized code set for  while unable to
take positions on individual  cma recognizes its potential
importance to members as some products will see significant tariff increases
or  because of  we sponsored  with socma and spi  a
trade seminar on the subject that was attended by  industry 
we will continue to supply timely information and procedural guidance to
member 
on a matter specific to this  the import policy task group
reviewed the   basin  which was a
 program of  tax incentives and supplemental aid to
the caribbean basin countries to assist their economic  cma
did not take a position on this  in that the bill currently
drafted does not offer significant chemical investment potential either
as an opportunity or threat for    we continue to
monitor the  
another piece of legislation on which we took no specific position was
the export trading company  which is now  this legislation 
 be helpful to smaller  and through the cma  we
informed members who might be interested in the subject about commerce
department and  chamber seminars dealing with 
during  a host of protectionist cries were raised in 
many of which prominently featured a new   our
export policy task group was active in an industry coalition supporting
senator  bill   which provides for extending section 
of the trade law to cover  intellectual property  and
foreign direct  in  cma endorsement of the danforth bill
 without amendments  was sent to the senate finance  no
real action took place on this bill in  but  consent further on
its outlook when i cover  
a position specific to the protection of intellectual property rights was
developed and forwarded to commerce secretary  the export task
group also prepared a position dealing with  
  has not been issued externally as  as we are awaiting
action by the business roundtable and the   who have the leads
on this 
cma 
our fifth task group has bean dealing with one specific policy issue 
that of the export of    the rescinding of
president  overly restrictive executive order was a direct result
of chemical industry  and a number of cma suggestions have been
incorporated in the present acceptable form of the proposed new order now
in the white  our objective all along has been to keep this as a
simple notification scheme  without any form of government control and
not tied to specific  so    to put the
industry stake here in  the wrong outcome on this one would
immediately put into jeopardy some half billion dollars worth of pesticides

in addition to issues worked mostly within our task  the committee
has been active in a number of other 
a primary area of activity has centered on petrochemical discussions
between the  and other  while discussions with the connon
market were dormant during  cma provided two groups of advisors to
assist the  trade representative and the department of 
 in preparing for and carrying out talks with japan and 
 efforts in the japanese talks were directed toward giving them a
better understanding of what they considered to be our unnatural advantage
in natural gas  mexican  while not yet  is
expected to be on the export of their products into the  leo johnstone
has led the  groups of industry advisors with excellent results
to  with respect to the mexican  the committee formulated a
set of proposed  objectives and passed these to 
one thing these discussion activities highlight is that  
with all its  is far from being alone in searching for 
last  delegations from cma and cefic met  at the 
request  to discuss common views with respect to a number of 
national trade 
a familiar response to a perceived problem is to initiate a  during
 six separate studies regarding various aspects of petrochemical
 were progressed by various   these include
the commerce  the international trade commission  
the  the world  and the office of technology 
the committee and member companies assisted to the degree possible with
 in connection with one of the international trade commission studies
 on investment performance requirements  the committee prepared a
 for the  on the  of the questionnaire
designed to provide its data  the  of these various studies
bureaucratic study often is not a precursor to  more times than 
a substitute for meaningful 
cma 
if these  studies were not  last year the
committee reported to you that we were working to develop a study of the
chemical  international trade  this was dropped as a
chemical industry  but an ad hoc group of industry members have
interested the american enterprise institute in conducting a wider study
of  trade  cma has reviewed and taken no exception to the
initial effort to scope the  the association will not be participating
as a financial supporterwith governmental and media interest in trade at seemingly an 
 the committee felt it worthwhile to develop for its own use a set
of general communication guidelines which put current and future trade
policy matters in 
on a related  the development of positions is effective only insofar
as they are  in addition to the specific targeting of position
papers  mentioned  late last year the committee put together
a compendium of its positions and background  this was distributed
at our october open meeting and subsequently mailed to each member company
trade   throughout the  trade contacts were
provided with information on a wide variety of trade related 
 ahead for us this 
the short answer is more of the 
 petrochemical discussions still will be with 
mexico is currently anticipated to be the most important in  but japan
talks could be  at any  canada also at any time could
initiate a request for  while in recent months european
talks have been  these too could

presidential executive order  as we  acceptable to  this

outlook is very 
we will continue to work closely with ustr and others as appropriate on

down to an  is more blessed to receive than   selective

presented in the context of legislation to reduce growing federal budget
deficits in significant part by increasing taxes on  tax measures
which are considered in this political context are judged primarily on
their ability to raise federal  rather than on merit or 
during this past year cma and its member companies were successful
largely by limiting   rather than by obtaining new

 was not a good year for the chemical industry in terms of  tax
 changes in  tax law adopted as the tax equity and fiscal
responsibility act of   now place the chemical industry in a
position worse than when this administration took  it is important
to note that the tefra changes were not as adverse proportionately for
other  such as basic metal production or oil 
how bad were the   in  the  legislation was
 many observers in the chemical industry viewed that event as
one of the worst that has ever befallen this  superfund calls
for the collection of about  billion over a   this is
an  amount of about  million per  of which the chemical
industry is paying  percent or  million per 
  actual
collections are somewhat less because of low industry operating 
the  percent reduction in investment tax credit costs the chemical industry
over  million  more than twice as much as  
the reduction in investment tax credit was only one part of the adverse
changes in 
 much of  adverse impact from tefra may not be felt by the
industry in  because of the poor overall condition of the

proposed alternative minimum tax was not  there was  legislation
making significant adverse changes in the  taxation of foreign source

rate of depreciation that was to have become effective in  and  was
lost with an impact in those years of more than  billion in cash for the

developments in the tax  to do this we carefully watch proposed

in developing new industry  we work towards a consensus  after

the president proposed to accelerate the scheduled third year individual
tax rate cut from july to january of   strong early warnings
from republican leaders on capitol hill convinced him that he did not have
the votes to support such a  congressional concern over rising
unemployment and federal deficit figures cast serious doubt on whether any
tax program could be passed in the  special 
the president also moved to demonstrate his concern over unemployment
and the  willingness to develop an effective jobs 
sensing that the highway program was the only available legislative vehicle
that could be passed in the   the president threw the
full weight of his office behind the transportation  proposal
to extend the highway trust fund and to increase the federal excise tax on
gasoline by  cents a gallon  these revenues intended to complete and 
build the  bridges and  on december  the house passed
the  proposal with relatively few changes and senate approval
was expected to  but not without a

issue of tax and trade  in early  the  trade

would introduce legislation to meet the objections to the domestic

voiced by european and canadian 
it was reported that in the meeting
of the  cabinet council just before thanksgiving there were
strong differences over the proper scope of any legislation to amend or to
replace the disc  trade ambassador brock and commerce secretary
baldridge strongly supported maintaining  tax incentives for trade
similar to  equally strong in their opposition to disc and any continued
tax support for american exports were treasury secretary regan and budget

a series of bills have been introduced during the  session
that would essentially freeze the wellhead prices of natural gas and extend

assistance to the elderly and those on fixed or low income who are adversely
impacted by increased natural gas  some legislative proposals further
abrogated existing contracts by calling for the renegotiation of certain
provisions or altering of the price escalator 
proponents of accelerated and complete deregulation of natural gas are
now faced with   various citizen and labor groups are
suggesting that natural gas decontrol is a matter of  or  and
that rhetoric is being taken up by a number of congressional 

 letters are being  and a concerted effort is being made
to attach language that would freeze gas prices to either the 
excise tax measure or a continuing resolution for 
the senate finance committee has been the forum for a good deal of the
debate on whether the highway tax should be amended to include a natural gas
price  the house has already passed a different version of a highway
gasoline excise tax to increase  senate floor action on the highway
tax is expected to begin december  or  and that bill could be the target
of a natural gas control floor  senator thomas  eagleton 
is spearheading the  the administration has not taken a visibly active
role in opposition to the various legislative proposals that would reregulate
gas on an interim  but a presidential veto could occur if a highway tax
bill passes that is loaded down with  
several key members of the senate energy and natural resources committee
have expressed opposition on jurisdictional and procedural grounds to any

 communications program reflects ths shift in
direction to an  balanced industry 
cations 
this advocacy campaign draws on the 
bined resources and perspectives of the 
government  technical and communications
 providing a stronger force with which the
association can communicate with  other
associations and  and the general 

  communications program is aimed at
developing an equitable environment in which to develop public

the communications  its task groups and the
cma staff are the backbone of this communications 
 these groups create elements that include news
relations and general public relations 
mews media activities are designed to voice industry
and association policy and programs to the 
these
reflect the  close relationship with government
relations and the  shift to targeted 
this program element grows in importance as our relationship
with the press consistently needs nurturing both from a
national and local community 
the media tour program
reached more than  by the first of january including
   radio and  newspaper interviews with
cma staff and science advisory group 
 this
kind of activity enhances cma and industry relationships with
the press and gives us one more positive step toward achieving
balanced 
another approach to broadening press relationships is the
placement of cma officers and executives on major speaking
 such as the detroit economic  the world affairs
council of pittsburgh and the executive club of 
the
first of these featured cma chairman simeral speaking on the
policy agenda for the chemical industry in  focusing on
the  international trade and environmental 
twenty reporters from national and trade publications 

this kind of activity creates a positive profile for
the 
the news media section will be instrumental in helping
to develop major communications efforts over the course of the
year focusing on specific critical issues such as hazardous
waste disposal  public 
these efforts will
include many aspects of the ongoing cma communications 
 special press kits to be used at the local  radio
broadcast and telsvision  issues advertising and
speaker 
an example of this kind of specialized
issue effort is the   program currently in effect
and targeted for four congressional 
this effort
includes media  which began in december in areas of
west  new york state and 
these will be
followed by radio broadcasts and issues advertising when the

the  a series of  newsfeatures distributed
biweekly to a  station  spontaneous newsfeeds
with actuality sent to anywhere from  to  
 television newsfeatures and expanded activity at

a prime example of the  that comes from such efforts is

remarks to cma board of directors
by william  metten 
 communications committee
january  
the communications committee appreciates this opportunity
to bring you  on our  communications 
 priorities and 
in the next few minutes i
would like to outline a new direction in the focus of our
communications  share with you several examples of how
cma communications activities support our   
 touch on the future communications challenges facing our

but  a brief overview of how the public perceives the
chemical industry may be of 
the negative perception
that the public has of our industry has not 
the public
believes that the industry is irresponsible in its management of
wastes and is unwilling to deal with critical environmental
issues unless forced by federal and state 
the  perception of us as bad guys is influenced and
reinforced by a news media which is steadily chipping away at
the private enterprise fabric of our  
that protray business and businessmen as dishonest and motivated
by money  the outcries of environmentalists and selfstyled protectors of the public 
 no  is  that opinion survey after opinion
survey shows such a negative public attitude toward our industry
with the hazardous waste issue the foremost issue preoccupying
the  
and like it or  perception equals
reality in the  
our cause is not aided either by the fact that the 
 because of economic and other political 
has not been able to provide the leadership necessary to influence
legislative activities to deal with the problems of our 
within the past six months  communications program has
undergone a significant change in 
three factors are
primarily responsible for bringing about this 
one will
certainly come as no surprise to anyone in this room  the
economy has not been kind to our 
in this adverse
economic  the communications committee recognized the
need to reduce communications  a decision consistent
with actions taken by many member 
as you  a
substantial reduction in cma communications expenditures occurred
in the print advertising 
as a result of eliminating the
national print advertising  the  chemcap assessment
has been reduced from  percent to  
the second factor contributing to a change in the direction
of our communications program is a closer liaison with 
government r lations 
cma 
a strong relationship between government relations and
communications is essential when you consider the necessity
for our  communications to be focused around and
in support of the legislative issues facing our 
a
stronger bridge has been built between the communications and
government relations committees for  of ideas
and planning communications strategies and building 
this is a relatively recent 
at this  both partners
are enthusiastic about the opportunities for coordinating cma
communications more closely with government relations 
we look forward to the day when this approach bears 
the third element of the new direction in our 
communications activities is a desire to try new and different
approaches in our ongoing commitment to reshape the 
negative perception of our 
we recognize that we are
locked into a constant and shifting battle for the  
standing and 
results are difficult to come 
victories
are 
but we must vote present on the issues and use every
means at our disposal to communicate the  accomplishments
and commitment on industry 
we have initiated two activities
which illustrate the use of innovative communications approaches
to accomplish these 
one involves a pilot regional
communications program in cooperation with the louisiana chemical

this program will be tailored to that  communications
 and the leadership is being provided by louisiana
chemical association and its member 
funds are being madti
available from our communications budget for one 
the 
ana experiment begins this 
we hope that the experience
gained will be useful in developing model communications programs
for use in other states to develop public policy support at the
grass roots 

another innovative approach involves a grass roots 
tions program in support of clean 
this is the first time
that we have targeted a single message within key congressional
districts to build a coalition of supporters and activate a public
relations campaign at the grass roots 
here  this is
a learning  and we are hopeful that it will produce
results which can be applied 
personally 
i am excited about these new approaches
and the new direction that our communications program is 
i know that our communications committee shares this 
the members of our committee  your employees  have contributed
greatly to shape and guide these new communications 
now i would like to touch on the other communications activities which continue to play an important role in  overall
communications 
cma 
i am referring to such activities 
 media tours which are planned around a specific
issue and targeted for maximum impact in geographical areas and
congressional 
media tours consistently delivered
 and we are increasing the tours in 
broadcast communications is another 
communications 
cma now broadcasts a regular series
of  radio features dedicated to major issues of the
association and distributed  to  
e
the balanced television newsfeed continues to be a key
ingredient in our news 
for  we fed a recent
feature on superfund via satellite to more than  
e
consumer information programming  this activity 
tinues to generate results and good will for our industry and
maintains mutually beneficial relations between cma and consum 
public  educational and other influential 
th
objective here is also to advocate our position on major issues
as well as provide a forum for member companies to talk about their
individual product 
at conventions like the american women in radio and 
 industry experts are interviewed on a variety of 
in the aftermath of the train derailment at  
 chemtrec staff and news service department turned some
adverse circumstances into a positive media 
in the time remaining i would like to take a prospective look
at the major issues confronting our industry and suggest some ways
that our communications committee is considering addressing the
issues in support of our  
the biggest single issue which adversely affects the 
perception
of our industry is hazardous waste 

standing efforts by our member companies and an ongoing program
by cma  the public perceives that they are at great risk
from chemical 
the hazardous waste issue has such a grip
on the national consciousness that this single issue affects the
 perception on other industry issues such as clean air and
clean 
later on  i will have the opportunity to 
dress the public perception of hazardous waste issues as part of
a waste management plan presentation to be considered by the
executive 
in  i would like to acknowledge the contribution of
individuals on our committee and thank you for contributing their
advice and counsel on the tough communications problems our
incustry is 
their efforts continue to make a real 
bution to our 
i also wish to acknowledge the efforts of
 communications staff whose enthusiasm and commitment on
behalf of our industry is a key element in the progress we have

iag is concerned with the international consequences of efforts by
national  groups of governments  international 
zations to manage the identification and control of chemical risks to
human health and the 
the  chemical industry trade associations and their member companies
have actively supported a constructive domestic policy on the 
cation and control of chemical risks to health and the  such
matters may cross national  as does the flow of chemical
substances and chemical industry  there is growing 
national initiative in the  safety and environmental  
it is necessary that the  chemical industry via iag develop and
support a constructive international policy to meet the need for
increased international understanding  and commitment  these

during the past three  iag has held numerous meetings with the
european council of chemical manufacturers federations  
prises many national chemical industry trade  including
those for countries within the european  this past year
members of iag traveled to japan to conduct discussions on matters of
testing and control of chemical substances with the japanese chemical
industry association  and through  the ministries of
international trade and industry  and health and  and

in addition to the multiplicity of laws affecting the trade of chemicals
between various nations is the  activity of supranational
 these include the european economic community  the
organization of economic  and development  chemicals
 the united nations environmental program  and a host
of technical and scientific programs that fall under various united
nations and other global governmental 
cma 
possibly the most important evidence of  activity is in the oecd
 at the recent high level meeting  the united states succeeded
in its  year attempt to avoid imposition of testing requirements for
new  in the form of  minimum  data set
 these requirements would have been placed on new chemicals prior
to manufacture in the  for domestic 
under an agreement worked out november  spearheaded by epa
 anne  oecd delegations endorsed a  proposal
that would allow individual oecd nations to select their own approaches
for reviewing new  this success is  to a large  to
 activities working closely with those of  business and
industry advisory committee  while in fact providing much of the
muscle and advocacy behind  positions to ensure that 
industries were not shorted in the international  in  our
success at these recent oecd meetings means that the  
requirements for  notifications on new chemical 
stances will remain unchanged for the  tsca will not have to be
amended
in this respect because of international pressures and
 other agreements which the  delegation obtained 
good laboratory practices to provide a reliable basis for
mutual acceptance of testing 
protection for confidential business 
agreement to consolidate and 
continue to expand oecd work on 
 interpretation  for initial hazard 
ment of 
rather
than
we are now at the beginning of a  year experience in which the
japanese requirements will  with tsca section   with the
european community  systems in its ten member  and with
the oecd mpd  as it is or will be implemented in other oecd
 such as australia and possibly 
i ag will have a major role in participating in this comparative
experience in the interest of international trade and against the
increasing demands for  if any changes in tsca section 
are seen to have  on review of the next  years global
experience with new  iag should have a critical role in that

 assessing the risk of existing chemicals will require
monitoring of the various national programs to minimize  to
assure
that trade disincentives are not 
and to speed
understanding of new  testing   how much of
this iag should or can do remains to be 
cma 
international compliance programs where iag can provide guidance
are those of  waste  occupational  and possibly
  the extent and depth of  involvement in
these  in terms of participation with other domestic and
international chemical industry  needs to be 
other
 activity in the  of  issue in the
european inventory of existing commercial chemicals  taught us
the importance of increasing direct contacts as early as possible with
the individual national chemical industry trade  while at
the same time coordinating with the regional  especially 
this lesson can be used in the continuing aspects of this  now
directed at the pmn  and probably also in the several different
labeling systems which need to be made compatible and ultimately
 these conflicting systems are now developing in different
 differences are evident in the methods by which chemicals are
classified by their  effect  such as  the same is
true for the language used on labels to warn about these  for
 there is the potential of warning about a cancer hazard in
 but not in the united  the implications of this
difference for product liability are  iag has formed a work
group to develop a route to an international consensus on this 
this group will coordinate with the aihc and  osh  as
well as counterpart organizations in the 
during the coming months and  iag must continue to formulate and
implement programs to deal with international chemical  we will
need to identify and analyze national and international health and
environmental issues of concern to the  chemical  as rising
expectations and concerns develop worldwide on chemical 
w will need to develop positions responsive to these  develop
strategy and action plans and use and coordinate appropriate industry

in managing these issues we must do more to establish and maintain
national and international relations necessary for effective 
tion and exchange of  to do so means working with other
trade associations in the  and in foreign  working with the
appropriate agencies and representatives of the   foreign
 wherever  and with international organizations
such as   
in our activities we continue to examine new channels for the flow of
information in order to identify issues and to develop positions on

response to inquiry
what  the chemical  position on public 
our industry is committed to protecting the public from the
health and safety risks of chemicals and waste disposal 
several government and private organizations have studied the
impact of chemicals and waste disposal sites on public health
but none has established on a scientific basis that there is a
broad health 
 the chemical industry strongly
supports and encourages continued data collection and analysis to
determine the extent of any possible health effects in this 
such data collection is already mandated by existing 
until the nature and scope of this issue is better understood it
would be unwise to create a broad new public health compensation

in the  current compensation systems such as
social    the courts and private
 should be adequate to protect individuals who may have
a legitimate basis for seeking 
the chemical industry is
prepared to cooperate in the  analysis and interpretation
of information needed to establish a sound understanding of the
health risks associated with waste 
j

would your industry support the asbestos coalition 
the chemical industry will not support the chemical supplement
to the asbestos 
since data does not exist that indicates
any major health effects from chemicals it would be totally erroneous

be allowed to lose sight of the fact that a complete cleanup
of all hazardous waste sites in the united states is another

in terms that are both believable and 
even at a

 the real effect when the tax becomes
centered on a very narrow revenue  of give or take seven
chemicals and give or take   is that an erosion
begins that moves production of the particular chemicals 

erosion may be more pernicious than 
that
cma 
erosion will soon  because for most of the affected
chemicals there is worldwide excess 
from the 
 of the chemical  the fact that the production
may move from united states sources to foreign sources may be

we can make a  positive argument for a

alternate sources of superfund revenue
discussion
in  the executive committee and board of directors approved the
recommendation of the superfund funding taste group for supplemental revenue
options for the superfund site cleanup  in  the recommendations
adopted 
o
to impose a tax of  per dry weight ton on the disposal of
hazardous waste to produce the first  million in tax revenues
for the superfund site cleanup 
o
to raise revenues over   maintain the existing feedstock
taxes with three principal amendments   adoption of technical
amendments   specifically exempt hydrocarbons used in
gasoline from separate taxation as   freeze level of
revenues to be raised from the current taxes at approximately
 million per 
o
to continue funding from government general revenues at  
or approximately  million per 
o
to provide epa borrowing authority of up to  million per annum
 group to develop 
the executive committee and board of directors directed the task group to
study further an arco proposal to tax certain corporate gross 
on may  edwin  holmer testified on behalf of cma before the senate
committee on environment and public works on superfund 
in that   holmer presented a proposed funding mechanism to
match annual epa spending needs of approximately   that
proposal includes the components discussed  and would raise 
 in  he noted that  million would be provided from
cost recoveries and interest for total superfund revenues of  
in response to the directive of the executive  the task group
met on may   to determine what is the preferred mechanism to 
or to  an additional  million per  the executive committee
specifically requested that the task group present a recommendation on
whether cma should adopt the arco proposal to impose a tax on corporate
gross  or if  what alternative financing mechanisms should be
adopted to raise this additional 
after extended  a majority of the task group declined to recommend
a tax on corporate gross receipts as an appropriate means to raise 
 it should be noted that the task group was closely divided on this
 and that the minority strongly supported the gross receipts 
in this  congress may consider the gross receipts  the value
added  and other general tax increase proposals in  to reduce the
federal budget 
cma 

the task group agreed that the preferred mechanism to finance the next 
million increment for the superfund program would be to provide epa with
  borrowing authority in that  the task group modified
its previous proposal on this 
the basic elements of the new proposal 
expanded borrowing authority should be considered a 
 that  the authority to borrow would be available only
to finance actual superfund site cleanup expenses after the
revenues in the trust fund have been 
expanded borrowing authority would be limited in any given year
to  
repayment of amounts borrowed should be amortized over a 
 installments of principal and interest should be paid
first from cost recoveries and  to the extent  from
trust fund 
the new borrowing authority would be repaid from cost recoveries 
through trust fund  from contributors to the   this
new authority would leverage tax payments to meet current epa spending
needs with the implied commitment of fund contributors to repay these
amounts over 
the second preferred option would be to appropriate from general government
revenues an additional  million per  the task group views the
added contribution from general  like the tax on corporate gross
 as a means to expand contributions to the fund from industry
and the public at 
the third preferred  but which is not endorsed by the task 
would be to modify or to expand the present cercla  possible modification
could 
o
taxing  toluene and xylene used in gasoline 
o
increasing the per barrel tax on petroleum from the present 
cents per barrel 
o
doubling the proposed tax on hazardous waste 
o
expanding the list of feedstocks subject to the cercla taxes to
include products named in recent 
o
increasing all cercla feedstock taxes to not more than  percent
of sales 
cma 

it should be  that the task group does not recommend anjr of
these tax increases at this  but that they may be preferable to doubling
the existing cercla

that cma endorse expanded epa   borrowing authority of up to

economic impact of cercla funding proposal  waste end tax
at its may    the cma executive committee was informed of the
existence of the superfund economic impact working group which is examining
the impact which fees included in different proposals for superfund 
authorization would have on the chemical  a paper presented at
that meeting argued that the petrochemical sector would be the industry
sector most affected by an increase in cercla feedstock taxes and those
taxes would likely exceed the petrochemical  ability to pay

the cma executive committee has requested that the superfund economic
impact working group consider the affect of the imposition of a  per ton
tax on the  such an analysis has been conducted based on a survey
where some  cma member companies reported on their total amount of waste
and its 
the analysis used the amount of waste disposed of in  as reported in
the aforementioned  and compared the  per ton fee with  sales

of profits and less than  percent of

suferfumd economic impact study
discussion
an interim report of the superfund economic impact study group was reviewed
for the executive committee on may  the report concentrated on the 
chemical feedstock tax which provides the largest portion of the hazardous
waste trust fund revenue and has the greatest amount of analytical data 
able in the public  the executive committee approved the summary paper
on the economic impact of increased feedstock taxes for use by association
representatives in superfund reauthorization discussions with 
 the group was directed to broaden the study to include the impact
of  taxes which exceeded the   of the cma proposal and
to also include other revenue proposals currently before 
subsequent to this    was introduced with a feedstock tax
and a  tax on disposal as the principal funding   rates were
four times greater than those proposed by cma for the feedstock tax and at least
three times greater for some major disposal categories in the  
it is therefore apparent that a cma economic impact statement must consider
how  feedstock and  tax concepts are economically superior to
cercla taxes
the cercla feedstock tax has been in effect for three years and irs provides
data on collections quarterly which is analyzed by product and number of 
 it is possible to compare the taxes paid with information in the public
domain on production  sales revenue and profits for the industry 
under  the industry paid taxes on  primary petrochemicals of 
million dollars  although this tax revenue is about  percent below

collections could not be compared with  since those products showed a
net loss for  and     would increase annual taxes to
more theui  million dollars and set the rate at more than  percent of

in order to get a rough assessment of the impact of a  tax on cma
 waste disposal quantities on a dry weight basis of  member
company respondents out of   cma member companies were compared on a

 ton tax on the liquids basis could be as much as  to 
on a dry weight  companies disposing of streams more dilute than
average  of  pay even higher rates and be penalized for water
added to make the waste disposal safer and improve 
 of payments
two econometric models which we hoped to adapt to show the impact of higher
taxes on petrochemical   and balance of payments were found
to be not sufficiently sensitive or convertible on a timely basis for that
 we are revising methodology to use an empirical approach to analysis
of past data to develop projections of economic  the results will
likely rely on examples rather than completely quantitative results but will

 compensation for waste site injuries
the uarep study has proceeded under conditions which precluded
 acquiring knowledge of its direction or potential  to
minimize  the task force has postulated four scenarios and
discussed  possible actions in response to  the scenarios are
as 
o
scenario  a major national public health problem exists as a
result of exposure to hazardous waste  a substantial
population is at 
a substantial number of exposed
persons have manifested chronic disease of a type reasonably
related to the  a substantial number of persons have
been exposed and have not as yet manifested a chronic disease
or its symptoms   but realistically fear the
onset of chronic 
o
scenario  a minor public health problem exists as a result
of exposure to hazardous waste  a small population is
at  a limited number of persons have manifested chronic
disease of a type reasonably related to the  a small
number of persons have been exposed and have not as yet
manifested chronic disease or its symptoms   but
realistically fear the onset of chronic 
o
scenario  the data generated by the study is 
equivocal or unverlflable so that no inferences may be drawn
concerning human health effects resulting from exposure to
hazardous waste 
o
scenario  no public health problem exists as a result of
exposure to hazardous waste sites in any population nor will
any population in the future suffer adverse health consequences as a result of exposure to hazardous waste 
while cka has no information from uapep on the

public health surveillance at waste  most of the
proposals related to  compensation have attempted to deal with
the issue in one of two   establish a  federal 
trative fund to reimburse alleged  and  change existing tort
law to shift the burden of proof to a defendant and force him to prove a
 the task croup recognized that both of these changes were
attempts to deal with the problem of  or the relationship
between exposure to a hazardous substance and a  causation has
been the central issue of debate on  
cma 
after two yeers of struggle with the causation  the task
group has been unable to develop any system that would change current
standards of scientific and legal  yet still be intellectually
 past experience with federal administrative funds clearly
illustrated the dangers of gradually increasing  along with an
almost geometric growth in fund  changes in burden of proof does
violence to scientific notions of cause and  there  
a real danger that such a change in the tort law will be carried over to
 compensation and product 
the task group agreed that a middle ground was  our goal
was to develop a positive program chat would deal with public
perceptions of the hazardous waste exposure 
we recommend that cma support a revision of section  and
 of cercla to provide for more site specific health studies and
medical monitoring at old hazardous waste  our proposed changes
to the statute would give the centers for disease control  new
authority to investigate health concerns around waste sites in
situations chat posed less than a public health emergency  public
emergencies can now be  cdc would be able to conduct
health status surveys and screening programs of people exposed to
hazardous 
our approach treats the  perception that old waste sices are
causing disease and illness as a public health problem rather than a
problem of how to deliver compensation under the  or any
proposed legal 
the objectives of our proposed changes to section   provide
greater flexibility than now exists to utilize that section for medical
 limit the surveillance to individuals demonstrating actual
exposure from hazardous substances  defined in  and 
ing application of tha section to site specific exposures from 
 sites rather chan ambient  the proposed statutory change
allows the administrator  discretion in developing the protocols
for such  it was the cask  consensus that we would
be better advised not to put too much detail in the  end instead
work with the applicable agency on the proper protocol or scheme used to
carry out the statutory 
 this approach allows us to build on the uaref 
under any of the possible results of that  the approach suggested
here could be 
o
insurance coverage for people exposed to waste site 
 in the event government health officials determine that people
adjacent to waste sites have been significantly exposed to hazardous
 the  health status of the exposed population would
be  to those who were  the uncertainty of contracting
a chronic disease will likely persist in the form of fear and 
cma 
the task croup is recommending adoption of private party insurance
policies for people exposed to hazardous waste  these would
be similar to the structured settlements of cort suits that some
companies have used to resolve environmental litigation  the task
group is not recommending legislative changes at this  but is
studying further whether federal government involvement in this matter
would be 
the insurance policy would apply to people exposed to waste site
substances but who have not manifested  at the election of
responsible parties who are identified and connected with a waste
 exposed population would be offered a  insurance
 this policy would cover periodic medical testing and
examination for evidence of a designated chronic disease or diseases
likely to be caused by the  these examinations would continue
for the life of the  if the disease  the policy
would pay all medical  lost wages or  burial 
and a lump sum for anxiety and psychological trauma associated with the
 an individual accepting the insurance coverage would waive
 tort rights against the responsible party or parties providing
the insurance 
the task group believes the private party insurance 
affords companies several advantages including reducing the fear 
nent accompanying the  two of these advantages 
eliminating litigation  and obtaining epidemiology data to better
understand cause and effect relationships between exposure to waste sice
substances and chronic  it offers the exposed population the
obvious benefits of medical examinations  if the designated disease
 health care and 
the utility of this option will depend on the extent to which
people have been exposed to waste site substances   the
number of people who potentially would qualify for this insurance 
the task group plans to work with insurance representatives to determine
the costs of this 
o
administrative  if it should become necessary to
establish a separate system to compensate people for chronic disease
caused by waste  the cask group recommends adoption of the
concepts and principles provided the executive committee in april 
cma would be prepared to argue chat the principles of 
    and delivery mechanism chat we
prepared last year should apply in any administrative fund that the
government tried to set  the task group has modified the original
damages principle proposed to the executive committee in  the
change involves capping any damages award to an eligible claimant and
offsetting it with money he received from employment or ocher
entitlement  other than for  the waste compensation
principles proposed a year ago for an administrative fund remain 
cma 
 of the task group believe an administrative fund for
hazardous waste compensation would be appropriate only under uarep
scenario  where the study shoved a major national health problem
 past experience with other government programs involving
industry  financed funds  the black lung  warrants
proceeding with an administrative fund only where other legal remedies
prove  such a situation might exist where large numbers of
claimants injured by waste site substances would swamp the tort system
and other compensation  until this occurred  the
task group believes a federal administrative fund should be 
o
federal cause of  in its simplest  a federal cause
of action would give plaintiffs a right of access to federal courts to
pursue their tort claims for injuries received from exposure to waste
site  such a right exists today under federal statute for
many  in modified  a federal cause of action might be
accompanied by other elements affecting liability such as causation
 shifting burdens of  and strict standards of
 once a federal cause of action became  court
interpretation and congressional tinkering could easily modify the
federal right as originally conceived by congress and adversely affect
 
for these  the task group believes there are significant
risks in endorsing a federal cause of action provision in any

workplace disease compensation
background
the  compensation laws of all  states provide broad
coverage for disability or death due to occupationally related 
the administrative system in place in the states are fairly efficient in
their operations and are designed to deliver prompt benefits at a low
transaction  benefit funding mechanisms in use by 
employers and insurance carriers are reliable and reasonably 
no state program has yet experienced unmanageable numbers of
occupational disease 
while the existing workplace benefit systems are  there has
been a growing perception that workplace disease victims are not treated
fairly under  compensation  although state laws vary
 criticisms of the existing system suggest  that benefit
amounts paid are coo   that arbitrary notice and filing
limitations operate to bar many otherwise valid  and  chat
proof of occupational causation is too difficult or costly to 
some or all of these views are shared by organized  some other
employee  some  some  and some prominent

from an  or   it is clear that
workplace disease claims  with increasing  finding their
way into the tort  in the case of a workplace exposure to a
known or suspected toxic  a tort theory of recovery may be
sustained against a manufacturer of the  or in some 
against the employer  on the basis of traditional products
liability concepts or various creative theories which seek to avoid the
exclusive remedy protections in state  compensation 
resorting to the tort  with its potential for much higher 
higher   and sympathetic jury  appears to be a
course that is pursued with increasing 
reform activities
dissatisfaction with the existing  compensation systems of
the states coupled vlth the asbestos disease litigation crisis which has
materialized has genarated considerable activity in the past  the
most prominent of these efforts are as 
o
in  and again in  congressman george miller 
 introduced legislation to create a federally administered
occupational disease compensation program funded by  and
to some extent by product  this  which
focused on asbestos and radon  but could easily be
expanded to other  is now dormant but is not 
o
in june  the crum and forster insurance company issued a
set of comprehensive proposals to reform state 
compensation 
cma 
o
the  industry trade associations together with state
 compensation program administrators are now involved in an
effort to propose comprehensive system 
o
the   union  has assumed an
active role in pursuing  reforms and favors a
federalized benefit system and continued access to the tort 
o
the  chamber of commerce has announced its support for
reform of state  compensation 
o
the business round table is commissioning studies of workplace
disease reform funding and mechanisms for determining occupational
causation of 
o
a number of asbestos manufacturers have drafted legislation to
create a supplemental federally administered compensation program
for asbestos disease  the proposal has no congressional
sponsorship at this 
o
the kasten bill  which would establish mandatory federal
standards for product liability suits proposes to integrate
 compensation and tort 
 public compensation task group has monitored all of these
activities and had undertaken an independent investigation of the
matters at issue from the prospective of the chemical manufacturing
 it appears that there are substantial industry interests at
stake and that those interests are focused primarily on tha increasing
spillover of workplace disease claims into the tort  a better
integration of tha two systems and more rational mathods for
distributing workplace disease liabilities are objectives which merit
the careful attention of the  the obligation to promote the
equitable compensation of chemical industry workers afflicted by
occupational  and the prevention of disease are also identified
as areas of substantial 
 these aspects of the universe of workpiece disease
concerns cannot be addressed apart from the interests of other involved
 in addressing the larger context the committee has identified
 general target principles to aid in the evaluation of tvolving
 compensation reform 
target principles and objectives for  compensation reform
v

if occupational disease compensation reform
 the reforms agreed upon should actively promote disease
prevention and involve employers and employees in prevention


the creation of a new federal occupational
disease compensation system is not 
delivery 
occupational disease victims should be
equitably compensated within existing state  compensation

exclusive 
 compensation must be the exclusive
remedy for disability or death caused by workplace  a
 compensation claim must be pursued prior to any effort to
seek tort recovery against a third party and that recovery should
be reduced by the current value of  compensation benefits
including medical care   subrogation rights and
 rights  to contribution or indemnity should be
  compensation reform should be consistent and
integrated with product liability reforms endorsed by the chemical
 it is appropriate to explore proposed mechanisms to
eliminate tort suits altogether in workplace disease claims through
manufacturer participation in  compensation benefit


disability or death attributable to an occupational
disease should be compensated but eligibility decisions must be
based upon established and uniform scientific standards with
sufficient flexibility co encompass the extraordinary 

occupational causation should be determined by
occupational disease experts using  uniform scientific
criteria davalopcd by scientists in light of the best information
 presumptions and similar arbitrary legal devices are
incompatible with evolving  standards and are

multiple  a disease traced to multiple causes is not
compensated unless its occupational origins are medically

statute of  a claim should be filed within one year
from the date of actual or imputed discovery that an occupational
disease has been manifested or within one year from death due to an
occupational 
 and definitional 
arbitrary notice of claim
requirements and unscientific or unfair definitional limitations
which preclude recovery in occupational disease claims should be


an employer should be liable for disability
compensation only to the extent that the disability is caused by
occupational  death benefits are appropriate only if death
was significantly related to or materially caused by occupational
 disability and death inquiries are properly made by
medical 
 cash benefits paid should be computed in light of actual
wages  subject to statutory maxima and  in latent
disease  benefits should not be unreasonably low solely
because the last exposure occurred years  medical care
should be available without arbitrary 
 disease compensation benefits are properly reduced only
by social security old age 

disease compensation benefits are properly paid by
the last employer exposing the worker to a hazardous substance or

 benefits liabilities must be insurable through existing
 compensation insurance 
 occupational disease compensation system reforms
should be   any retroactive application of
reforms must carry back exclusive remedy protections if benefit
obligations are extended to cover past incidences of 
alternatives and options under review
at this time there is no apparent need to support or propose
substantial changes in the occupational disease compensation
systems of the  current recommended options 
a
o
take no action to change existing 
o
support modest state system reforms in statutes of
 medical  
o
continue to monitor ongoing efforts pursued by  develop
and refine cma positions and 
o
oppose federal involvement in occupational disease 
if more extensive occupational disease reform proposals gain
 and there is a likelihood chat some will in the next year
or  the development and consideration of creative alternatives
may be essential to a realization of chemical industry 
a number of promising alternatives and options have surfaced within
the committee and are the subject of continuing

surveillance system with traditional state 
compensation programs through a scries of economic incentives

include lover transaction  better medical records
compiled by  medical specialists for use if

international trade issues continue to be an area of high 
as reported  the current recession has promoted various types of 
tectionisms all around the  the gatt ministerial meeting to be held in
november will be extremely important for setting the direction of international
trade in the  a prime item on the   agenda for that meeting is to
obtain a recommitment to free trade as well as to complete certain items left
over from the tokyo  in  it is planned that the gatt agreements
be expanded into services  as    and 
 plus an investment code and expansion and redefinition of the
generalizations system of  trade relations with europe are not
at their healthiest state in view of the  sanctions regarding the soviet
gas pipeline and the  duty decision regarding steel imports
into the united states from  on the other  the gatt ministerial
could not come at a more appropriate time from the standpoint of trying to
head off conditions which could escalate into trade retaliation and a 
enactment of the  bill of the  which magnified and prolonged
the great  there are just a few items i would like to touch on 
day which are covered generally in your briefing  some of which deserve
some

developments in regard to further discussions with the  although
there continues to be some   the european
chemical industry appears to be more preoccupied with internal 
tions in seeking means of rationalizing the significant 
that  there has been considerable activity regarding 
tions for talks with  including direct 
tn setting the  plus two meetings with the department of commerce
by the panel of advisors from a number of cma member  the
advisors that your and other cma companies have made available are 
deed knowledgeable and experienced and are making significant 
 the greatest challenge at this time is to define objectives
and reach a consensus on objectives among the advisors and with the
department of  work is proceeding along these lines and the
international trade committee of the cma is actively pursuing 
the first meeting with the government of mexico has been scheduled for
sometime in   i made a trip to mexico recently and the
task force of the international trade committee has considered the
matter and we are recommending to the department of commerce that the
cma 
october meeting be deferred until sometime after the first of
december when the new government of mexico takes  it is not
felt that meetings prior to that time would be  the
present chaotic economic conditions in mexico are also a factor in
this 
there have been no meetings held with japan although we 
tinue to hear that a meeting will be requested by  it is also
possible that sometime in the near future we will get a similar 
quest from 
 competitive assessment studies are being conducted by the
international trade commission and independently by the department of
commerce regarding the   petrochemical  the purpose of
these studies is to attempt to assess the impact of actions and policies by other governments on the competitiveness of the   chemical
industry and are significant to us in that they will no doubt form the
basis for the attitude of the   government regarding our 
cal industry in trade negotiations in the  a number of companies
have been asked for  these studies and we will hopefully be
able to see early drafts in order that inaccuracies and 
ings are not 
 a very significant item which is coming from various 
tions including the industry policy advisory  as well as
through other  is the dangerous and insidious vredeling proposal
being considered in the eec governmental  while most of you may
be familiar with the vredeling  i find that some are  so i
would like to describe it  this proposal would be a directive
regarding workers rights in the community which extends from ec practice
of local information exchange and consultation to the world  it
would require annual disclosure of information by management to employee
representatives and prior consultation with labor representatives 
ing major corporate worldwide activities and decisions including 
shifts in  plant closings and even introduction of new 
nology into existing  this directive is for companies employing
at least  employees in ec  it would require that each year
the parent   company would submit information to the management of
its ec subsidiaries which would in turn provide it to the local union
labor representatives covering the parent  worldwide activities
related to its economic and financial  the possible 
ment of the  products and  it would include production
and investment  manufacturing and working  including
new working  technological innovations and health and 
the subsidiaries would be required to consult with the employee 
sentatives at least  days prior to any corporate decision which is
likely to have a substantial affect on the  interest with a
view to reaching agreement on the measure  the company must 
pone any decision until the union opinion is received or until the 
period has  in  employees at any other subsidiary than
the one directly affected may also demand   the proposed
cma

directive also contains provisions under which the employee 
tive is authorized to open consultation with the parent company 
ment under a   the employee representative will be
granted appeal rights to tribunal or other national authorities in the
event a management fails to fulfill the provisions of the 
 of  has numerous drawbacks which include an 
reach giving unions the ability to negotiate with  
panies on global corporate plans and at the corporate rather than the
individual plant  it could involve submission of data which may be
in violation of securities law and sec  access to corporate
confidential or proprietary information and establishing a precedent
guaranteeing worker consultation on an international 
this directive is now before the european parliament for a vote
the week of september  the ec commission are to reconsider and 
bly redraft the directive for consideration by the ec council of ministers
in mid to late  if  the individual member states would be
required to implement the directive through national 
this directive has become highly political and represents a major
priority for the european trade confederation which has effectively 
bied for  business lobbying on vredeling in the   is coordinated
through the national foreigh trade  the   council for 
national  the   chamber of  and the  
the lobbying took the form that this proposal is so bad that it should
simply be  present wisdom is that since some form of vredeling
will be  lobbying should take the form of attempting to revise the
proposal to something that can be lived  ivor richard of great
britain is the commission member who will be in charge of the redrafting
and is the guru of the vredeling  having inherited this role from
vredeling upon the   richard has indicated in speeches
and other discussions that he is flexible as to the final 
at the present  the cma position regarding vredeling is being
formulated and should be forthcoming in the near   in the

a conference agreement which was remarkably close to the package reported by the

agreement affecting capital formation 
o
reduction of acrs  and investment tax credit
the conference agreement would reduce the basis of property
for acrs purposes by  the amount of the investment
tax credit  energy tax  in  the effect
of this provision would be to reduce the value of the 
ment tax credit from  percent to approximately  
as  businesses could continue to take full acrs

investment by  corporations in puerto rico would be

acceleration of corporate estimated tax payments and would
impose additional limitations on corporate pension contributions
and 
the conferees rejected a last minute effort of a business coalition to reduct
the  impact on capital formation and corporate

democrats for any proposal to compromise on this  in  there is
concern that if action is not taken to reduce acrs this  the budget deficits

introduction
the engineering advisory committee is concerned with all
engineering aspects of chemical  we do 
tively what would be difficult to achieve  our
scope includes   operation and 
while there are many other engineering 
this cma committee is the only one devoted strictly to chemical
industry 
if we  speak for the chemical 
who 
most of our effort focuses on developing national codes
and standards which are acceptable to the chemical 
beyond that we sponsor forums on subjects of common 
for example computerized process control  recently
we added improved support of education to our 
in last   i talked about our work on 
lectrical     and relief
systems and the codes and standards governing  then i
presented an overview of the private sector standards 
its organization and critical importance to the chemical

 i will discuss in detail two subjects i mentioned
briefly last year so that you can have a better understanding
of the scope of this  then i will describe our
latest 
engineers can be accused of being detail  we
 someone must  a chemical plant is made up of millions
of       
   nuts and  each must do
what it is intended to  and practically all of them are
specified by one or more national 
it is a good
thing they 
if  every company would have to do for
itself what has been done  can you afford 
early in your  most of you were probably equally
concerned with 
remember  the details are still
 and each one must be handled  where we 
 do it 
cma 
electrical codes and standards
in past  you have heard about the work of our
electrical codes  standards task group to protect our 
interest by keeping the national electrical code  we
have millions of dollars at  the code is amended and
reissued on a three year  following very involved 
 there are roughly  proposals for change to the
 code for reissue in  of  response is 
priate on perhaps  and intense effort on  
we cannot rest on our  once we have successfully
defended favorable amendments and resisted those which are
 the whole process starts  many of the sam
issues arise year after  code after  it is not
feasible for member companies to face this task 
a concerted effort is 
as far back as  the code has required on electric

a remote controller disconnecting means capable of
being locked in the open  or
a manual switch located within sight of a motor to
disconnect the motor from its source of 
a pushbutton and remote magnetic switch would be common
to 
in other  lock it out in a
motor control center or disconnect it at the pump in sight
of the  note the underlined word  
it has been
propsed  is  and probably will be proposed
again to change that or to 
sounds  just one more

a typical pump installation in a hazardous area consists
of a   oil immersed pushbutton  straightforward minimum 
remote from the pump is a motor control  push
the button at the pump and a magnetic switch in the control
center  also  is a lockable switch separate
from the magnetic 
the magnetic switch is rated for the motor size and can
be opened safely under 
since these are usually located
in areas having less demanding hazard  they
have less
stringent and less expensive design 
now consider the same pump installation with a safety
switch for each 
if the proposed change were 
this is what would be  hazard rated switch  price
  installation cost   total  per 
cma 
not only  but potentially 
if this switch
at the pump is opened under  it will 
if not 
power  it could 
i will leave it up to you to estimate the cost of this
unnecessary complication on each new motor  
active application has   but some zealot may
try it at any  retrofit would cost more like  per
motor and a modest size chemical plant will have upward of
 such 
process control systems
now  leave the code  try a different 
and explore a new  computerized process control 
it is  exciting and  sounds like a
description of parts of the napa 
but like the 
it has its   we have good guides  our
process control task 
on may  and  the  group conducted its third
process computer users  half a day was devoted to
distributed control  unique to this session were
presentations by  member  a professor and
a journal 
this was followed by discussions of  
process  retrofit of existing  and integrated
control 
integrated control systems are those which
 combine distributed regulatory control systems and management
information 
we have heard the term distributed control systems for
the last several 
it you are like  you had an idea
of what was meant but were a little 
in a simplified distributed  there is something
to be  for instance a  a signal is 
this indicates the current 
it is received by the

remarks to cma board of directors
by robert   chairman
government relations committee
august  
i am pleased to have this opportunity to present the annual grc 
x would like to call your attention to the written  previously 
tributed to  particularly section     committee objectives
and  section   report on the substantive  and
section  major legislative issues timetables and priorities as i will
not cover these matters in my 
last year we reported on the implications of the political changes
brought about by the election of president reagan and a republican senate
and how these changes might  on the chemical  effect the role
of the grc and our legislative  we mentioned that the economic
  budget  and social security reform would dominate the
time and attention of both the administration and congress and that we did
not expect major environmental or health legislation to pass in  in
 we stated that these issues would be put off until  bringing
them into consideration during an election  thus making it even more
difficult to achieve substantial  we also stated that this did
not mean that efforts should not be made to amend key  but we
had to be realistic about our chances for  we pointed out that
significant legislation might be set aside and no final action taken until

this now appears to be the 
we are greatly disappointed that the seemingly favorable political
makeup of the administration and congress did not produce  but
what has happened was not totally 
 we are continuing to work for comprehensive changes in a
number of  and the organizational objectives we achieved last year
place us in a much stronger position to advocate change than in the 
by a more systematic focus on strategy and  improving communications
and coordination within the cma structure and continuing efforts to educate
members of congress and administration officials with  positions
and good backup  positions on the issues have been changing for the

it is against this background that the grc critiqued its activities and
developed our objectives for the coming  the major question we asked
ourselves was how can we do better and what are the things we have to do to
be 
cma 
we examined the various factors that impact upon the legislative
process and the roles various institutions play in influencing that 
the  public understanding of the chemical
industry and media influence on 
business coalitions in 
 the grc  washington representatives
and the 
the chemical industry and its political 
chemical industry issues and 
i would like to cover just two of those 
 one of the essential ingredients in setting the scene for
achieving legislative success   why is it when our
industry advocates changes in legislation that the public perceives it
as an attempt to gut a law that protects them and the environment and that
our sole reason for wanting change is  why does this misconception
carry over to the congress which gives us sympathy and  but
out of fear of public opinion will not vote to support responsible changes
that are well justified on the merits and by good  the main
reason is the single message persistently carried by the  influenced
by environmental  that  changes gut the  and
that industry wants change only to save  this    substantiated by a few isolated examples from the 
but presented as a  has created a total misconception of
the chemical 
to accomplish our  legislative  the grc feels it is
essential that we take the necessary actions to clear up these 
ceptions by better coordination of our communications program with our
legislative 
we will identify those issues of  prioritize  set
goals and  assist in developing communications that are 
tive in the legislative  and create a new sense of direction and

the grc will take action jointly with the conmunications committee
to deal with the  we have voted to form a task group on 
 to oversee these  and through this 
target  
the second essential ingredient is what we referred to in our report
as  the chemical industry has considerable political clout  you
want to call it  but we are not sure that this clout is being used
in the most effective  this is a sensitive area and one we are 
cma 
cant to discuss because it could be misinterpreted as interfering with
this is not the  we are all in the same
boat on these issues even though legislation may impact differently on
individual  we are all affected by the passage of legislation
that calls for further regulation of our  we either sink or
swim  what we will be trying to do is prudently direct and
utilize this clout to accomplish  legislative 
internal company 
we plan a number of actions to gather information on just where
the industry stands and the details of these activities are spelled out
in section viii of our  we will need your personal commitment and
support in this 
another sensitive area i would like to mention is ceo involvement in
this  there are times where certain  contacts must be
made within the administration or with the congressional 
some cases this already has been  it is our opinion that we can
only achieve credibility at that level by representation from the 
the hired guns can go only so  the system calls for bringing in
the big guns on specific issues where an appropriate relationship 
this involvement will be requested through the proper cma channels and
here again we ask you 
we believe the committee plans and objectives for  and  of 
proving  working in coalitions and focusing on influence
energetically pursued will go a long way toward enhancing our chances of
achieving our legislative 
a look at the future
t
as far as the executive branch is  we are being listened
to and we have not been faced with a flow of new  deregulation
has not produced the changes we had hoped for but there has been 
this takes  the reform movement has lost some momentum as efa 
to a lesser  osha have baen under political  this is apparent
in legislation being considered by congress in that a number of amendments
to various laws are designed to force epa into taking action or handcuffing
them where they have used their discretion on issues the environmentalists
hold 
action by the administration in lobbying for changes in environmental
legislation is  the white house is keenly aware that public
opinion holds little sympathy for amendments to  health and
safety laws and is keeping a low profile on the 
the  line is that we cannot expect too much executive branch
support on environmental legislation at this   we should be
alert to the signals that the white house is concerned about its image on
cma 
environmental  and in order to neutralize this issue we can expect
some administrative action  to show their concern for those

as far as congress is  the votes in the house on  and
clean air in the house and senate causes great  many months of
work with the congressional committees in hammering out compromises have
easily gone down to defeat on the floor of congress because of the emotional
and political climate that exists 
what we are seeing today is a number of battles in a war where the
outcome is still in 
at this stage we do not expect any major environmental legislation to
pass this session of 
 at forecast on specific issues in
section  this forecast could change as the politics of the issues are
so complex it is difficult to give a precise   there will
be little time to deal with these issues between the time congress returns
september  and adjourns the  week in  we are continuing to
work for comprehensive and constructive changes in the laws being considered
and this pressure is having the effect of extending the 
what about    we believe most of these issues will be
addressed in  what will be the political situation at that  the
outcome of the  elections will determine the character of the next
 there are as many opinions on what the character might be as there
are people who make  we  qualified to predict but some
experts do not feel the change will be all that  republicans are
predicted to maintain control of the senate and will not loose a significant
number of seats in the 
a key factor in    impacting on legislation will be the shape
of the economy and the jobs  since  is a presidential election 
what takes place in  will determine the issues of the   and
what congress and the administration believes to be public opinion will bias
consideration of  health and safety  this is one
of the reasons we believe our communications efforts are 
we cannot be sure of the answers to those questions at this  we
can only be sure that under any set of political circumstances our goals will
not be easy to  we are confident that the approach  have developed
to deal with these issues will serve us well under any circumstances and in
the long haul lead to 
we will not be disappointed if legislation is not passed during this
congress because in most cases what is being considered is worse 
or little better  what now  to say that the situation will
only get worse next year could be interpreted as meaning we do not have
much confidence in our positions and we should not accept

 environmental management committee
august  
earlier this  in a conversation with the chairman of the

 food score is a small negative   probably not that  but
vc aust run hard to stay in the same 
the environmental management committee has several key messages to
bring to the  and x appreciate this opportunity to address the
environmental issues that impact the chemical 
last    the emc  made several 
vations about  ahead to this    year we have just
 his remarks are a useful point of 
emc identified nine issues we felt would require the major part of
our  those issues  of  the caa legislative
 the water permits program and related water regulation were
 followed by rcba and superfund  ve then listed several
 issues common to all or several of the  regulatory
 good  economic consideration of  and the state
issues were the major   in  the emc
members and cma staffers can be pleased with their crystal  with
  we  need to change  the next part of my
presentation is to answer the obvious  you were so smart
about predicting the  what did you do about 
 let me say that the emc was adequately resourced by the
b  we had good support from the member  and the staff
delivered for us time and time  we managed our resources 
our outside expenditures were  of   was expended as
 the remainder was shifted to more  higher priority
projects that surfaced during the  as we constantly monitored our
resources to ensure maximum 
there were a number of accomplishments that are worthwhile 
ve selected six that are among the most  as one analyzes these
 we can very nicely use them to give you a better insight into how
emc does its  in addition to the type of results 
t
of the six results reported  two have to do with  one
vitb  and three with solid    rcra and two 
cma 
national pollutant discharge elimination system regulations  
after three years of extensive    and other
parties have concluded a settlement agreement on  of  issues raised
as part of litigation challenging the npdes implementing 
the settlement agreement is highly favorable to  the key points
are as 
permit application requirements have been 
there is a substantial increase in flexibility for calculating more
favorable numerical permit limitations which should result in
reduced treatment 
procedures for challenging permit conditions will be more
 this should reduce the cost and manpower needed to
secure acceptable final permit  and
dischargers will have increased flexibility in avoiding noncompliance penalties when violations occur as a result of
inadvertent or unknown 
fourteen of the reauining issues have been set aside for litigation
later during appropriate permitting  as a  the actual
number of issues to be briefed with the court of appeals has been limited
to a reasonable  thereby achieving our secondary objective of
reducing cost of managing the 
  study
over the last year and a  cma and epa jointly managed a 
operative  study to ascertain the removal efficiency of toxic
organic pollutants by existing chemical industry biological 
 in a recent cma consultants report on the  it was
found that current  biological treatment is doing an excellent
job in removing toxic organic pollutants from cheatical waste 
over  percent removal of toxics was  the study provides epa
with the best  data on the removal efficiency of biological
treatment for toxic organics and should play a key role in  
ment of effluent guidelines for the   and synthetic
chemical  we hope epa will use this data to conclude that no
additional technology beyond current  and operated biological
treatment is needed to define bat  available control technology
economically  much of our effort this next year will be
devoted to this 
clean air act amendments
as you all  a lot of  effort over the last two and a half
years has been directed at clean air act  with the government
relations  we have been pursuing a strategy to obtain relief
fr m current bureaucratic constraints in the act and to obtain more
 clean air 
cma 
many of the reforms we are seeking have been adopted at one time or
another by the house  these include better psd and 
 and streamlined sip  it is important that we get a bill
through with these  at the same  there are 
principally in the hazardous air pollutants  the  coalition
bss demonstrated far greater impact than industry or the administration had
 it is clear that this part of the act will be changed whenever
amendments are  ve are working hard now to make sure these changes
include needed improvements  protecting our  
rcra implementing regulations
cma over the past several years has been extensively involved in
discussions with epa and other concerned parties over  implementing
regulations for subpart c of rcra concerning hazardous  several
of the discussions  in  settlement negotiations of outstanding
judicial challenges to the prior  implementing regulations
that were technically incorrect or that imposed inappropriately stringent
requirements that offered no commensurate environmental  over
the past  the  efforts have begun to bear some significant 
one example is  recognition of the chemical  number one
concern that the present regulatory system inappropriately created a 
incentive for the chemical industry to internally reuse and recycle 
epa is now finalizing a proposed revision of its definition of solid waste
that will rectify this concern by essentially excluding industry internal
reuse and recycling of wastes from the hazardous waste  a second
example is the  revision of the mixture rule by redefining which
wastewater   this modification removes  chemical
industry surface impoundments from the hazardous waste   of which
would probably have needed 
hazardous waste site management plan
pursuant to directions from the board that the hazardous waste
response center direct its efforts to assistance for member companies in
disposal site  the task group has managed the preparation and
publication this spring of the definitive work on waste site sunagement
  hazardous waste site management  the document has
been designed to aid in the development of site management plans for
clean up of sites and to assist in mitigating any potential or actual
adverse environmental  the site management plan is being used by
member companies and federal and state agencies as a critical management
tool in resolving health  environmental problems created by hazardous
wastes in inactive disposal 
superfund implementation
as you are all well  superfund and its implementation is an
exceedingly high priority issue for the emc and the chemical 
the resource commitment we have made to date in order to obtain a
reasonable implementation of superfund has definitely been a costeffective  in this  epa has just  promulgated
cma 
 final revisions to the national contingency  these are 
sistent vith the positions that cma has advocated on this  the
key points 
no  standard for cleanup between fund financed versus privately
financed 
fund financed cleanups should generally be tied to the priority list
of  and
a flexible standard as to how clean a site would have to be under a
superfund cleanup 
although several significant issues still remain to be addressed
 mining site cleanup  state superfund  tort law
and waste end  the industry advocacy effort has resulted thus
far in aore reasonable iapleaentation by epa than first 
after this brief description of six key   would like to use
a few slides to give you an insight into the aanageaent of issues by the
 ve will focus on areas qf   and 
in each  the issues are listed on the  in the first
 the area of impact is indicated on the  the areas listed
are   it is of interest that the emc with cma staff
moves effectively across these four areas with a large number of 
as you can see from the  frequently our efforts have impact in
more than one of these 
in the next  the same six issues are listed again to show the
key resources used for each of the  of  cma staff is involved
in every  but the comparative effort varies from issue to 
in the final two  we focus on the bottom  justifications
are arbitrarily broken into four  once  we can win in
more than one  as an  we must improve on expressing our
actions in terms of positive impact on the  for 
the  study shows that procedures already in place have reduced
pollutants in water by hundreds of thousands of tons over that expected
by  the industry and the administration are interested in costeffective    well we  but the public wants to hear
what happens to the  ve must provide that information for
our own  and learn to do it    our formal comments
on legislation and  in our casual discussions with the influence
 as well as our chemcap 
 let us look  using the previous  i will discuss

with the  and mood of congress presently and in the next
 we anticipate ve will be swinging  given the other option
of   we shall continue to paddle like  with good
technical support and policy guidance through  we expect to reach our
goal of  environmentally responsible 
the regulatory arena will be active for virtually every major
environmental  as wayne jaeschke reported last  it was
demonstrated that it takes more effort and resources to participate in a
cooperative regulatory atmosphere than it does to object in the hostile
environment that existed two years  now is our chance to be part of
the 
the emc thinks there are several watchouts during the coming 
some are    are  let me list some of

 hard to predict when a groundwater incident will be
used against industry the way  love canal and others did to
catalyze tsca and 
a  issue is emc  impression of disturbing
congressional attitudes on a key  the banner of good laws and
regulations based on good science does not have the isipact on congress
that it once  some members of congress are claiming that this is
merely an excuse to delay implementation of  although the
government relations group is responsible for our congressional 
the emc bases its efforts on the underlying principle of good 
we must meet this challenge 
in addition to the federal  state issues will demand effort
from emc  with superfund and disposal sites being major 
national ambient air quality standards  revisited for 
superfund  be a continuing area of  some
important issues will be in  including litigation in which cma
may  many cleanups will be underway and some 
data will need to be compiled for future efforts to sunset the 
 assistance to state groups on state   tort 
with a substantially reduced  we must select our priorities

approved expansion of  state affairs  including the
addition to staff of two professionals and one support person at
an annualized cost of  this is to be accomplished within
the current budget reduced by  and within the presently

e
approved the recommendation of the communications committee that
the  ad program be postponed   fernandez then
put this decision in perspective by reviewing the history of the
communications  including  and advising that 
ommendations will be received from the communications committee
involving a significant reduction in print ad expenditures and a
change in emphasis in the print ad

 this fiscal year which would translate to a budget deficit
of about  when combined with the approval of an expanded
state affairs  the executive committee will receive 
mendations to  and reallocate expenditures to implement the
state affairs program and at the same time avoid the  a
larger budget deficit in fiscal  could occur if calendar year

be reduced to approximately  of the originally approved 
percent level to reflect the actual forecasted communications 
 it is planned that this will be the last special

determine fuel choices and to some  energy prlees and
 the energy committee also initiated some positive
steps toward energy regulatory 
cma energy committee attention is concentrated on the
following selected 
hatural cas issues
legislation to deregulate natural gas was introduced and cma
remains active in congressional hearings on this priority
 cma advocates total phased deregulation of all natural
gas wellhead celling prlees by a certain date and the
coordinated removal of gas market restrictions such as
incremental  fuel dee act prohihltlona and limited
access to gas 
cma was identified as a key player in the natural gas debste
when it sponsored a major study that compared and evaluated 
studies on natural gas  the analysis prepared by
foster associates indicated that the more comprehensive
studies agree with  view that substantial economic
benefits to the nation would result from phased total

august  
good  my energy committee report is a bit like a good  bad news
 the good news has already happened in the year just  the bad
news is waiting to happen in  and it may if we relax our efforts during
the current 
last year i optimistically titled ay report   anticipating that
we had reached a major turning point in federal energy  that ve could
correct the excesses of the past and in particular the overregulation of the
carter years and the five part national energy act of  that we could
move from supply regulation and demand restriction to supply stimulation
through free market  knowing that further gains in energy conservation
and fuel switching and most importantly market stability and predictability
would  that optimism was based on the election of ronald raagan with
his free market energy  it is useful to review two parts of the
energy plank of the  bepublican 
 order to increase domestic production of  republicans
 advocate the decontrol of the price at the wellhead of oil and
 also believe that market restrictions on the use of
natural gas should be 
  understand that a free market based on the
collective priorities and judgments of individual consumers will
efficiently allocate the energy supplies to their most highly valued

the president has delivered on many of his energy  the energy
committee likes to think that ve have helped over the past 
last year we identified two major items for our energy 
natural gas  and
elimination of inequitable federal allocation schemes for the
distribution of crude oil under the emergency preparedness allocation 
for emergency  we prepared recommendations and testified before
congress and lobbied for no bill to replace the expired  while these
efforts  convince congress that a bill was not  we believe
they did help to reinforce president  resolve that no bill was
 although congress passed the standby petroleum allocation  the
president vetoed that bill and in a remarkable turnaround the senate sustained
the veto after passing the spaa by a vote of  to 
i also reported significant reductions in the regulatory burden of the power
plant and industrial fuel use act and this year i can again report even
further  these regulations were one of those identified for vice
president  regulatory reform task 
cwa 

in march president reagan ended any chance of congressional action on the
deregulation of natural gas when he announced that he would not seek
legislation in  while consumer activists and other opponents of
deregulation hailed the  announcement as a major victory most
 recognized it as a postponement not a solution to the problems of
the natural gas policy act and the public debate has 
the energy committee recognized that the  particularly as reported by
the  was not going in  the exaggerated claims of the
consumer activists and other opponents of decontrol were consistently gaining
headlines while more rational analyses were being  the energy
committee commissioned foster  a nationally recognized natural gas
authority and  to compare and analyze ten recent studies of natural
gas deregulation that varied widely in their findings on the impact of
 as you would  the conclusions of each study supported the
views of the 
foster found two studies decidedly more comprehensive and realistic
assessments of total phased  these were by the department of energy
and standard oil of 
 foster found three studies predicted  and
unsupportable field price  and hence contributed little to a
constructive analysis of the decontrol  in march we held a press
conference to release the foster study and we followed that with a
congressional staff  both events were well  just last
month representative dannemeyer from california quoted from our study in the
current hearings before the house fossil and synthetic fuels 
in  our energy conservation resumed its upward progress by climbing to
  better than  this is particularly encouraging in light of
the stagnant  our voluntary goal of  appears well within 
it is also of interest to examine how our raw energy consumption has changed
since  this table reflects raw energy usage as reported hy our member
 it has not been corrected for production  significant
reductions have been made in fuel oil and natural gas 
surprisingly coal use is actually down slightly and electricity is up

 afraid
the answer is  this is the bad  last year we had two major
 this year we have 
natural gas decontrol 
emergency preparedness is in a state of  and
the newcomer  of  energy 
cma 
i
 goals and objectives
 examine our plans and goals for each of che major 
 natural gas 
the chemical industry consumes over two
trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually which is more than  of the
total united states consumption and about  of the  industrial 
 is our last chance for legislation to be enacted to replace the ngpa
before its partial decontrol occurs on january   the administration
and congress will be reluctant to address natural gas in  a presidential
election   our worst case risk is no longer just 
 it is an extended  our basic position on deregulation is that
che ngpa be amended to provide 
smooch and predictable phase up of all natural gas wellhead ceiling
prices to market clearing 
free market access for all   and distributors to all
types of natural gas 
a coordinated removal of supply and demand restraints including the
repeal of the industrial sections of the fuel use act and incremental

in order to make significant progress over the coming months in the
deregulation  we must address in detail four areas of 
 timing of  gas  the interstate 
distribution  and some predominantly interstate consumers are
reluctant to give up natural gas access and bidding advantages that they have
under the  many are willing to decontrol old  but not simultaneously
with new 
 the problem of   the interstate
pipelines are quite concerned about imprudent contracts that they have 
particularly after the ngpa was  that contain price escalator
 in theory these  upon  would increase the price of
gas paid by these pipelines beyond market clearing  the pipelines want
legislated protection to prevent this 
 a windfall profits  such a tax is a distinct political
possibility as a compromise to consumer activist interests and as a source of

arsenic
spac recommended approval of a new program on 
the primary
objective of the program is the education of people within regulatory
agencies through a jointly sponsored arsenic symposium with the national
bureau of  this symposium    will provide a
means for industry and government agencies to come to an understanding of
 regulation of arsenic as a hazardous material through
knowledge of production and use  toxicologic  and the
presence of arsenic in the 
ethylene oxide
the ethylene oxide industry council was formed to  develop information
regarding responsible industry programs to control exposure to ethylene

recommended that the  charter be amended to include epidemiologic
studies and possible evaluation of the environmental effects of 
phthalate esters
in early  the phthalate esters panel planned a material handling survey

the panel
was concerned that epa had taken regulatory action on preliminary
information and that epa might come up with an unreasonable tsca section
  spac recommended that the panel add advocacy to its charter and
that they establish a dialogue with epa on developing a  test

this was a valuable recommendation as can be seen by the
subsequent accomplishments of this panel   of the

expected to be minimal since the participating companies would provide all
technical expertise and management skills necessary to conduct the

the number of special programs administered by cma increased at a 
erate rate from  to  by the end of  cma was administering to
seventeen special  since  requests for cma to undertake new
special programs have increased  this increase is due mainly
to increased activities related to the toxic substances control  clean

committee on disc
cma enthusiastically applauds the decision of the reagan administration
to continue its support of the provisions of the internal revenue code which
pertain to domestic international sales corporations 
for some time the treasury department and the office of the special
trade representative had considered proposals to modify the disc 
this review stemmed from allegations of our major european trading partners
that those provisions violate the gatt subsidies 
it is understood that the gatt council may make a final decision in the
near future on whether disc violates  it is possible that such a decision
could be delayed for an  month  cma is most encouraged that the
administration will vigorously defend the disc   if it is
ultimately decided that disc violates  the united states will be faced
with repealing or replacing  or retaining disc and allowing gatt members
to impose countervailing duties and to take trade  this would 
ably result in gatt becoming a weakened international 
the disc issue is very important to the economics of the  chemical
 export sales comprise a significant portion of total industry 
and export profits are likewise  the elimination of the disc
provisions would substantially affect the ability of the  chemical industry
to compete in international   if disc were eliminated and
accumulated earnings were made subject to  chemical companies would see
a substantial plunge in available capital and earnings reported to shareholders
in that year because of payment of the tax or an increase in tax 
it is possible that disc could be replaced by a different export 
such as a foreign international sales  regardless of what is 
ongoing industry effort will be required to ensure that any disc replacement
is at least as beneficial as  the key questions that must be considered
in this regard are the treatment of existing tax deferrals and intercompany
pricing 
in view of these  the tax policy committee recommends that
cma take the following positions with respect to 
cma supports disc as the minimum response of the 
government to an effective export  cma and
cma 
member companies should urge secretary  ambassador
 and other representatives of the government not to
concede that oisc might violate  european countries
should be made to understand that the united states believes
that disc is not as strong an export incentive as the effect
of the tax systems of those countries and that the united
states is committed to and will provide an incentive no
less strong than 
cma   direct its tax policy committee to
  and pursue alternative export incentives
so that cma could respond imnediately with an acceptable
alternative to any action of  the  or the
congress that might lead to a likely repeal of

should pursue three fundamental   any
alternative export incentive shall be at least as beneficial
to exports on an overall basis as the present disc 
 any alternative export incentive must contain
clear and equitable principles for the pricing of exports
along the lines of section  of the disc  
there  be no tax imposed as part of any changeover

 more than  billion in current  corporate
income taxes may have been deferred by american industry

 services department
status report
the creation of this department was announced at the january
 board 
 it has been in existance
for only  
it is staffed by one professional and a

rationale for creating department
the chemical industry has been under critical pressure for
many years by  the media and  both
legislative and 
as the industry is widely spread across the  with some
 areas of heavy  these pressures also
have been widely   the pressures extended
to and were applied by national environmental  national
media and the federal 
cma had no formal mechanism at state and local levels to counter
the efforts directed against the 
one was needed  a broadly based one to strengthen  advocacy
effectiveness on the national  the need became even more
evident with the election of president reagan and his commitment
to 
this turning to the states by the federal government in no way
lessened the absolute necessity for strength in 
it
reaffirmed the  for now the industry was to face fighting
on  fronts   with much of which would take place
lighting the fuse on issues to explode  right up
to 
in the early  some state and local groups representing
the chemical industry in their respective areas were 
largely on their  cma   had an 
 love affair with these autonomous 
some  some  others were quite 
in the
 and early  when support was  cma  decid
what to 
 those that survived went their own 
the relationship with cma was not 
that was how matters stood in january 
 attached
    a brief look at state

cma 
departmental objective
build a  broadly based chemical industry state and local
structure to support cma at the point of the pyramid in
washington 
developing a  cooperative association with existing
 councils and chemical industry 
helping to found additional similar groups where

working in like manner with the corporate headquarters
of cma members  through  with their plants
in local 
studying the chemical  seeking to find
companies eligible for cma membership and recruit them
through the membership committee and the  while
working closely with the cma offices of secretary and

serving cma through eyes and ears attuned to problems
upon which the association should act 
acting as the catalyst to bring association resources
to bear on problems and assure that needed 
 policy positions and programs are fielded
where  principally with state 
action to date
top priority has been given to strengthening existing state
groups and our ties with 
this priority also included
helping in firming the establishment of four just coming on
stream when the department was 
the four brought to
 the number of   southern  has since
merged with the california chemical industry council to constitute
a blanket organization for the 
it   continue
as a satellite group as most of the plant operations are in the
 and there is need for it to continue to meet on concerns
peculiar to its 
 inside back cover of brochure for
list of 
the newest groups are in new   connecticut
and 
with member company  we are working on building
relationships with the chemical groups instituted under the
wings of the associated industries of kentucky and the virginia
manufacturers 
we also are actively exploring
the possibilites of assisting in the creation of units in north
 arkansas and 
cma 
to help us focus on critical  we conducted two 
both of which are 
the first was divided into two 
the initial section
covered the top  states as to value of 
all existing
state groups fell into this 
in conjunction with the
state activities division of the government relations 
we then selected those remaining states most likely to give
the industry problems and ranked them also as to value of

this came to  and none has a state chemical

other categories in the  and  were value 
number of chemical employees in  the percent of this
to all manufacturing employees in the  the percent of
chemical employees to total state  the number of
cma companies in the state and the number of their 
and the number of cma companies in the state with  million
or more in annual 
of the three states currently under study for new 
north carolina and iowa fall into the top 
kentucky and
 with whom we are working as noted  alsp
are in this 
 we either have existing or under
study organizations in  of the  those without are targets
and include  south    massachus 
maryland and 
arkansas falls into the set of  ranking
third in value of 
these studies have been distributed to cma staff for needs
as they see fit and either have or will be given to all state

the second  also  shows us the participation
by cma member companies in existing state  according
to their membership rosters supplied us by october  
as these groups accept members the year  it is possible
some cma member companies have joined or applied or are 
ing joining since receipt of 
the brunt of support is borne by  to  percent of our 
there are a number with spotty  some with 
these are targets of opportunity for broadening the 
outreach 
t
f
to consolidate our efforts to date and to further increase
mutually beneficial working  we scheduled the
first annual meeting of state groups on november  the day
following the semiannual 

i
as of this  all but one of the state groups will
participate and there is reason to believe attendance will
be

as
the program included the vice presidents for  
government relations and communications spelling out the services
available to state  an equal portion of the program
featured actions by state 
one section was devoted to
what they felt they need from us and how needs can be 
since the founding of the  i have  on their
home  every existing group at least 
i have
had two or more visits with a  speaking at executive
 semiannual and annual 
the 
what we are trying to do and the how and why of  the
 without  has been 
they feel
 needed and appreciate the outstretched  any
reluctance has largely been 
cooperation by all segments of cma staff has been 
when called  response has been thorough and  
there has been no reluctance to call upon member services for
assistance in reaching state groups when specific needs 
 many valuable suggestions have come from various

action forecast
all attending will be asked to critique the first
annual meeting so that the second can be 
more 
new state groups will be formed as  and if
 as quickly as conditions 
the promotion of joint meetings by state groups will
be 
the texas chemical council already
has invited the california chemical council to meet
jointly at its annual 
if this is  plans to continue such efforts with 
the possibility of two to three regional meetings
of state groups under cma sponsorship will be studied
and  if 
efforts will continue to help state groups build

 there will be time to institute a state

developments affecting
domestic international sales corporations 
cma has learned that the treasury department is considering
a modification of the domestic international sales corporation
 provisions of the internal revenue  this consideration
has arisen because of allegations by european common market members
that the disc provision violates the gatt subsidies 
under present  the disc provisions permit a corporation
to defer current  income taxation on up to  of its
export profits so long as those profits are devoted to export
related 
in  the latest year for which official
treasury department figures are  the chemical and
allied products industries deferred  million in taxes from
disc sales or  percent of total gross  at 
 is not only the value of the current tax incentive for
disc related  but the tax treatment of previously
deferred disc 
since the disc provisions were enacted in
 total tax deferrals could be substantial for many cma
member 
at the september   board of directors expressed
its concern over developments related to disc and directed the tax
adipates and  at that time the bureau of foods was
preparing a strategy document for submission to the fda 
sioner which could have resulted in a restriction or ban of deha
in food contact 
the phthalate esters fdatg met
with representatives of the fda and successfully delay d the
strategy  the fdatg is currently preparing a detailed
review of deha toxicity data and developing a voluntary testing
program which fda could accept in lieu of an interim regulation
or ban on  since the phthalate esters panel was originally
organized and funded to address   the fdatg

the special program advisory committee  was formed to
provide the program panels with  expertise in
areas of scientific research and governmental 
spac
reviews each special program on an  basis and once a year
reports to the cma executive committee on the progress f each

controversies which exist either within a panel or between
staff and panels which cannot be resolved at staff  are
brought to spac for review and  spac reviews all
new and revised programs for consistency with association

acrylonitrile 
the arerylonltrlle program is concerned with the
  and environmental aspects of processes
involving  its copolymers and its end 
the program was begun in  to develop additional data on the
toxicology of  this was accomplished through animal exposure
studies by inhalation and 
an epidemiology study was not conducted because of lack of
specific exposure data for most of the period to be studied as
well as difficulties associated wlch designating a suitable
control  several participating companies conducted their
own internal epidemiology  three of which have been

chlorobenzenes 
the chlorobenzenes program panel began its program in 
with the conduct of a worldwide literature search on available
health data regarding monochlorobenzene   robenzene  and  benzene 
since that
 the panel has been concerned with expanding the 
logical data base on these three compounds and has recently added
a fourth  to a proposed test 
in october  the panel initiated a series of teratology
studies on  odcb and pdcb in rats and  to clarify
results obtained in the mcb study in  a  study
was conducted in this  a draft final report on both mcb
studies is expected by the end of the  the odcb research was
completed and interim data are being  animals go on

cma 
the panel has worked closely vlch che chlorobenzenes
producers association  in formulating comments on 
proposed rules for testing of chlorobenzenes under tsca section
 the cpa has held a series of discussions with epa in an
effort to develop a voluntary  testing program
in lieu of a formal test  a proposal outline was developed
and submitted to the  if  the cpa has asked the
panel to provide funding and administration for the 
epoxy resin 
the special program on epoxy resins was approved in 
 the panel was formed to evaluate the available health

 ethylene oxide 
a study conducted at  labs showed ethylene oxide to
be carcinogenic in  industry was interested in gathering
information on the safe handling of ethylene oxide which led to
the formation of the ethylene oxide industry council on july 
 the council operates through an executive committee and

when president reagan made his public appeal last month on new
proposals to reach his overall budget  he rejected delays in
any of the recently enacted individual tax  
the president proposed to enact new measures to eliminate 
and obsolete incentives in the tax  these include proposals
to restrict or to repeal the use of tax exempt industrial revenue
 to accelerate the quarterly payment of corporate income
 to repeal business and individual energy tax  and to
liminate the practice of allowing certain contractors to defer income
tax payments until the last year of a

for additional user fees on   and private 
as  the proposed sources of new tax resources cited
by the administration met strong opposition on capitol  early
warning signals from senate finance committee chairman bob dole
 indicated that at present a majority of the senate would
prefer to postpone the effective date of the reagan individual tax
custs from july to  both in  and in  rather than
to adopt new taxes so near an election  on the other  the
house democratic leadership for the moment appears willing to allow
pressure from the economy to build before directly confronting the

natural gas
it is currently expected that when a formal administration

have been considered by the  general principles or 
lines for   may be provided to the congress in
order to promote a hearing process this  congressional 
sideration will also be influenced by the nearing of the

problems involved in implementing the natural gas policy act

 differs by not listing specific priority guideline 
but would require adoption of regulations consistent with the
priorities specified in the old 
the administration remains opposed to the passage of any

the chemical industry needs a comprehensive review
of the clean water act in 
these needs go far beyond a simple extension of
bat 
while we support an extension of the  bat 
we have a deep concern that the inclusion of such
an amendment now will preclude a comprehensive
