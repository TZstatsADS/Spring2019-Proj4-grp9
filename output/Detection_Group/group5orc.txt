my comments are dlrected to trade pollcy   thls mornlng  and what i belleve m be our   hopefully   they
will  hlth al  cma internatlonal trade commlttee

i wlsh my report thls mornlng had better 
 on trade matters   we contlnue to lose 
unfortunately 
our tctal  sales   to overseas markets   and produce
another is    as an    we are one of 
major   only agrlculture   and electronlc
 compare mm our      trade

in washlngton   both the executlve and leglslatlve branches of
government   have become mere   trade durlng the past
 but the resultlng patchwork qullt of initiatives  confused  nd    some    counterproductlve  tax 
same    to be sure   are  others  unfortunately   run the gamut from polltlcal posturlng   to
downrlght foollsh  we cannot assume that wlsdom   or
common sense   will carry the  just look at the democratlc tax
mu   as the latest example   of how badly our  has been

furthermore    the marketplace    seemg the emergence
of powerful new competltors   dlfferent competltors than we nlght
have envlsloned only a few years 
the gulf states  producers no longer hold world users on a
short  today they have abundant cheap    new lowcoast productlon capaclty   and plenty of lhcentlve   to sell a
lot of valuewadded petrochemlcals  our  that lhcentlve
grows dally as the price of that  barrel  we were all too
clearly remlnded of thls by saudl plannlng mlnlster hlsham nazlr at
 october 
if you follow trade statlstlcs   you know that the  has
had an  merchandlse trade deficit since  in   and thls  rough because all the numbers  been totted up   looks as  tha trade deficit will be over    up at
cm 

least  from   as recently as    we had a
manufacturlng trade surplus of 
notwlthstandlng thls natlonal dlsaster   our chemlcal 
 achleved a statlstlcal trade surplus   estlmated to be  for  although we seem to be holdlng our own  chemlcal
exports   an estlmated      chemlcal 
have been  rapldly   by about  per year since 
they reached a record  last year   and the  share
of world trade   decllned for the  stralght 
in other words   our  trade surplus has dropped by
almost 
myron foveaux recently gave his annual publlc trade
prognostlcatlon for   numbers are based on the forecasts
  that he obtalns from about  of our chemlcal  he
forecasts our exports will be flat     desplte the weakenlng
of the dollar   and that  will be up about  percent  to about   that will result  another  percent
decllne  our trade surplus for the year   to about  
 share of our markets at home   to forelgnibased

lest we draw consolatlon from the fact that we have any trade
surplus at all    dlssect   a trade surplus  means that the sales of our exports   exceed the sales of unported
chemlcals sold  the  as you know   sales alone  mean
much  your pockets are empty at the end of the tradlng 
i belleve our trade plcture    slot gloomler than our
projected  bllllon surplus  if we had a way to
calculate a trade profltablllty balance   the net effect of
chemlcal exports versus unports   on our aggregate bottom llne  would   be a  i doubt 
 the export slde of the ledger   i suspect a lot of
companles are exportlng near costs   to preserve or bulld 
conslder the comment by me presldent george kennedy   in the new
york tlmes last january    malntalned   or  some cases
of our profltablllty    another   had to cut them

 unport flgure   should cause our  to get cur
antenna 
are we  bemg outgunned  our home markets by better
products and productlvlty  or   are we the vlctlm of overt
and covert subsldles   the largesse of our own asp system   our
open markets   and the adverse effect of an overvalued 
trade should be a twoiway street   but  many initiatives   both
trafflc lanes seem to be comlng our 
each of our companles are unpasted by forelgn competltlon

the ferc subsequently modlfled the rule so that pipelines must permlt
dlstrlbutlon company customers to reduce thelr exlstlng sales demand by up
to  per year over elva 
the modlfled rule  order  also
permltted certaln transportatlon programs to contlnue untll february 
thus  most pipelines have been unwllllng to transport gas under
the new 
the justlce department  investigating complalnts that
pipelines have colluded  refuslng to carry gas under those 
ferc proposed rules on natural gas

consumers urged the ferc not to unplement a proposed block bllllng

on december   cma
testlfled before the ferc and presented results of an economlc unpact
study on the proposed block  
cm  the cost of the rule
to amerlcan  would be  bllllon per  and the annual cost
to the chemlcal  alone would be approxlmately  
both the chemlcal  and    rely
substantlally on gas purchased dlrectly from

chemlcal  purchases  of  natural gas from sources other than
conventlonal pipeline system 
the  done for cma by foster
 predlcts the proposed pricing rule would ralse the price of
gas belng purchased dlrectly from 
  users
buylng  gas could be allocated hlgher gas 
the ferc proposal also restrlcts pipeline sales of lowicost gas to
exlstlng 
 hill  pressure on both local
dlstrlbutlon companles  and endiusers to purchase gas dlrectly from
 leadlng to a shlft away from conventlonal pipeline system

the proposed rule nulllfles the potentlal advantages of 
competltlon through the expedlted certlflcate 
 reduces
  and encourages bypass of tradltlonal
pipeline system supply 
the study also  the ferc proposal would  spot 
threat  and tradltlonal pipeline
