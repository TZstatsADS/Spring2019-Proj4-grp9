particular reference  but not limited  washington and government
 a preliminary report was made to the executive committee
and to the board in  and several suggestions were 
the committee feels that this report represents only a first step
towards strengthening mca and that the effectiveness of mca ought to be
reviewed annually by the executive committee and the 
discussions with a cross section of board  mca 
and member company personnel serving on mca committees and on the
washington scene pointed to a central need and opportunity to improve
 the committee believes  communications can be
improved in a number of areas by eliminating  sharpening 
 focusing efforts on key  and coordinating the activities of
various parts of the

 the agenda for board meetings should be revamped to include
additional reports from chairmen of technical and functional 
a regular review of legislative activity by the director of government

financial impact should be decided upon prior to  when development
of the budget  the executive committee should also formulate a list
of the most critical issues facing the industry and indicate those issues for
which mca positions should be 
a letter should be sent from the chairman of the board to all
executive contacts following the june  greenbrier meeting outlining the
newly adopted approaches and procedures for the  mca  and
soliciting their active interest and

a negative public  it is most   and i welcome this 
portunity to review for you the   plans and  structured
to meet our assignment and responsibility to the mca under conditions so changed from
the 
committee evolution
the committee was first established in the mid   as you will  there
was a shortage of graduate  the initial objective was to encourage students
i pursue a career in  so as to assure an adequate supply of chemists for the
xpanding needs of our 
until the mid  the committee continued to follow a program of recruiting students
into  but then some red flags went  when careful reviews of technical
graduate  studies lad several of our members to predict that the high post
world war ii birth rates would result in an oversupply of chemists in the early  the
rough coincidence of this graduate oversupply  with the economic downturn of the
chemical industry beginning in  and the layoffs of employed chemists and chemical
engineers which  accelerated the rate at which the oversupply of unemployed
ch  persons was  as of earlier this   of all chemists 
years of age or less were  faced with these unsettling aspects in the job
 the committee decided to modify its  instead of stressing 
we began to focus on the quality and type of training suitable for chemists going into

future technical manpower  relationship
in looking  we are confronted with a highly confused picture concerning the
future  relationship for new graduate scientific and engineering 
 major  studies reaching into the  by such prestigious groups
as the national science  scientific manpower  engineering
manpower commission of the joint engineers council and the   department of
labor reach varying  ranging from prediction of years of oversupply to dire
warnings of impending 
perhaps this is to be expected as the nation grapples with the problem of changing
priorities and shifting  and in view of  it would appear that the use of
historical trend data for predicting technical manpower supplies ten years from now forces
some degree of uncertainty into the  but the weight of the evidence seems to
lie on the side of an impending  the   on the other 
as mode by similarly competent  are considered to be much more  we
can discuss these figures with more  in  such studies predict we
will experience a sharp downward trend in   and  degrees awarded in
chemistry and all engineering during the next four 
if this downward trend  there is reason to believe that a shortage of some
proportions could develop in the supply of scientific and engineering  as
responsible members of the chemical  i believe there is cause for us to be
 concerned over both the short and long range  i will not burden you with a
complete statistical analysis that supports this  but here are some significant

 undergraduate enrollments for majors in chemistry have historically increased
modestly each  in   the number of   degrees awarded in
chemistry declined for the first time in   we conclude that a high  
rate between entry and graduation for chemistry majors has taken 
 the number of first year graduate students in  chemistry programs has
declined  since  statistics for each year indicate an increased number of
students who earn a degree in chemistry only as a   to careers in other

 undergraduate enrollments and earned degrees in engineering are declining
 from the total engineering bachelor supply of  graduating in
 the output in  is expected to fall to 
against this background of  interest in scientific and engineering
 there are some that claim that even larger decreases in the employed technical
woricforce may be  as an adjustment to changing r  d  if this 
comes nee  i susp ct w will find the students moving ever farther away from the
chemical  a developm nt we would all like to avoid if 
cma 
the chemical  as you well  is an industry of great 
requiring many high level intellects to effectively  manage and operate
the  our future ability to attract such individuals in the numbers required
will depend largely on the prestige of the  working conditions and personal
opportunities for 
in attempting to assess future requirements for new graduate chemists and chemical
 we make the prediction this number will remain a reasonably stable percentage
f the total industrial  at the risk of  we have reached this
conclusion by assuming two important opposing demand trends will tend to balance each
 the downward trend involved  during the past    activities
accounted for a large fraction of total technical  with this fraction tending
to become  as  is  one can logically reason future needs for
chemists and chemical engineers in this area will  on the other  an
upward trend involving  problem  such as environmental control
and the impending energy  which heretofore have not been factors of any 
cance as users or chemically trained  could possibly impose heavy future 
mands against  offsetting losses in the  sector of the chemical  
 we believe continued reductions in chemistry and engineering majors and
earned degrees will likely leadto shortages of technical graduate manpower 
in view of the uncertainty surrounding future  it is tempting to adopt a  and
  the committee counsels against  because to do so will undermine
the attractiveness of chemistry and the chemical industry as a oareer choice for 
  it will likely intensify the negative image many students and young 
specially in   have for the chemical and other 
 and above  we must bear in mind that the manpower problems we anticipate
in four or eight years  in   problems because the new chemists and engineers
 we will hire then are in the educational pipeline 
restoration of confidence in industry
if you agree with me that there has indeed been a loss of confidence by the student body
in our  the question then arises as to what steps we can take to restore  we
of the committee feel this is a serious matter that should be promptly dealt with in some
positive  in conjunction with the public relations  we are organizing an
effort to define a program for your   i urge you to  with
 serious consideration to this matter so that the mca and the industry can have an
important continuing influence on the educational system and on national manpower

professional societies and companies abandoned this activity in view of changed

give greater emphasis to the variety of tasks performed in the chemical  there
is a continuing need for people with a chemical background  as you  the 
plication of their education and training might not conform to the traditional and
academic image of the chemist or chemical  the subcommittee encourages
those with particular ability and interest in chemistry to a career in r

through our education  on three occasions we combined the consumer inf rmation and education exhibits to stretch our exhibit dollars and to reach new audiences

 we published a manual of simple chemical demonstrations suitable for the general
public and have another manual of simple food experiments in the rough manuscript 
 education exhibit provides us the opportunity to present all our programs and
