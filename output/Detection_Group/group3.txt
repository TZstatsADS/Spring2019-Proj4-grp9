brought by 
more recently mca joined the american 
leum institute and the american iron and steel institute in
successfully challenging  benzene regulations in the
fifth circuit court of 
mca also has asked for a
review of  pretreatment regulations adopted under

 legal advocacy presently covers a broad range of 
ministrative and regulatory activity including  proposed
generic cancer   proposed medical records

president carter has named douglas   administrator of
the environmental protection  to chair the newly created 
inflation  
the council will be comprised of
representatives of the departments of   
 education and  housing and urban  
  treasury and 
the role of the council
is to coordinate federal rulemaking to ensure more efficient and
 
a staff of  people will be drawn
from the federal agencies 
the  first assignment
is the development of a unified calendar of major federal 
to be published in the federal register by february  
the regulatory council will complement activities already 
quired by executive order  on regulatory 
these would
include the work of the regulatory analysis review group 
which is chaired by the council of economic advisors with staff
support from the council on wage and price 

the rarg has authority to review only  major regulations per year
with a maximum of four regulations per federal 
cma 

the initial proposals for the regulatory council would probably
have increased the influence of the council of economic 
and the council on wage and price stability to put a cap on costs
of regulations
 strong pressure from  
mental groups and labor caused the president to abandon the economic
advisors  dominated regulatory  and adopt the current
structure which is similar to the one proposed by agency chiefs as an
alternative
under the present organizational  the office of
management and budget  and the council on wage and price stability

attention to chemical incidents continues
j
a wide range of governmental and legal actions confront our
industry because chemicals may be dangerous when  overused
or mishandled and because incidents resulting from such abuses
greatly concern the 
media attention and public  in  are intense and
 and show no signs of abating
this is in spite of the fact
that the chemical industry as a whole has had an excellent record
in handling hazardous chemicals on a daily basis without harm to
the public or the environment
i
i
governmental and congressional attention is just as  and
official bodies have proposed many solutions to problems arising from
chemical 
they have done   in a piecemeal and
uncoordinated manner
in their various  these solutions call for the transfer
of resources to provide the 
 penalties for 
 restitution for individuals personally or economically 
 remedies or neutralization of the effects of chemical
 and
 restoration of damaged sites and 
the adjournment of the  congress on october  has not
halted attempts by the legislative and executive branches to devise
remedies for incidents related to  misuse or improper 
posal of 
 the house commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations
held one day of hearings on october 
the subjects were 
tion problems occuring in hard man   where velsicol
chemical corporation disposed of chemical wastes at a

a second hearing is tentatively scheduled for

 with particular emphasis on inactive or abandoned hazardous
waste disposal sites

the first would provide relief to all 
sons injured as a result of toxic pollutants in the

veloped in the  congress  first for oil and then chemical
spills  will reappear in new legislative initiatives where

 all indications suggest that the new congress will return
to formation of public policy regarding liability for chemical
incidents early in  staff preparation is already 
both the house and the senate have pledged early action on rcra and
it is anticipated that amendments will be enacted in

possible that liability and compensation provisions will be included
in amendments to rcra and that they may either  or set

important tax legislation enacted
three pieces of tax legislation were enacted in the closing
days of the  congress which are of interest to the chemical

revenue act of  most important of these is the revenue
act of  passed by congress on october  and signed by the
president on november 
following are major provisions of this
measure affecting 
 corporate income tax rate  the maximum corporate income
tax rate will be reduced from  to  effective 
cma 

 investment tax credit  the  investment tax credit and
the  used property limitation have been made 
the amount of tax liability that may be offset by the credit will

taxes by an estimated  billion in 
 capital gains  effective october   for

 business entertainment  deductions will be denied after

foreign earned income act of  for taxable years beginning

taxpayers living in certain hardship locations would be allowed
a special  deduction in order to fully compensate them and to

oil pricing continues

act  as amended by the energy policy and conservation act of

regulation of the pricing and allocation of crude  residual
fuel  and each refined petroleum 
 current 
under these laws the president is required
to regulate the price of oil until may  
his authority to
alter the present oil pricing regulatory scheme prior to that date is
subject to congressional  and thus a possible veto by either
house of

to allow the average domestic price of oil to rise ten percent

employ this authority

price of oil expires
after that date the president has discretionary
authority to promulgate and amend pricing regulations or issue other

aggressive leadership and his willingness to compromise with the
opposition
it appears that only republican whip robert michel 
could be a real threat to  but the two are close  and
michel is thought unlikely to mount a challenge
michel is next in
line to succeed retired elford cederberg  as ranking minority
member on the house appropriations  but republicans have
traditionally foreclosed a member from holding leadership and ranking
committee posts simultaneously
 next behind michel in
seniority on the appropriations committee is silvio conte  
garded as a   and too liberal by many 

 there is talk that rhodes could placate the conservatives
and finesse a challenge to his minority leadership position by backing
a waiver allowing michel to be both whip and top republican on

 a relative moderate and former federal
 respected by committee colleagues and the house 
would be the next choice
but he has family connections and investments in the pharmaceutical industry which could cause an apparent
conflict in the  work on drug regulation and fda

bob eckhardt  is favored in the contest for the chair of
the  oversight and investigations 
if
he  eckhardt will have to give up his chairmanship of the
consumer protection  which will open up this 
  jurisdiction over the toxic substances
