solid wastes management committee
april  
the primary solid wastes management committee  concern
is for legislative proposals for   waste

for the last several years the swmc reports have
indicated legislative activity during the previous year and the
expectation of restrictive legislation the following  
though i am pleased to say that these forebodings have not come
to  i quickly note that the current situation is quite
similar to that of past years  legislation may well be passed
during this  
the first significant act dealing
with solid waste was passed in  and the second legislative
action followed in 
during  there was legislative
activity in this area  assuming five years to be a reasonable
gestation   could be the 
this legislation will
not be as far reaching as that being proposed for toxic 
but it will significantly impact chemical process industry 

since the last swmc report to the  there have been
nine major legislative  either actual bills or working
 concerning solid 
of these the senate public works
committee bill   sponsored by senator jennings randolph
and the house interstate and foreign commerce  
committee on transportation and commerce working draft as sponsored
by congressman  are the two most likely candidates for

the administration has not sponsored a bill but has
indicated general support of   we expect that each
proposal will reach its respective floor in 
although with some undesirable  senator 
bill is certainly the more acceptable of the two 
both
documents contain    but   is much
less complicated and it does not require federal approval for all
permits for waste  treatment and  but rather
concentrates on state implementation of a permit system similar
to current air and water 
the rooney proposal
requires permits at both 
in addition it addresses several
cma 

i
i
i
areas not included in   such as product and container control
as a means of source waste reduction and tax incentives for  we believe that the rooney working draft will be modified
to resemble the senate public works 
whatever the final form of the  mca will strongly
espouse the concept of performance requirements for waste disposal
rather than the predetermination or specification approach currently
being  waste should be deemed hazardous only after its
 quantity and disposal site have been carefully 
predetermination of a waste disposal method without investigating
each of these parameters is counterproductive because this restricts
development of new technology and precludes the use of viable
alternatives appropriate to specific geographical areas or to
available  mca will contend that the authority over
the areas of  transportation and storage of waste
materials continue to be vested in the  department of 

should adoption of a permit system be 
we will advocate that the disposal site rather than the generator
be the permittee and that state implementation of the permit
system under federal guidelines is preferred over direct federal

 to provide for reasonable regulatory
requirements from both a technical and economic  we
will strive for sufficient time constraints and flexibility in
any legislation to accommodate the dearth of technology and disposal cost data currently available to 
many of the  most notably texas and  have
 passed solid waste management legislation dealing with hazardous

because this legislation has preceded federal hazardous
waste disposal  it is quite likely that the epa may
adopt those concepts fostered by these states which have proven
to be most 
swmc monitors  states for
concepts which might be incorporated into federal 
in addition liaison is being maintained with the national solid
waste management association  to monitor its efforts to
develop a legislative guide for use by each 
ai

swmc legislative activity is directed almost solely to
disposal of hazardous 
chemical packaging has not been
raised as an issue to 
should this  swmc will ask the
chemical packaging  assistance on this matter which
is of vital importance to the cpi from a marketing as well as
disposal 
tl
cma 
a secondary but very important swmc concern is meaningful
liaison with the 
solid waste control is unique among 
mental concerns because the epa has had a relatively long lead
time to perform research and gather data to establish regulations
on a more scientific basis while still complying with the stringent
time frame expected in the enabling 
swmc feels it  especially in view of  
to present mca positions at every 
during the past
year there have been three salient examples of swmc work with 
 during our may     office
of solid waste management programs  representatives
made a presentation on an epa  million landfill project
being conducted with the state of 
this project
is intended to determine the effectiveness of modern 
fill design and operational 
several member
companies are following this work 
 on
december   at one of four epa public meetings on
hazardous  the chairman of swmc presented comprehensive
testimony on behalf of mca in response to a formal epa
request for such 
the epa is now developing
synopses of the various comments as a basis for its position
on legislation and on subsequent 
 a
meeting was held with personnel from the  solid and
hazardous waste research  municipal environmental
research laboratory in  ohio in conjunction with
a regular swmc 
swmc members have repeatedly
expressed a desire to investigate the possibilities of
contracting research work to fill existing data gaps in the
area of landfill disposal of potentially hazardous 
to avoid duplication it is important that we ascertain the
scope of epa research  the epa presentation and
suggestions were well received and very beneficial in
guiding us toward an appropriate research  to be
identified by our technical 
a compendium of  successful case histories of waste
recycling or residua disposal is being developed by the technical
 this document will provide positive cpi input to
various legislative and regulatory proposals with respect to the
significant amount of current work within industry on disposal of
potentially hazardous 
a joint  composed of representatives of the
swmc and water resources  was formed in  to develop
guidelines for

the concept of land use regulation continues to disturb
swmc members and representatives of the other environmental

land use legislation could be the most insidious
tool available to those who would punitively regulate the 
forms of land use regulation are currently embodied in federal
 water and coastal zone management  and several
land use proposals have been made relative to solid waste 
 as a result of the total  implications of
this issue the task group on land  consisting of two 
sentatives from each of the three environmental  was
established at the  
the group is to review the
question of land use with respect to possible implications on
cpi operations and to make appropriate recommendations to the
mca board for 
during its organizational meeting the
group concluded  prior to developing recommendations for
mca board  there is a definite need to ascertain current
cpi status with respect to all existing federal and regional
land use 
because of the legal nature of the 
mca staff through the joint subcommittee on environmental law
 or other legal source has been formally requested to
develop this information for the task group by july  
the task group will then develop its recommendations to mca
by  
the question of jsel  under review by the
legal advisory committee for some  has reportedly been
resolved in that jsel will remain intact and function in a
manner yet to be  we have been assured by mca staff
that legal assistance will be available upon 
at
present at least two formal requests have been made to jsel by
swmc seeking legal 
these include upcoming proposals
on solid waste legislation and the land use 
in order to
properly address these important issues it is imperative that
legal as well as technical expertise be readily 
to
 in keeping with past jsel  we have not received
indication that consideration of our requests has been 
if we are to effectively influence and combat unacceptable 
lative  adequate legal assistance is a 
with the exception of the jsel  some progress has
been made in improving internal mca communications and 
tional difficulties which were highlighted in the previous
two swmc  as per recommendations of the ad hoc committee
on environmental  two meetings have been held between
environmental committee chairmen and various mca staff to discuss
mca administrative procedures and methods by which mca can act
in a more unified and timely 
as a result of these
meetings several measures have been recommended to foster

one of these provides for government relations
department input into environmental committee meetings on a
continuing 
a member of the government relations staff
has been assigned to work with swmc in liaison 
this
in addition to the consistent and competent efforts of our
current staff secretary should be beneficial to swmc 
to insure that a continuing dialogue is maintained among
all facets of mca environmental  i recommend that a
meeting of environmental committee members and appropriate mca
staff be held annually to provide a forum for exchange and
coordination of information from all relevant  review
of mca administration procedures and resolution of issues
involving more than one of the environmental 
in  swmc is concerned with the ultimate disposal
of potentially hazardous 
of all the areas of 
mental  ultimate disposal most readily reflects the need
for a total environmental control  we may see 
nificant successes in air and water pollution abatement 
but what has the cpi really accomplished if these successes are 
negated because we are unable to dispose of the abatement process
residues or other potentially hazardous wastes in a technically
and economically feasible  we believe  if the 
governmental and technical expertise which should be available
to us through mca auspices can be combined into timely

it is a pleasure to be here today to report on the air quality

as being successful in meeting our

in clean air legislation served to restrain the fervor of the epa in
enforcing  deadlines of the clean alp  did a few court

substantial and inevitable confrontation with industrial growth and

polations of these  so i  belabor the

the agency

has found that regulation of such emissions as sulfuric acid mist using 
section iii requires far leas substantiation than a new ambient air

 epa prefers the equipment efficiency
 practicable  if you  this section

we believe our  careful scrutiny of these 
 and the propensity of individual company members to litigate
the issues they  have served to reduce the rate of 
tion of such 
we expect to continue following agency action
from inception to promulgation on the multitude of materials 
in this  we believe mca member  
nies will profit by both technical input and  communication

major impact of this shift in epa policy is being felt by our

thrust upon them by  infamous region

will reward their patience as

turning to another  of committee  to which
the board responded to a concern expressed by all environmental

offered by   committee in resolving mca staff and

difficult to 
the air quality committee could be more

comes 
i will close my oral remarks by looking ahead to future endeavors
 a few 
i see the air quality  attention phasing
from the old  and  control aspect into the more exotic

this will require a  much more 
ticated data  and perhaps more health oriented personnel to make
meaningful contributions to association

a  necessity to do much more extensive image

senate committee working on tax legislation
the senate finance committee began markup of tax 
reduction legislation on april  and is expected to report some
type of tax measure by  although it is not clear just
what the scope of the  action will  it is entirely 
possible that their bill will simply extend tax reduction 
visions which expire on june  thus delaying action on a tax
reform package until later in the  senator russell 
chairman of the finance  has indicated that such a
course is a distinct 
during the past two weeks of markup sessions the senate
committee dealt primarily with tax shelters of little direct
interest to the chemical 
it is significant to 
 that most decisions could be characterized as easing
off on limitations or restrictions included in the 
tax reform bill   many observers are concluding
therefore that when the conmictee takes up capital formation
and foreign income  its actions will be generally
more favorable to industry than chat of the 
 there is still danger  whenever a tax bill
comes up for senate floor action  be it a simple extension of
expiring tax reduction provisions or a comprehensive tax 
tax reduction package  senator kennedy and several other reformminded senators are expected to introduce a number of 
 these are likely to include proposals to repeal 
ferral of taxation of income of foreign  restrict
the use of the foreign tax  eliminate disc  repeal
the asset depreciation range   and repeal the 
tage depletion allowance for hard 
cma 
the fate of these extreme amendments will depend on the
ability of the business community to convince a majority of
senators of the damaging impact of the proposals on  
business and the general 
this was emphasized yesterday by   senator herman 
talmadge of   democrat on the senate
finance 
in addressing  chemical forum he urged
company officials to communicate their views on tax changes to
all  and especially to those on the finance 
in order to stimulate savings and capital  senator
talmadge indicated that he favored proposals recommended by the
administration and supported by mca to make the  investment
tax credit  to reduce the corporate tax  eliminate
double taxation of corporate profits and to modify the present
method of taxing capital  he fully supports retention of
the foreign tax credit and disc and firmly opposes any changes
that would materially alter and burden the competitive position
of our companies operating 
it is his opinion that many
members of the finance committee shared his views on these 
various business organizations are urging industry spokesmen
to contact all senators with whom they have constituent relations
to make known their views on these  we certainly support
this line of  and believe that such contacts should be
made before june 
clean air amendments hit snag in senate
the public works committees of both the house and senate have
reported bills in what is the first attempt at comprehensive 
vision of the clean air act of   
an emotional struggle is under way over provisions contained
in both bills intended to protect clean air against 

both bills establish certain  class i
areas where only small amounts of additional pollution would be
 the committees say their  proposals
would give states more control over the classification process
than do the  present 
industry views this approach
as thinly disguised federal  
cma 

in the  there are signs that support is growing for an
amendment proposed by senator frank moss  
the democratic
leadership has recently postponed until early june the floor 
bate on senator   s

the moss amendment would
defer the new nondeterioration restrictions for one  during
that  a national commission on air  established in
the senate  studies the economic and energy impacts of the
proposal and considers whether the government has enough technical
information to implement it
by late  senator moss had gathered    republicans and six  the hasty decision to postpone
floor action is being interpreted as an indication that his 
posal now has the backing to be  and that opponents need
more time to solidify their  mca is therefore 
tinuing to work to build support for the moss  we are
urging that member companies communicate with senators on this
subject as soon as 
the house interstate

the house might await the

proposed solid waste utilization legislation for may  and

december which was considerably more comprehensive than the

abandoned the first draft because of adverse  and that
another draft will emerge in  which will be less 
versial and more likely to attract wide  the subcommittee

gary   chairman
 and cosmetic chemicals committee
may 

it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to report to you
on the activities of the fdcc committee and to share with you
thoughts that have grown out of my association with the work of
the committee during the past 
as you  the objectives and the function of the fdcc
committee are as 
 advise thp board of directors concerning
chemicals used in   and  and in
accord with association policies and 
develop positions on legislation and regulations 
ing such  formulate principles and encourage
technical development pertinent to their use and
cooperate with other organizations having parallel
interests
considering the rapid rate of developments in the past few
 these responsibilities represent no small 
the activities
of the committee during the past year have been directed largely
toward consolidating and implementing organizational improvements
initiated during the preceding 
the organizational structure
that has been established consists essentially of a legislative and
regulatory  a scientific  and a 
ications  which are designed to closely follow 
ments in their respective 
the  through their
respective  and the steering  function by
developing and referring  reports and proposals to
the full committee for review and 
this structural concept
takes advantage of the available manpower by establishing a welldefined division of the work  eliminating repetitious 
and concentrating on developing concrete proposals for the basis
of committee 
task force units with specific areas of 
ment within these broad lines of division have also been used to

cma 
during the past  for  the committee prepared
and submitted extensive comments on the fda proposed administrative
practices and procedures 
of particular importance to
mca was the fda position stated in section   of these proposed
 that any representation made by a trade association
 be on behalf of its members and shall constitute a 
tation on behalf of each member of the trade  except
those specifically excluded by name in any such 
the
obstacles to equitable administration of justice under the law
that could be evoked by such a provision are so numerous as to preclude
detailed reference in this 
such objections have been fully
documented in our submission to 
other features of the proposed
regulations to which we have submitted substantial comments have
included a proposed limitation on the opportunity to present oral
testimony and to  witnesses during  and the
establishment of criteria which the fda asserted constituted a
proper basis on which to deny a petition or right to a 
these provisions and others of varying degrees of importance and
impact are not merely a codification of existing fda  but
in many  represent a basic change in practices that 
the rights of individuals subject to the  jurisdiction to
obtain consideration and 
another legislative development of importance which is now
under review by the legislative and regulatory subcommittee is the
kennedy food surveillance bill 
although originally heralded
as applying primarily to food manufacturing and processing 
 this proposed legislation has implications extending beyond
these 
under the manufacturing  surveillance features
are included relating to the establishment of safety assurance 
cedures within  product  record  and 
in addition the bill contains provisions for requiring registration
of food 
 in a broader  the bill
imposes obligations on food processors to immediately notify the
institution of a recall as well as the possibility that processed
foods  be 
citizens civil actions also are authorrized under the 
 the bill contains extensive
new requirements pertaining to the label identification of all

in addition to these  the committee has also
monitored the nci carcinogenic bioassay  the fcc and 
monographs for food  and the fda review of gras 
cma 
these activities have been carried out primarily under the program
of the scientific subcommittee together with a number of other
projects relating to technical developments in the area of 
 and cosmetic 
the development of proposed good
manufacturing practices guidelines for bulk drugs and food chemicals
is presently under study by this 
in  technical
liaison is carried out with the activities of  as they relate
to bulk drugs and with  as they relate to food 
a project presently active within the communications 
committee is the development of a proposal for the formation of a
chemical industry information 
although the details of the
organization and operation of such a center and various considerations
relating to its establishment are not yet defined in concrete 
it is believed that such a center could help to improve the 
understanding of questions and controversies that confront our

while the above describe briefly the broad spectrum of 
ties that have been carried forward during the past  a summary
of the  activities would not be complete without an
appropriate evaluation of this work as it relates to the objectives of the  responsibilities to 
such objectives clearly
must be understood in the light of the legislative and regulatory
climate that exists 
seen in this  one can only
feel a keen sense of inadequacy  of constantly striving to barely
keep up with developments and the frustration of being able only to
superficially react to the various problems that continue to 
despite the diligent efforts of restructuring the fdcc
 it is believed that a more fundamental reevaluation of
the mca activity in this area should be 
 a variety of ways in which response to the greater burden
in this area of our activities can be 
i would not propose as
part of this brief report to attempt to define in detail any 
ular 
it is   to recognize that the
time may have arrived whep the means which have served us well in
the past are no longer adequate to serve  needs in the
area of   and cosmetic 
mca has always prided itself on the fact that committee 
ship and most of the working input comes from the member 
i suggest that this policy may no longer be appropriate in areas of
cma 
fli
proliferating legislation and  such as  drug and
cosmetic 
these regulations are targeted at many 
frequently beyond the scope of interest of any single member 
 i urge this board to appoint a committee to study the
issue of from where should the leadership of any particular committee

should it be from the mca  or should it continue to
come from the member

in september  i had the privilege of speaking to the
board of directors to report on the industrial relations advisory
 
at that  i took a few minutes to

as to job  we shall see in the next three to five
years a definite major breakthrough in this  which will spill

negotiation to watch in this regard is that between the basic steel
industry and the united steelworkers of

issues will be submitted to arbitration under the experimental

will become a part of our industrial life here in the united

form as we are experiencing in 
two other areas which will stand out for increased future
activity are occupational safety and health and equal employment

whether you have unions or  your employees are
becoming more aware of their rights in these 
if you have
 many are building technical staffs in the

our work 
several companies in our industry have experienced
employee health crises in the last  with the resulting employee

management time and resources to avoid further employee anxieties
about the safety of their work 
as for osha  
 who now heads  has attempted to bring a balance to the
 stressing education rather than only

under the best of  those of us with unions can
i
expect to hear more about health and safety in future 
unions are impatient with

atomic workers  is suing 
we should expect that this impatience
will result in a more direct approach with  including
demands for safety committees with  use of union safety
consultants in our  and higher visibility for such 
oriented medical consultants as  irving  who has
recently been featured at union  including those of
the ocaw and the international chemical workers 
the equal employment field is another  
 most union leadership stayed far afield of 
equal employment  and 
most of their
membership was white and male and  advocate or want much

 as our efforts to better utilize minorities and
females have been  these same unions are now

private equal employment 
union leadership will push to
become more involved in our equal employment opportunity 
partly out of a new interest and partly to protect themselves from
discrimination charges from their new female and minority

this will continue to burden us with  and expensive
investigations and

there are signs that a number of carter appointments may be
revealed relatively  so that incoming officials will have maximum
time for planning and coordination with departing officials of the

observers around the world will be carefully

surely an effort to hold out the olive branch and to begin to build
support for key

 touching on matters relating to the strength of the economy

some observers   that the new president may
encounter considerable difficulty with the  despite the
fact that both ends of pennsylvania avenue are now firmly in
democratic  they reason it this  congressional leaders
and committee  while criticizing the  
of presidents nixon and  have obviously enjoyed the 
dence and status which the years of confrontation have 
they
have had an important role in punishing one president and in making
his successor appear  and are therefore likely to covet
their independence of 
 bills and programs delayed
by attention to watergate or stalled by ford vetoes are already in
fairly polished  and are not likely to be dropped readily by
their sponsors in favor of carter 
yet another factor
will be the attitude of the white house  and  carter

toward the georgia legislature during his term as

much of official washington is now speculating on the future
sections of policy and programs in the carter 
 from speeches and statements by the  and
from the democratic party platform itself it is possible to reach
some preliminary 
with respect to the  governor carter appears firmly in
favor of creating more jobs and providing stimulus to the national
 the prospect of a  tax cut is being seriously
 the formation of a national youth corp to hire and train
young people from urban areas is another carter  and is consistent
with bis support for direct job creation with emphasis on public
service  he also favors moderate interest  continued
support of investment  strong  enforcement and a
strengthening of the council on wage and price 
tax 
though a popular topic at the campaign  will take considerably
longer to 
the environment will receive high priority in the carter  the incoming president has opposed extending the compliance
feadlines for automobile exhaust emissions and would apparently retain
the present  concepts of the clean air 
he has
 for strict enforcement of water pollution control laws and
evidently will oppose efforts to weaken the federal water pollution
control 
he supports strict controls over strip 
m
national energy policies may undergo some changes under president
carter with greater emphasis on energy  and a strengthening
of environmental controls over energy  he plans to deemphasize nuclear development and to require stricter regulation in
construction of new nuclear power 
he evidently will push for
increased reliance on domestic coal from the deep mines of appalachia
and would oppose heavy development of  coal resources in
the western united  he opposes further expansion of western
 and supports strong state participation in offshore oil
lease 
he would favor mandatory mileage standards for
automobiles with economic penalties on those with less fuel 
he opposes federal subsidies for synthetic fuel

in the area of major new  we anticipate that
congress will act on the food surveillance 
this bill was
passed by the senate in  and was under active consideration by
the rogers committee in the house when congress 
among
its principal provisions is a requirement for the registration with
fda of all plants which manufacture foods or food 
it
 also impose on every segment of the food processing industry
rthe obligation of  by each  establishment
and adherence to adequate safety assurance procedures appropriate to
his 
these procedures are to identify areas in the 
turing process in which product adulteration is likely or possible
and set forth and implement effective measures to reduce or 
 the risk of 
the  senate bill offered no
guidelines on determining the  of the safety assurance
procedures and the vagueness of the new law may present substantial
compliance 
another important area which the senate bill addressed and
 we  congress will act upon in  is the impact of
the  supreme court decision in   
in the park 
the supreme court ruled that a corporate executive could be 
cuted under the criminal provisions of the  drug  cosmetic
act for product  irrespective of his personal ignorance

i would like to say a few words on the latter

upon initial review  toxic substances  many
of the regulatory affairs and legal people in the pharmaceutical

exemption from coverage accorded to  drugs and

briefly on our  activities for the past

these comments represent a considerable

recognized the validity of many of our points and indicated that
its implementation of the regulations would take into account the
concerns we 
the effectiveness of our  of  an industry
voice is to some extent limited by the limited time in which to submit
comments to the agency and the mca committee structure  which 
relies almost completely on the work product of the committee 
in the last  i believe that the  effectiveness
could be enhanced by more direct mca staff involvement with fda
representatives on issues of general interest and by more active
staff participation in the preparation of written input on agency

been concerned primarily with the legislative activity which led
up to enactment of the tax reform act of  on october 
last year when the house ways and means committee conducted

after passing the house late in  the tax reform act
was referred to the senate where it underwent hearings in the
senate finance committee this past 
at that  as you
will    perry  chairman of the board of
union  appeared on behalf of the 
our testimony before both committees was devoted to two
principal areas   capital formation and taxation of
foreign source 
in the capital formation area we recommended the adoption
of such tax incentives as making the  investment tax credit
 reducing the corporate income tax  and providing
additional cost recovery  we contended these actions
are needed to assist industry to generate sufficient funds
internally to meet capital 
in the foreign area we recommended that no change be made in
the foreign tax credit  and none with respect to the
timing of the imposition of  tax on foreign earnings of foreign
 the

 and to improv our balanc
of payments  we also

the tax reform act as finally enacted   is a
massive document containing many hundreds of provisions which will

in the foreign source income  the new tax law has a
numb r of disturbing  but it did not deal to any basic
extent with the two items of major concern to  namely the
timing of taxation of foreign source income  
and the foreign tax 
you will recall that a group of tax
 senators sponsored amendments to require current
taxation of the income of foreign subsidiaries of  companies
and to change the foreign tax credit to a  but their
proposals were all

ec formula proposes tariffs would be cut by their own  a
process that would be repeated four 
that is to  a

doing this four more times would mean an ultimate
tariff of 
the european version tends to embrace more
 in that it cuts the higher duties more than our
formula 
we remain critical of the ec proposal in that it specifically
excludes agricultural 
the common market still hopes
to keep this delicate subject separate from other trade 
the international trade committee shares the feeling that the
ec formula is not ambitious enough since it would result in an
av rage reduction of the current duties of about  and that
is before any exceptions are taken into 
i understand
that  ford during his visit to the summit meeting in puerto
rfco stated that the   should shoot for a target cut of 
of the current tariffs of our ec trading 
since
 ford was referring to a cut after exceptions are taken into
 you can see this leaves a wide gap for our negotiators

as to the timing of the final decision on the tariff

a major premise of this report is that business is
not as influential in washington as we would like it to

another and more recent development has been the rise

competition for his seat in the next primary and general

business has not been totally unresponsive to these

the last two  trade associations have become as
much a washington growth phenomenon as government 
and  within the last few years we have even
seen the ceo coming to washington to engage in direct
lobbying where an issue was of such paramount importance
to the corporation that it merited his personal 
this technique became so  in  that the
business roundtable was formed expressly to assure organized
ceo involvement in the lobbying 
but the washington corporate office and the trade
association and the ceo as lobbyists are not totally
responsive to  
what business lacks is a grassroots

members of congress are candid in saying this to your

how do we get a grassroots voice on capitol

 and the senate leadership deferred floor consideration until
after easter 
the key question appears to be the  tax
rebate but an additional complication is the apparent 
among democratic members who resent   recent cuts in
state water 
insofar as industry is  the major differences between
house and senate bills thus far are in the tax incentives 
the house version provides only for a new jobs credit of 
for each new  with a ceiling of  credit for each
 the senate version gives companies an option to take a
new jobs credit somewhat similar to the one in the house  or
to choose the investment tax  increased from  to

amendment to substitute a permanent reduction in personal income
taxes for the  this approach should receive solid support
from the  senate  but it is doubtful that enough
democrats will join   carter has hinted a veto of any bill 
containing a tax reduction because the administration considers
that a central part of its reform package expected this 
conservative democrats may sponsor an amendment to delete the
rebate without substituting any permanent tax 
another floor amendment fight could arise over a bill 
duced by senator frank    which would terminate

decisions of control agencies are transcending their past areas
of concern and are influencing such widely different facets as
land  life  industrial production  and
return on 
it is amazing that we have coped as w 
as we have with this complex 
oxidant air quality standard and control strategy
the oxidant or ozone air quality standard is the focal point
of much of our current 
there are those who say there
is too much ozone near the  and there are those who say
there is not enough in the  all we have to do is
restructure the atmosphere  our problems are just about that
complex and the outcome just about that 
you received
a briefing on the houston area oxidant study from  files and
others at your board meeting last

it is an important study and one that epa will not be able to

few believe in the  including   director
of  health effects research

the standard will not be changed

strategy to attain the standard is being tightened and will
require offsets for new

emissions located in areas where the oxidant standard is not
being met must somehow accomplish reductions in existing 
sions to more than offset the added

and  proposed offset solution are the result of clean air

  recent testimony on behalf of mca
before the senate and house strongly emphasized the need for
relief if orderly development in the nation is to 
 we are on strong technical ground in saying that
oxidant is relatively insensitive to changes in hydrocarbons
and that hydrocarbons cannot be controlled sufficiently in
most places to attain the oxidant 
los angeles is a
prime 
in   that county has reduced 
carbons from stationary source emissions by  and from vehicles
last  they exceeded the oxidant standard on over 

epa knows we cannot attain the standard in many 
but their new strategy is to make progress towards it by 
ing to reduce high oxidant concentrations in large metropolitan
areas and hence reduce the numbers of people at 
this
philosophy agrees with  recent congressional testimony
urging congress to modify the zero risk concept currently 
herent in the 
there is technical evidence that we can
make progress but at enormous cost to control stationary sources
and by imposition of drastic curtailment of vehicles by an
unwilling

 to epa emphasis on hydrocarbon 
the 
emphasis on controlling oxides of  a partner in 
chemical  can cause the  problem to spread further
into rural areas and lead to a buildup of oxides of nitrogen and
pose yet another potential health 
this is precisely what
is happening in the areas contiguous to los  mca has
conveyed to epa our  belief that hydrocarbon offset
is

while some adjustments in offset requirements now appear
 epa is not abandoning its broader thesis and has 
tified  states to revise their hydrocarbon control regulations

synthetic organic chemical  their purpose is to
develop federal new source performance standards and

 reasons for this study are that organics form
photochemical oxidants and organics are toxic with some being

epa states that synthetic organic chemicals contribute

the real nagging concern is the lack of any strength in the housing
market and no signs yet of any major move in plant and equipment

inflationary pressures are at least passive for the 
but  projections of shortages in primary  with only
slight increases in capacity utilization due to the lack of new
capacity installations in recent  are a cause for real
concern to 
the question of where eight million college students will get
jobs and what their reactions will be if they do not find the kind
of employment to which they feel they are  the continuing
decapitalization of primary  industry due to
inadequate depreciation policy and the failure to date of much of
industry to reduce its  ratios in order to compensate
for the shortfall in  the inability to economically
justify new plant expenditures on the basis of present profit
levels  all these concerns hang like a heavy cloud over a recovery
which to many is not as buoyant as they might have  admitting
that to others the lack of boom conditions is a good sign for a
lengthy recovery

outlook favorable for massive tax reform bill
it has taken two  over a thousand pages of  and

it must be considered
the most significant tax bill since  since it impacts the
taxation of every individual and corporation in the united

the bill extends through next  although in somewhat
different  the  tax cuts voted last year by

it places higher taxes on  taxpayers
through increased minimum taxes and reduction of  
it alters treatment of estate and gift  deductions for the

this is the first report of the energy conservation 
established by the board of directors at its november  
up to that  and beginning in october  an ad hoc committee
had dealt with energy conservation 
from october 
 the committee has  where legally  a
close liaison and active cooperation with the department of comm rce and with the fea and its 
since its 
two major 
the committee has been dealing with
 supervising the ongoing voluntary program of 
reports on energy conservation to the department of commerce and
the f deral energy 
as of the preparation of this
 the most recent energy conservation report was that submitt d in april  of this  in which  mca member companies

the report showed energy conservation for the
calendar year  as  per unit of  compared with 
as a base 
without the energy costs of osha and environmental
regulations in effect in  but not in  the energy 
tion rate would have been 
an  reason for the
relative modesty of these figures was  due to the 
our industry was operating at only  of capacity in  
pared with  in 
there are very few major mca member companies not taking part
in  energy reporting program or those of other relevant 
 such as the fertilizer institute and the pharmaceutical
manufacturers 
these few companies have been individually
 and will hopefully be taking part in the next report to
the two federal  due in 
this voluntary program is the result  october 
meeting between top commerce department and fea officials and top
officials of some  major chemical  all mca 
at
this  there was agr ement on a consensus energy conservation
goal of  per unit of output by calendar  as compared with
cma 
calendar

 since december  when the president signed into law
the energy policy and conservation  the committee has been
seeking to cope with the new industrial energy conservation 
visions which are part of this 
the act focuses on the ten leading  industries
by  sic  officially identified early this 
not
 our industry   ranks 
for each of these top   fea is to set an energy
conservation  replacing the consensus goals under which many
 including  have been 
fea has contracted
with outside consultants to study each of the ten industries and
propose goals   of  fea can accept or 
because of the complexity of the chemical  fea
initially had difficulty getting an appropriate contractor to take
on the 
 thanks in part to  interest in having a
qualified contractor take on this  battelle memorial
institute finally undertook  with chem systems as subcontractor
the engineering and technical subcommittee of the energy conservation
committee worked closely with the  aiding them individually
and collectively in their demanding  and contributing their 
pertise in 
the contractors have submitted their 
and it will be published in the federal register in late 
with public hearings in 
it is quite possible that consumer and environmental groups may
testify in opposition to any proposed reasonable target for our
 so mca must be prepared to testify in its own 
internal studies carried on by the committee indicate that the 
dustry can meet a target in the neighborhood of 
in further conformity with epca  fea must identify
the top  companies in each of the ten 
tified industries  either the   companies or
those using over a trillion  in energy per  whichever
number is 
some  companies reporting through mca have
listed energy purchases of over a trillion  a  and there
may be other such companies reporting through the fertilizer
 
it therefore seems likely that the  point
for chemical companies will be somewhat over a trillion  per
cma 
r
under epca provisions and  companies reporting
through industry programs such as  may be exempted from 
vidual  even if it would otherwise be required of 
the criteria for acceptable industry programs will be published in
the federal 
 because fea is falling behind its
epca  there remains a  chance that companies may
have to file at least one mandatory individual report in early 
another section of epca provides for the encouragement and
subsidy of state energy 
here  prime interest is in
exempting major industries like ours from reporting to the various
 since they already report to federal 
 
some states insist upon industrial energy conservation 
w would urge them to adopt the same system already in effect for
federal 
after monitoring two regional hearings on
state  mca testified to this effect at the plenary
hearing in washington in 
another area of fea concern outside of epca is its program
to promote fuel conversion from oil and gas to 
the future
issues subcommittee of the energy conservation committee has  the questionnaires to be sent out to companies in this 
and has made recommendations which have been persuasively relayed
to fea through a task force of the industrial energy users 
 a genuine success was realized in modifying some unreasonable 
quests   obtrusive financial questions in the major fuelburning installation 
the energy conservation committee has four 
engineering and  state  fuel  and future

it has also established fruitful liaison with three other
mca standing  government  legal  and
public 
government relations contacts have been useful in dealing with
legislation going through the congress concerned in one way or
another with energy 
public relations have helped in
the explanation of the effect on energy conservation of the
relatively low capacity at which the industry was functioning in
calendar   and our presentation in this regard was welcomed
by the department of commerce and the federal energy administration
as supportiv
of their reports to the 
 public
relations ass mbled and distributed internal and external 
tions by m mber companies designed to promote energy 
we shall look to legal advisory liaison for advice in preparing
testimony for the various public hearings which will be scheduled

john   chairman
patent and trademark committee
september 

you will recall that it is the responsibility of the patent
nd trademark committee to maintain an awareness of new developments
in the industrial property field having present or prospective impact
on the chemical  to determine mca positions where 
and to act either directly or through the board of  as is
 in making mca viewpoints 
last october i had the opportunity to report to you on the
status of patent legislation in the 
you will recall it was
predicted that  would be passed by the senate and forwarded to
 house for their 
you will also recall that in the
hkinion of your patent   is an  piece of
legislation which will have a serious negative impact on the value
of the patent 
 was passed by the senate and sent to the house with
little substantive amendment despite serious efforts by mca and others
 to modify and improve objectionable 
as of  it appears
unlikely that the house subcommittee responsible for patent legislation
will get to  this  and as a  it will die with this

while this is welcome news in that it maintains the status
quo for the time  we can very likely expect renewed activity
next 
i should note that several changes are needed to improve the
patent  and that the most important of these  a system for
the  of patents  is the subject of another bill
sponsored by  wiggins of 
 wiggins is minority
leader of the house subcommittee concerned with patent legislation
and he appears to be concerned with preserving and strengthening the
patent 
our committee is prepared to continue to assist in the
development of constructive changes in the law and its primary efforts
 continue to be geared in this 
i wish to speak briefly about what is happening in the   but before proceeding in that  i should note
at
patent committee has also provided comments to erda on a
 patent 
 we recommended a policy designed
attract participation in  research by companies
cma 
with a background and experience in the energy 
to this 
we urged adoption of a policy which would provide a flexible approach
to ownership of patents resulting from   and wh
would permit the government administrator to grant exclusive or
partially exclusive licenses to energy inventors where title is vested
in the

you are all aware of the changing attitudes of many of the developing

this has resulted in new laws in mexico and other south american

 a proposed new law in  and a great deal of activity
in various  agencies and the organization of american   
since a number of mca member companies are concerned with these 
we are seeking to define the part mca should play in this 
while to date our activity has been  we have been consulted
by and have provided our comments to the  government negotiators
with regard to efforts by developing countries to change the paris
convention on patents and 
in  and in response to 
notification of a proposed negative change in the patent law of
taiwan affecting the chemical  an ad hoc group of patent
committee  together with the  assistant commissioner of

play a role  and we will be attempting to define this role
more clearly in the coming
